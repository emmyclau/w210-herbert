Common charcoal is made from peat, coal, wood, coconut shell, or petroleum. ""Activated charcoal"" is similar to common charcoal. Manufacturers make activated charcoal by heating common charcoal in the presence of a gas. This process causes the charcoal to develop lots of internal spaces or ""pores."" These pores help activated charcoal ""trap"" chemicals.

Activated charcoal is commonly taken by mouth to treat poisonings. It is also used for intestinal gas (flatulence), high cholesterol, hangovers, upset stomach, and bile flow problems (cholestasis) during pregnancy. 

Activated charcoal is applied to the skin as part of bandages for helping heal wounds. ","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ACTIVATED CHARCOAL are as follows:Possibly effective for...Poisoning. Activated charcoal is useful for trapping chemicals to stop some types of poisoning when used as part of standard treatment. Activated charcoal should be given within 1 hour after a poison has been ingested. It does not seem to be beneficial if given for 2 or more hours after some types of poisoning. And activated charcoal doesn't seem to help stop all types of poisoning. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Lowering cholesterol levels. So far, research studies don't agree about the effectiveness of taking activated charcoal by mouth to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
Diarrhea caused by the cancer drug irinotecan. Irinotecan is a cancer drug known to cause diarrhea. Early research shows that taking activated charcoal during treatment with irinotecan decreases diarrhea, including severe diarrhea, in children taking this drug.
Decreasing gas (flatulence). Some studies show that activated charcoal is effective in reducing intestinal gas, but other studies don't agree. It's too early to come to a conclusion on this.
Indigestion. Some early research shows that taking certain combination products containing activated charcoal and simethicone, with or without magnesium oxide, can reduce pain, bloating, and feelings of fullness in people with indigestion. It's unclear if taking activated charcoal by itself will help.
Treating reduced bile flow (cholestasis) during pregnancy. Taking activated charcoal by mouth seems to help treat cholestasis in pregnancy, according to some early research reports.
Lowering phophate levels in people on dialysis. Early research shows that taking activated charcoal daily for 24 weeks might reduce phosphate levels in people on hemodialysis who have high phosphate levels.
Preventing hangover. Activated charcoal is included in some hangover remedies, but some experts are skeptical about how well it might work. Activated charcoal doesn't seem to trap alcohol well.
Toxic effects from the antiseizure drug phenytoin. Some early research shows that activated charcoal can help remove phenytoin from the body, bringing the phenytoin levels back to a normal range.
Wound healing. Studies on the use of activated charcoal for wound healing are mixed. Some early research shows that using bandages with activated charcoal helps wound healing in people with venous leg ulcers. But other research shows that activated charcoal does not help treat bed sores or venous leg ulcers.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of activated charcoal for these uses.","Activated charcoal works by ""trapping"" chemicals and preventing their absorption.","Activated charcoal is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth, short-term, or when applied to wounds. Side effects taking activated charcoal by mouth include constipation and black stools. More serious, but rare, side effects are a slowing or blockage of the intestinal tract, regurgitation into the lungs, and dehydration. 

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Activated charcoal might be safe when used short-term if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, but consult with your healthcare professional before using if you are pregnant.
Gastrointestinal (GI) blockage or slow movement of food through the intestine: Don't use activated charcoal if you have any kind of intestinal obstruction. Also, if you have a condition that slows the passage of food through your intestine (reduced peristalsis), don't use activated charcoal, unless you are being monitored by your healthcare provider.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/269.html,"Mulligan CM, Bragg AJ, O'Toole OB.

Alfalfa is an herb. People use the leaves, sprouts, and seeds to make medicine.

Alfalfa is used for kidney conditions, bladder and prostate conditions, and to increase urine flow. It is also used for high cholesterol, asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, upset stomach, and a bleeding disorder called thrombocytopenic purpura. People also take alfalfa as a source of vitamins A, C, E, and K4; and minerals calcium, potassium, phosphorous, and iron.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ALFALFA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...High cholesterol. Taking alfalfa seeds seems to lower total cholesterol and “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in people with high cholesterol levels.
Kidney problems.
Bladder problems.
Prostate problems.
Asthma.
Arthritis.
Diabetes.
Upset stomach.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate alfalfa for these uses.",Alfalfa seems to prevent cholesterol absorption in the gut.,"Alfalfa leaves are POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults. However, taking alfalfa seeds long-term is LIKELY UNSAFE. Alfalfa seed products may cause reactions that are similar to the autoimmune disease called lupus erythematosus. 

Alfalfa might also cause some people's skin to become extra sensitive to the sun. Wear sunblock outside, especially if you are light-skinned.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy or breast-feeding: Using alfalfa in amounts larger than what is commonly found in food is POSSIBLY UNSAFE during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There is some evidence that alfalfa may act like estrogen, and this might affect the pregnancy.
“Auto-immune diseases” such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Alfalfa might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. There are two case reports of SLE patients experiencing disease flare after taking alfalfa seed products long-term. If you have an auto-immune condition, it’s best to avoid using alfalfa until more is known.
Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Alfalfa might have the same effects as the female hormone estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don’t use alfalfa.
Diabetes: Alfalfa might lower blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes and take alfalfa, monitor your blood sugar levels closely.
Kidney transplant: There is one report of a kidney transplant rejection following the three-month use of a supplement that contained alfalfa and black cohosh. This outcome is more likely due to alfalfa than black cohosh. There is some evidence that alfalfa can boost the immune system and this might make the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine less effective.

American ginseng (Panax quinquefolis) is an herb that grows mainly in North America. Wild American ginseng is in such high demand that it has been declared a threatened or endangered species in some states in the United States.

People take American ginseng by mouth for stress, to boost the immune system, and as a stimulant.

American ginseng is often used to fight infections such as colds and flu. There is some evidence that it might help prevent colds and flu and make symptoms milder when infections do occur.

American ginseng is used for other infections including HIV/AIDS, infections of the intestine (dysentery), and particular infections (Pseudomonas infections) that are common in people with cystic fibrosis.

Some people use American ginseng to improve digestion and for loss of appetite, as well as for vomiting, inflammation of the colon (colitis), and inflammation of the lining of the stomach (gastritis).

American ginseng is also used for low iron in the blood (anemia), diabetes, insulin resistance related to HIV treatments, cancer-related fatigue, high blood pressure, trouble sleeping (insomnia), nerve pain, erectile dysfunction (ED), fever, hangover symptoms, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), blood and bleeding disorders, breast cancer, dizziness, headaches, convulsions, fibromyalgia, ""hardening of the arteries"" (atherosclerosis), memory loss, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, improving athletic performance, improving mental performance, as an anti-aging aid, menopausal symptoms, complications during pregnancy or childbirth, and for nervous exhaustion (neurasthenia).

You may also see American ginseng listed as an ingredient in some soft drinks. Oils and extracts made from American ginseng are used in soaps and cosmetics.

Don't confuse American ginseng with Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) or Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng). They have different medicinal effects.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for AMERICAN GINSENG are as follows:Possibly effective for...Diabetes. Taking 3 grams of American ginseng by mouth, up to two hours before a meal, can lower blood sugar after a meal in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, larger doses do not seem to have a greater effect. Taking 100-200 mg of American ginseng by mouth for 8 weeks might also help lower pre-meal blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Different American ginseng products may have different effects. Researchers think that is because they contain different amounts of the active chemicals called ginsenosides.
Respiratory tract infections. Some research suggests that taking a specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences, Canada) 200-400 mg twice daily for 3-6 months during flu season might prevent cold or flu symptoms in adults between the ages of 18 and 65. People older than 65 seem to need a flu shot at month 2 along with this treatment in order to decrease their risk of getting the flu or colds. This extract also seems to help make symptoms milder and last a shorter length of time when infections do occur. Some evidence suggests that the extract might not reduce the chance of getting the first cold of a season, but it seems to reduce the risk of getting repeat colds in a season. However, it might not help prevent cold or flu-like symptoms in patients with weakened immune systems.Possibly ineffective for...Athletic performance. Taking 1600 mg of American ginseng by mouth for 4 weeks does not seem to improve athletic performance. But it might decrease muscle damage during exercise.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Insulin resistance caused by HIV treatment. Early research shows that taking capsules containing 1 gram of American ginseng root three times daily for 14 days while receiving the drug indinavir, which is a type of HIV therapy, does not reduce insulin resistance caused by indinavir in healthy people.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is early evidence that a specific product (AD-fX, Afexa Life Sciences, Canada) containing American ginseng extract in combination with ginkgo leaf extract might help improve ADHD symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness in children aged 3-17 years.
Breast cancer. Some studies conducted in China suggest that breast cancer patients treated with any form of ginseng (American or Panax) do better and feel better. However, this may not be a result of taking the ginseng, because the patients in the study were also more likely to be treated with the prescription cancer drug tamoxifen. It is difficult to know how much of the benefit to attribute to ginseng.
Cancer-related fatigue. Research on the effects of American ginseng in people with fatigue related to cancer is not consistent. One study shows that taking 700-2000 mg of American ginseng daily for 8 weeks does not reduce fatigue in people with cancer. However, other research shows that taking 2000 mg of American ginseng in two doses daily for 8 weeks reduces fatigue by 51%. The conflicting results might be due to the different methods used to measure fatigue in the studies.
Mental performance. Some research suggests that taking one 100-400 mg dose of American ginseng (Cereboost, Naturex) 1-6 hours before mental tests improves short-term memory and reaction time in healthy people.
High blood pressure. Evidence on the effects of American ginseng in people with high blood pressure is not consistent. Some research shows that taking 1500 mg of American ginseng twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce blood pressure. But other research shows that taking 1000 mg of American ginseng extract three times daily for 12 weeks lowers blood pressure in people with diabetes and high blood pressure. The differences in the research might be related to the amount of ginsenosides, the active chemical in American ginseng, that is contained in the products used.
Menopausal symptoms. Early research suggests that taking a product containing American ginseng, black cohosh, dong quai, milk thistle, red clover, and vitex agnus-castus (Phyto-Female Complex, SupHerb, Netanya, Israel) twice daily for 3 months reduces menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep quality. However, it is not clear if these effects are caused by American ginseng or the other ingredients in the product.
Schizophrenia. Early research shows that American ginseng might improve some mental symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Taking 100 mg of a specific American ginseng extract called HT1001 (Afexa Life Sciences, Canada) twice daily for 4 weeks improves the patient's ability to hold visual information in the mind short-term. This treatment might also reduce some physical side effects of antipsychotic drugs. However, it does not improve other mental symptoms.

More evidence is needed to rate American ginseng for these uses.","American ginseng contains chemicals called ginsenosides that seem to affect insulin levels in the body and lower blood sugar. Other chemicals, called polysaccharides, might affect the immune system.","American ginseng is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately, short-term. Doses of 100-3000 mg daily have been used safely for up to 12 weeks. Single doses of up to 10 grams have also been safely used. In addition, a specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences, Canada) has also been used safely for up to 6 months.

When taken by mouth, American ginseng can cause some side effects including diarrhea, itching, trouble sleeping (insomnia), headache, and nervousness. In some people, American ginseng might also cause rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure or decreased blood pressure, breast tenderness, vaginal bleeding in women, and other side effects. Uncommon side effects that have been reported include a severe rash called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, liver damage, and severe allergic reaction.

Special precautions & warnings:
Children: American ginseng is POSSIBLY SAFE for children when taken by mouth appropriately, short-term. A specific American ginseng extract called CVT-E002 (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences, Canada) has been used in doses of 4.5-26 mg/kg daily for 3 days in children 3-12 years-old.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: American ginseng is POSSIBLY UNSAFE in pregnancy. One of the chemicals in Panax ginseng, a plant related to American ginseng, has been linked to possible birth defects. Do not take American ginseng if you are pregnant.

There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking American ginseng if you are breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Diabetes: American ginseng might lower blood sugar. In people with diabetes who are taking medications to lower blood sugar, adding American ginseng might lower it too much. Monitor your blood sugar closely if you have diabetes and use American ginseng.
Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: American ginseng preparations that contain chemicals called ginsenosides might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use American ginseng that contains ginsenosides. However, some American ginseng extracts have had the ginsenosides removed (Cold-FX, Afexa Life Sciences, Canada). American ginseng extracts such as these that contain no ginsenosides or contain only a low concentration of ginsenosides do not appear to act like estrogen.
Trouble sleeping (insomnia): High doses of American ginseng have been linked with insomnia. If you have trouble sleeping, use American ginseng with caution.
Schizophrenia (a mental disorder): High doses of American ginseng have been linked with sleep problems and agitation in people with schizophrenia . Be careful when using American ginseng if you have schizophrenia.
Surgery: American ginseng might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking American ginseng at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/967.html,"McElhaney JE, Simor AE, McNeil S, Predy GN.

Arnica is an herb that grows mainly in Siberia and central Europe, as well as temperate climates in North America. The flowers of the plant are used in medicine.

Arnica is most commonly used for pain caused by osteoarthritis, sore throat, surgery, and other conditions. Arnica is also used for bleeding, bruising, swelling after surgery, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Arnica can also be unsafe when taken by mouth. 

In foods, arnica is a flavor ingredient in beverages, frozen dairy desserts, candy, baked goods, gelatins, and puddings.

In manufacturing, arnica is used in hair tonics and anti-dandruff preparations. The oil is used in perfumes and cosmetics.

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ARNICA are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Osteoarthritis.
Early research shows that using an arnica gel product (A.

Other research shows that using the same gel works as well as the painkiller ibuprofen in reducing pain and improving function in the hands.Possibly ineffective for...
Reducing pain, swelling, and complications of wisdom tooth removal. In most research, taking arnica by mouth does not seem to reduce pain, swelling, or complications after wisdom tooth removal. One early study suggests that taking six doses of homeopathic arnica 30C might reduce pain, but not bleeding.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Bleeding. Early research suggests that placing 5 drops of a homeopathic arnica preparation under the tongue three times per day might reduce blood loss following surgery for breast cancer. But problems with the design of this study limit the reliability of these results.
Bruises. Most research shows that taking homeopathic arnica by mouth or applying arnica to the skin does not reduce bruising after surgery. But several conflicting studies shows benefit. 
Vision problems due to diabetes. Early research shows that taking homeopathic arnica by mouth for 6 months reduces vision problems in people with vision loss due to diabetes.
Muscle soreness after exercise. Most research shows that taking homeopathic preparations of arnica by mouth does not prevent muscle soreness after exercise. It's unclear if applying arnica to the skin after exercise prevents muscle soreness. Some research shows benefit. But other research shows that applying arnica to the skin can worsen muscle pain after exercise.
Swelling after surgery. The effects of arnica on swelling when applied to the skin after surgery is unclear. Some research shows a slight benefit. But other research shows that applying arnica doesn't reduce swelling after surgery. 
Pain after surgery. Most research shows that taking homeopathic arnica by mouth slightly reduces pain after surgery. In some cases, homeopathic arnica has been used together with an arnica ointment from 72 hours after surgery for 2 weeks. But not all research has been positive. 
Stroke. Early research shows that taking one tablet of homeopathic arnica 30C under the tongue every 2 hours for six doses does not benefit people who have had a stroke.
Acne.
Chapped lips.
Insect bites.
Painful, swollen veins near the surface of the skin.
Sore throats.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of arnica for these uses.","The active chemicals in arnica may reduce swelling, decrease pain, and act as antibiotics.","Arnica is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in the amounts commonly found in food or when applied to unbroken skin short-term. The Canadian government, however, is concerned enough about the safety of arnica to prohibit its use as a food ingredient.

Amounts that are larger than the amount found in food are LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth. In fact, arnica is considered poisonous and has caused death. When taken by mouth it can also cause irritation of the mouth and throat, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, an increase in blood pressure, heart damage, organ failure, increased bleeding, coma, and death.

Arnica is often listed as an ingredient in homeopathic products; however, these products are usually so dilute that they contain little or no detectable amount of arnica.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Don't take arnica by mouth or apply to the skin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. It is considered LIKELY UNSAFE.
Allergy to ragweed and related plants: Arnica may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before applying it to your skin. Do not take arnica by mouth.
Broken skin: Don't apply arnica to damaged or broken skin. Too much could be absorbed.
Digestion problems: Arnica can irritate the digestive system. Don't take it if you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcers, Crohn's disease, or other stomach or intestinal conditions.
 Fast heart rate: Arnica might increase your heart rate. Don't take arnica if you have a fast heart rate.
 High blood pressure: Arnica might increase blood pressure. Don't take arnica if you have high blood pressure.
Surgery: Arnica might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery.

Ashwagandha is a plant. The root and berry are used to make medicine.

Ashwagandha has a lot of uses. But so far, there isn't enough information to judge whether it is effective for any of them.

Ashwagandha is used for arthritis, anxiety, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), balance, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), trouble sleeping (insomnia), tumors, tuberculosis, asthma, a skin condition marked by white patchiness (leukoderma), bronchitis, backache, fibromyalgia, menstrual problems, hiccups, Parkinson's disease, under-active thyroid (hypothyroidism), and chronic liver disease. It is also used to reduce side effects of medications used to treat cancer and schizophrenia. Ashwagandha is used to reduce levels of fat and sugar in the blood.

Ashwagandha is also used as an ""adaptogen"" to help the body cope with daily stress, and as a general tonic.
 
Some people also use ashwagandha for improving thinking ability, decreasing pain and swelling (inflammation), and preventing the effects of aging. It is also used for fertility problems in men and women and also to increase sexual desire.

Ashwagandha is applied to the skin for treating wounds, backache, and one-sided paralysis (hemiplegia).

The name Ashwagandha is from the Sanskrit language and is a combination of the word ashva, meaning horse, and gandha, meaning smell. The root has a strong aroma that is described as ""horse-like.""

In Ayurvedic, Indian, and Unani medicine, ashwagandha is described as ""Indian ginseng.""  Ashwagandha is also used in traditional African medicine for a variety of ailments.

Don't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ASHWAGANDHA are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Stress. Taking a specific ashwagandha root extract (KSM66, Ixoreal Biomed) 300 mg twice daily after food for 60 days appears to improve symptoms of stress.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Reducing side effects associated with medications called antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia but they can cause levels of fat and sugar in the blood to increase. Taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Cap Strelaxin, M/s Pharmanza Herbal Pvt. Ltd.) 400 mg three times daily for one month might reduce levels of fat and sugar in the blood in people using these medications.
Anxiety. Some clinical research shows that taking ashwagandha can reduce some symptoms of anxiety or anxious mood.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some clinical research shows that a combination herbal product containing ashwagandha may improve attention and impulse control in children with ADHD. The effect of ashwagandha alone is unclear.
Bipolar disorder. Taking a specific ashwagandha extract (Sensoril, Natreon, Inc.) for 8 weeks might improve brain function in people being treated for bipolar disorder.
A brain condition called cerebellar ataxia. Preliminary research shows that ashwagandha in combination with an alternative form of medicine known as Ayurvedic therapy might improve balance in people with cerebellar ataxia.
Fatigue in people treated for cancer (chemotherapy). Early research suggests taking a specific ashwagandha extract 2,000 mg (Himalaya Drug Co, New Delhi, India) during chemotherapy treatment might reduce feelings of tiredness.
Diabetes. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.
High cholesterol. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might reduce cholesterol levels in patients with high cholesterol.
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). People with underactive thyroid have high blood levels of a hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). People with underactive thyroid can also have low levels of thyroid hormone. Taking ashwagandha seems to lower TSH and increase thyroid hormone levels in people with a mild form of underactive thyroid. 
Male infertility. Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that ashwagandha might improve sperm quality, but not sperm count, in infertile men. It is not known if taking ashwagandha can actually improve fertility.
Osteoarthritis. Early research shows that ashwagandha taken along with a zinc complex, guggul, and turmeric might improve arthritis symptoms. The impact of ashwagandha alone is unclear.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Early research shows that ashwagandha root extract might reduce symptoms of OCD when taken with prescribed medications for 6 weeks better than taking the prescribed medication alone.
Parkinson's disease.  Preliminary research suggests that a combination of herbs including ashwagandha improves Parkinson's symptoms. The effect of ashwagandha alone in Parkinson's is unknown.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research shows that ashwagandha powder taken for 3 weeks followed by 4 weeks of sidh makardhwaj (a mixture of gold, mercury, and sulfur) slightly improves symptoms in some people with RA. The impact of ashwagandha alone in RA is unclear.
Increasing interest in sex. Early research shows that taking ashwagandha extract daily for 8 weeks along with receiving counseling increases interest in sex and sexual satisfaction in adult women with sexual dysfunction better than counseling alone.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of ashwagandha for these uses.","Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling (inflammation), lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system.","Ashwagandha is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth short-term. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known. Large doses of ashwagandha might cause stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting.

It's not known whether it's safe to apply ashwagandha directly to the skin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Do not use ashwagandha if you are pregnant. It is rated LIKELY UNSAFE during pregnancy. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might cause miscarriages. Not enough is known about the use of ashwagandha during breast-feeding.  Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Diabetes: Ashwagandha might lower blood sugar levels. This could interfere with medications used for diabetes and cause blood sugar levels to go to low. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar closely.
High or low blood pressure: Ashwagandha might decrease blood pressure. This could cause blood pressure to go to low in people with low blood pressure; or interfere with medications used to treat high blood pressure. Ashwagandha should be used cautiously if you have low blood pressure or take medications for your blood pressure.
Stomach ulcers: Ashwagandha can irritate the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Don't use ashwagandha if you have a stomach ulcer.
""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Ashwagandha might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using ashwagandha.
Surgery: Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system. Healthcare  providers worry that anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery might increase this effect. Stop taking ashwagandha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Thyroid disorders: Ashwagandha might increase thyroid hormone levels. Ashwagandha should be used cautiously or avoided if you have a thyroid condition or take thyroid hormone medications.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/953.html,"Sharma AK, Basu I, Singh S.

Bacillus coagulans is a type of bacteria. It is used similarly to lactobacillus and other probiotics as ""beneficial"" bacteria.

People take Bacillus coagulans for diarrhea, including infectious types such as rotaviral diarrhea in children; traveler's diarrhea; and diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Bacillus coagulans is also used for general digestion problems, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), a bowel disorder called Clostridium difficile colitis, excessive growth of ""bad"" bacteria in the intestine, and infection due to the ulcer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori.

Some people use Bacillus coagulans to prevent respiratory infections and ramp up the immune system. It is also used to prevent cancer or the formation of cancer-causing agents. There is also some interest in using it as an additive to vaccines to improve their effectiveness.

Bacillus coagulans produces lactic acid and, as a result, is often misclassified as lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus. In fact, some commercial products containing Bacillus coagulans are marketed as Lactobacillus sporogenes or ""spore-forming lactic acid bacterium."" Unlike lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus or bifidobacteria, Bacillus coagulans forms reproductive structures called spores. Spores are actually an important factor in telling Bacillus coagulans apart from lactic acid bacteria.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BACILLUS COAGULANS are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...

Bee pollen refers to the flower pollen that collects on the legs and bodies of worker bees. It can also include some nectar and bee saliva. Pollens come from many plants, so the contents of bee pollen can vary significantly. Don’t confuse bee pollen with bee venom, honey, or royal jelly.

People commonly take bee pollen for nutrition. It is also used by mouth as an appetite stimulant, to improve stamina and athletic performance, and for premature aging, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BEE POLLEN are as follows:Possibly ineffective for...Athletic performance.

More evidence is needed to rate bee pollen for these uses.","Bee pollen might help stimulate the immune system when taken by mouth or promote wound healing when applied to the skin. However, it’s not clear how bee pollen causes these effects. Some people say that the enzymes in bee pollen act like medicines. However, these enzymes are broken down in the stomach, so it is unlikely that taking bee pollen enzymes by mouth causes these effects.","Bee pollen is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 30 days. There is also some evidence that taking two tablets twice daily of a specific combination product that contains 6 mg of royal jelly, 36 mg of bee pollen extract, bee pollen, and 120 mg of pistil extract per tablet for up to 2 months may be safe.

The biggest safety concerns are allergic reactions. Bee pollen can cause serious allergic reactions in people who are allergic to pollen.

There have also been rare reports of other serious side effects such as liver and kidney damage or photosensitivity. But it is not known if bee pollen or some other factor was truly responsible for these effects. Also, a single case of dizziness has been reported for a person who took bee pollen extract, royal jelly, and bee pollen plus pistil extract.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Taking bee pollen is POSSIBLY UNSAFE during pregnancy. There is some concern that bee pollen might stimulate the uterus and threaten the pregnancy. Don’t use it. It’s also best to avoid using bee pollen during breast-feeding. Not enough is known about how bee pollen might affect the infant.

Belladonna is a plant. The leaf and root are used to make medicine.

The name ""belladonna"" means ""beautiful lady,"" and was chosen because of a risky practice in Italy. The belladonna berry juice was used historically in Italy to enlarge the pupils of women, giving them a striking appearance. This was not a good idea, because belladonna can be poisonous.

Since 2010, the FDA has been cracking down on homeopathic infant teething tablets and gels. These products may contain inaccurate doses of belladonna. Serious side effects including seizures, breathing problems, tiredness, constipation, difficulty urinating, and agitation have been reported in infants taking these products.

Though widely regarded as unsafe, belladonna is taken by mouth as a sedative, to stop bronchial spasms in asthma and whooping cough, and as a cold and hay fever remedy. It is also used for Parkinson's disease, colic, inflammatory bowel disease, motion sickness, and as a painkiller.

Belladonna is used in ointments that are applied to the skin for joint pain, pain along the sciatic nerve, and general nerve pain. Belladonna is also used in plasters (medicine-filled gauze applied to the skin) for mental disorders, inability to control muscle movements, excessive sweating, and asthma.

Belladonna is also used as suppositories for hemorrhoids.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BELLADONNA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Taking belladonna by mouth along with the drug phenobarbital does not improve symptoms of this condition.
Arthritis-like pain.
Asthma.
Colds.
Hay fever.
Hemorrhoids.
Motion sickness.
Nerve problems.
Parkinson's disease.
Spasms and colic-like pain in the stomach and bile ducts.
Whooping cough.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of belladonna for these uses.","Belladonna has chemicals that can block functions of the body's nervous system. Some of the body functions regulated by the nervous system include salivation, sweating, pupil size, urination, digestive functions, and others. Belladonna can also cause increased heart rate and blood pressure.","Belladonna is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in adults and children. It contains chemicals that can be toxic.

Side effects of belladonna result from its effects on the body's nervous system. Symptoms include dry mouth, enlarged pupils, blurred vision, red dry skin, fever, fast heartbeat, inability to urinate or sweat, hallucinations, spasms, mental problems, convulsions, coma, and others.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Belladonna is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Belladonna contains potentially toxic chemicals and has been linked to reports of serious side effects. Belladonna is also LIKELY UNSAFE during breast-feeding. It can reduce milk production and also passes into breast milk.
Congestive heart failure (CHF): Belladonna might cause rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) and might make CHF worse.
Constipation: Belladonna might make constipation worse.
Down syndrome: People with Down syndrome might be extra-sensitive to the potentially toxic chemicals in belladonna and their harmful effects.
Esophageal reflux: Belladonna might make esophageal reflux worse.
Fever: Belladonna might increase the risk of overheating in people with fever.
Stomach ulcers: Belladonna might make stomach ulcers worse.
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract infections: Belladonna might slow emptying of the intestine, causing retention of bacteria and viruses that can cause infection.
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract blockage: Belladonna might make obstructive GI tract diseases (including atony, paralytic ileus, and stenosis) worse.
Hiatal hernia: Belladonna might make hiatal hernia worse.
High blood pressure: Taking large amounts of belladonna can increase blood pressure. This might make blood pressure become too high in people with high blood pressure.
Narrow-angle glaucoma: Belladonna might make narrow-angle glaucoma worse.
Psychiatric disorders. Taking large amounts of belladonna might worsen psychiatric disorders.
Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia): Belladonna might make rapid heartbeat worse.
Ulcerative colitis: Belladonna might promote complications of ulcerative colitis, including toxic megacolon.
Difficulty urinating (urinary retention): Belladonna might make this urinary retention worse.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/531.html,"Abbasi J.

Berberine is a chemical found in several plants including European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric.

Berberine is most commonly taken by mouth for diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.

Some people apply berberine directly to the skin to treat burns and canker sores.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BERBERINE are as follows:Possibly effective for...Canker sores. Research shows that applying a gel containing berberine can reduce pain, redness, oozing, and the size of ulcers in people with canker sores. 
Diabetes. Berberine seems to slightly reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Also, some early research suggests that taking 500 mg of berberine 2-3 times daily for up to 3 months might control blood sugar as effectively as metformin or rosiglitazone.
High cholesterol. Berberine might help lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. Taking 500 mg twice daily for up to 1 year seems to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol.
High blood pressure. Taking 0.9 grams of berberine per day along with the blood pressure-lowering drug amlodipine reduces systolic blood pressure (the top number) and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) better than taking amlodipine alone in people with high blood pressure.
An ovary disorder known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Research shows that berberine can lower blood sugar, improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, reduce testosterone levels, and lower waist-to-hip ratio in women with PCOS. Berberine may even lower blood sugar levels similar to metformin and may improve cholesterol levels better than metformin. It is unclear if berberine increases pregnancy rates or live birth rates in women with PCOS. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Burns. Early research suggests that applying an ointment that contains berberine and beta-sitosterol can treat second-degree burns as effectively as conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine.
Congestive heart failure (CHF). Early research suggests that berberine can reduce some of the symptoms and lower the death rate in some people with congestive heart failure.
Heart disease. Research shows that taking a specific product containing berberine and other ingredients for 3 months lowers cholesterol levels in people with heart disease who had a procedure called a percutaneous intervention (PCI). This product seems to lower cholesterol levels more than the standard medication ezetimibe, which is used to lower cholesterol. Also taking this product in combination with low doses of medicines called ""statins"" seems to work better than taking low-dose statins alone. It's unclear if the effects of this product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. It's also unknown whether this product reduces the risk of major adverse heart-related events in people with heart disease.
Diarrhea. Some early research suggests that taking 400 mg of berberine sulfate can decrease diarrhea in people with certain bacterial infectionsE. coli infection or cholera. Also, taking 150 mg of berberine hydrochloride three times per day seems to speed up recovery time for people with diarrhea when added to some standard treatments. Berberine seems to help treat diarrhea in infants and children similar to some antibiotics or probiotics. However, berberine does not seem to enhance the effects of the antibiotic tetracycline in treating diarrhea related to cholera infection.
Glaucoma. Early research suggests that using eye drops containing berberine and tetrahydrozoline for does not reduce eye pressure in people with glaucoma better than eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline alone.
Stomach ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection. Early research suggests that taking berberine is more effective than the drug ranitidine at treating H. pylori infection. But berberine seems less effective at healing ulcers in people with stomach ulcers due to H. pylori. Other research shows that berberine might treat H. pylori infection as well as the medication bismuth when taken in combination with a standard three-drug regimen for H. pylori infection.  
Hepatitis. Early research suggests that berberine decreases blood sugar, blood fats called triglycerides, and markers of liver damage in people with diabetes and hepatitis B or C.
Condition of the large intestine (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Early research shows taking that berberine twice daily for 8 weeks might reduce diarrhea and stomach pain and might improve quality of life in people with IBS with diarrhea. 
Menopausal symptoms. Early research suggests that taking a combination of berberine and soy isoflavones can reduce menopausal symptoms. However, it's not clear if berberine reduces menopausal symptoms if used alone.
Metabolic syndrome. Early research suggests that berberine reduces body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (the top number), blood fats called triglycerides, and blood sugar levels in people with metabolic syndrome. It also seems to improve insulin sensitivity. Other early research suggests that taking a combination product containing berberine, policosanol, red yeast rice, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin improves blood pressure and blood flow in people with metabolic syndrome.
Liver disease not caused by alcohol. Early research suggests that berberine reduces fat in the blood and markers of liver injury in people with diabetes and liver disease not caused by alcohol. Other early research shows that berberine might reduce fat on the liver, markers of liver injury, and weight in people with this condition. Berberine seems to work about as well as the medication pioglitazone. 
Obesity. Early research suggests that taking berberine can reduce weight in obese people by about 5 pounds.
Osteoporosis. Early research suggests that taking berberine together with vitamin D3, vitamin K, and a chemical found in hops can decrease bone loss in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Its not known if berberine is beneficial if taken by itself.
Injuries caused by radiation. Some early research suggests that taking berberine during radiation therapy can reduce the occurrence and severity of some injuries caused by radiation in patients being treated for cancer.
Low blood platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Blood platelets are important for blood clotting. Early research suggests that taking berberine either alone or with prednisolone, can increase the number of blood platelets in people with low blood platelet counts.
Trachoma. There is some evidence that eye drops containing berberine might be useful for treating trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of berberine for these uses.",Berberine might cause stronger heartbeats. This might help people with certain heart conditions. Berberine might also help regulate how the body uses sugar in the blood. This might help people with diabetes. It also might also be able to kill bacteria and reduce swelling.,"Berberine is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults for short-term use when taken by mouth or applied to the skin.
Special precautions & warnings:
Children: It's LIKELY UNSAFE to give berberine to newborns. It can cause kernicterus, a rare type of brain damage that can occur in newborns who have severe jaundice. Jaundice is yellowing of the skin caused by too much bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a chemical that is produced when the old red cells break down. It is normally removed by the liver. Berberine may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: It's LIKELY UNSAFE to take berberine by mouth if you are pregnant. Researchers believe berberine can cross the placenta and might cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus, a type of brain damage, has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine.

It's also LIKELY UNSAFE to take berberine if you are breast-feeding. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk, and it might cause harm.
Diabetes: Berberine can lower blood sugar. Theoretically, berberine may cause blood sugar to become too low if taken by diabetics who are controlling their blood sugar with insulin or medications. Use with caution in people with diabetes.
High bilirubin levels in the blood in infants: Bilirubin is a chemical that is produced when the old red blood cells break down. It is normally removed by the liver. Berberine may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough. This can cause brain problems, especially in infants with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Avoid using.
Low blood pressure: Berberine can lower blood pressure. Theoretically, berberine might increase the risk of blood pressure becoming too low in people who already have low blood pressure.

Beta-carotene is one of a group of red, orange, and yellow pigments called carotenoids. Beta-carotene and other carotenoids provide approximately 50% of the vitamin A needed in the American diet. Beta-carotene can be found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It can also be made in a laboratory.

Beta-carotene is used to prevent certain cancers, heart disease, cataracts, osteoarthritis, and age related macular degeneration (AMD). It is also used to treat chronic fatigue syndrome, aging skin, AIDS, alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, headache, heartburn, a bacterial infection that may cause ulcers (Helicobacter pylori infection), high blood pressure, infertility, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, stroke, and skin disorders including psoriasis and vitiligo. It is used to reduce symptoms of breathing disorders such as asthma and exercise-induced asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also used to improve memory and muscle strength. Some people use beta-carotene to reduce toxicity associated with chemotherapy, including the development of white patches or swelling and ulcers that occur inside the mouth. It is also taken by mouth to prevent the development of new moles on the skin, death due to long-term liver disease, a disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the enlargement of a blood vessel located near the abdomen (abdominal aneurysm).

Beta-carotene is also in used in malnourished (underfed) women to reduce the chance of death and night blindness during pregnancy, as well as diarrhea and fever after giving birth.

Some people take beta-carotene by mouth to prevent sunburn. Also, people take beta-carotene by mouth to prevent sensitivity to sunlight resulting from certain diseases such as erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) or polymorphous light eruption.

There are many authorities - including the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the World Cancer Research Institute in association with the American Institute for Cancer Research, and the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer - that recommend getting beta-carotene and other antioxidants from food instead of supplements, at least until research finds out whether supplements offer the same benefits. Eating five servings of fruits and vegetables daily provides 6-8 mg of beta-carotene.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BETA-CAROTENE are as follows:Effective for...Treating sun sensitivity in people who have a form of inherited blood disorder called ""erythropoietic protoporphyria."" Taking beta-carotene by mouth can reduce sensitivity to the sun in people with erythropoietic protoporphyria.
Possibly effective for...
An eye disease called age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Taking beta-carotene by mouth along with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc seems to help prevent vision loss and worsening of AMD in people with more severe AMD. Taking this combination might reduce the progression of AMD to a more advanced state in people at low risk, but results are conflicting. Taking beta-carotene plus antioxidants but without zinc does not seem to improve advanced AMD. There is conflicting evidence about whether taking beta-carotene as part of the diet helps reduce the risk of developing AMD.
Breast cancer. Eating more fruits and vegetable that contain beta-carotene seems decrease the risk of breast cancer in pre-menopausal women who are at high risk of getting breast cancer. These include women with a family history of breast cancer and those who use alcohol excessively.
Preventing complications post-childbirth. Taking beta-carotene by mouth before, during, and after pregnancy seems to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and fever after childbirth.
Pregnancy-related complications. Taking beta-carotene by mouth seems to reduce the risk of pregnancy-related death, pregnancy-related night blindness, and post-childbirth diarrhea and fever in underfed women.
Sunburn. Taking beta-carotene by mouth may decrease sunburn in people sensitive to the sun. However, taking beta-carotene is unlikely to have much effect on sunburn risk in most people. Also, beta-carotene does not appear to reduce the risk of skin cancer or other skin disorders associated with sun exposure.
Possibly ineffective for...
Preventing abdominal aortic aneurysm, or the enlargement of a large vessel running through the abdomen. Research suggests that taking beta-carotene by mouth for about 5.8 years does not prevent the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm in male smokers.
Alzheimer's disease. Eating a diet that contains a higher amount of beta-carotene does not seem to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Cataracts. Taking beta-carotene alone or in combination with vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc, for up to 8 years is unlikely to reduce the incidence or progression of cataracts.
Cystic fibrosis. Taking beta-carotene by mouth for up to 14 months does not improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis.
Diabetes. Some early research suggests that eating a diet containing higher amounts of beta-carotene is linked with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, taking beta-carotene supplements does not reduce the risk of developing diabetes or diabetes-related complications.
Moles. Research shows that taking beta-carotene by mouth for 3 years does not reduce the development of new moles.
Liver cancer. Taking beta-carotene alone or with vitamin E for 5-8 years does not prevent liver cancer in men who smoke.
Liver disease. Taking beta-carotene alone or with vitamin E for 5-8 years does not prevent death due to liver disease in men who smoke.
Overall risk of death. Some research suggests that taking supplements containing beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc for about 7 years might lower the risk of death in men. However, it doesn't seem to benefit women. Also, other research shows that taking larger doses of beta-carotene in for up to 12 years may increase the risk of death in both men and women.
Stroke. Taking beta-carotene by mouth for about 6 years does not reduce the risk of stroke in male smokers. Also, there is some evidence that taking beta-carotene supplements increases the risk of bleeding in the brain in people who drink alcohol.
Likely ineffective for...
Cancer. Most research shows that taking beta-carotene does not prevent or decrease death from uterine cancer, cervical cancer, thyroid cancer, bladder cancer, skin cancers, brain cancer, or blood cancer (leukemia). However, some research suggests a combination of beta-carotene with vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and zinc might lower cancer rates in men, but not women. Researchers speculate that men have lower intake of dietary antioxidants and therefore might benefit more from supplements.
Heart disease. A Science Advisory from the American Heart Association states that the evidence does not justify use of antioxidants such as beta-carotene for reducing the risk of heart disease. Evidence also shows that beta-carotene in combination with vitamin C and E does not decrease heart disease risk.
Colon cancer. Most research shows that taking beta-carotene by mouth, alone or with vitamins C and E, selenium, and calcium carbonate, does not decrease the risk of colon tumor growth. It also doesn't seem to reduce the risk of colon tumor recurrence in people who have had colon tumors removed, although it might reduce the risk of colon tumor recurrence in people who never drink or smoke. However, in people that smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol, taking beta-carotene supplements increases the risk of new tumors. It is unclear if dietary beta-carotene reduces the risk of colon cancer.
Lung cancer. Taking beta-carotene seems to increase the risk of lung cancer in people who smoke, people who used to smoke, people exposed to asbestos, and those who use alcohol in addition to smoking. However, beta-carotene from food does not seem to have this adverse effect. Taking supplements containing beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium for about 5 years does not reduce the risk of death in people previously diagnosed with lung cancer.
Prostate cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements does not prevent prostate cancer in most men. In fact, there is some concern that beta-carotene supplements might actually increase the risk of prostate cancer in some men. There is evidence that men who take a multivitamin daily along with a separate beta-carotene supplement have an increased risk of developing advanced prostate cancer. Also, men who smoke and take beta-carotene supplements have in increased risk of developing prostate cancer.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Aging skin. Early research shows that taking 30 mg of beta-carotene daily may reduce signs of skin aging. However, taking 90 mg of beta-carotene daily doesnt have any benefit. 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Taking beta-carotene supplements doesn't seem to reduce the risk of ALS. However, eating a diet high in beta-carotene seems to reduce the risk of ALS.
Asthma. Eating a diet high in beta-carotene does not seem to be linked with a reduced risk of asthma.
Side effects from chemotherapy. Eating a diet high in beta-carotene is linked with reduced toxic effects in children undergoing chemotherapy for a blood cancer called lymphoblastic leukemia.
Preventing complications of lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD). Eating more beta-carotene in the diet seems to help prevent bronchitis and difficulty breathing in smokers with COPD. But beta-carotene supplements do not.
Mental performance. Some research suggests that taking beta-carotene for one year does not improve thinking skills and memory in older men. However, taking beta-carotene for up to 18 years may improve these outcomes. 
Esophageal cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with vitamin A or vitamin E plus vitamin C doesn't seem to reduce the risk of esophageal cancer.
Asthma attacks triggered by exercise. Taking beta-carotene by mouth seems to prevent asthma attacks that are triggered by exercise.
Stomach cancer. Some research suggests that taking beta-carotene does not decrease risk of stomach cancer. Also, taking beta-carotene in combination with vitamins A, C, and/or E does not seem to reduce the risk of stomach cancer. However, some early research suggests that taking beta-carotene, vitamin E, and selenium might reduce the risk of stomach cancer in underfed, Chinese people who are at high risk. Also, taking beta-carotene seems to help treat precancerous lesions in the stomach in people at risk for stomach cancer. 
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection, which causes stomach ulcers. Taking beta-carotene by mouth, in combination with prescription drugs, does not help treat H. pylori infection better than prescription drugs alone. 
HIV/AIDS. Some early research suggests that taking beta-carotene by mouth for 4 weeks helps improve immune system function in people with HIV. However, conflicting evidence exists.
White patches on the tongue and mouth called oral leukoplakia. It is unclear if taking beta-carotene by mouth decreases symptoms of oral leukoplakia. Some research suggests that it might when taken up to 12 months. However, at least in people that do not smoke, beta-carotene does not seem to help reduce symptoms or prevent mouth cancer. 
Swelling and ulcers in the lining of the mouth (oral mucositis). Taking beta-carotene by mouth doesn't appear to prevent the development of oral mucositis during radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
Osteoarthritis. Higher dietary intake of beta-carotene may prevent osteoarthritis from getting worse, but it does not seem to prevent osteoarthritis.
Ovarian cancer. Eating a diet rich in carotenoids, including beta-carotene, may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women after menopause.
Pancreatic cancer. Taking beta-carotene supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants such as vitamin A or vitamin E doesn't seem to reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.
Physical performance. Eating a diet that contains a higher amount of beta-carotene seems to improve physical performance and muscle strength in older people.
A skin rash due to sun sensitivity called polymorphous light eruption. Some research suggests that taking beta-carotene by mouth can improve sensitivity to sun exposure in people with polymorphous light eruptions. However, conflicting research exists.

More evidence is needed to rate beta-carotene for these uses.
","Beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A, an essential nutrient. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, which help to protect cells from damage.","Beta-carotene is LIKELY SAFE in adults and children when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts for certain specific medical conditions. However, beta-carotene supplements are not recommended for general use.

Beta-carotene is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high doses, especially when taken long-term. High doses of beta-carotene can turn skin yellow or orange.

There is growing concern that taking high doses of antioxidant supplements such as beta-carotene might do more harm than good. Some research shows that taking high doses of beta-carotene supplements might increase the chance of death from all causes, increase the risk of certain cancers, and possibly other serious side effects. In addition, there is also concern that taking large amounts of a multivitamin plus a separate beta-carotene supplement increases the chance of developing advanced prostate cancer in men.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Beta-carotene is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. However, large doses of beta-carotene supplements are not recommended for general use during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Angioplasty, a heart procedure: There is some concern that when antioxidant vitamins, including beta-carotene, are used together they might have harmful effects after angioplasty. They can interfere with healing. Don't use beta-carotene and other antioxidant vitamins before or after angioplasty without the recommendation of your healthcare provider.
History of asbestos exposure: In people who have been exposed to asbestos, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of cancer. Dont take beta-carotene supplements if you have been exposed to asbestos.
Smoking. In people who smoke, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of colon, lung, and prostate cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you smoke.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/999.html,"Ribeiro BD, Barreto DW, Coelho MAZ. Technological Aspects of ß-Carotene Production.

Bifidobacteria are a group of bacteria that normally live in the intestines. They can be grown outside the body and then taken by mouth as medicine.

Bifidobacteria are commonly used for diarrhea, constipation, an intestinal disorder called irritable bowel syndrome, for preventing the common cold or flu, and lots of other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BIFIDOBACTERIA are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Constipation. Most research shows that taking bifidobacteria can increase bowel movements by about 1.5 stools per week in people with constipation. But not all strains of bifidobacteria seem to work.
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Taking bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus along with standard H. pylori therapy might help get rid of H. pylori infections about twice as well as taking standard H. pylori therapy alone. It can also reduce side effects such as diarrhea and bad taste from H. pylori therapy.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Most research shows that taking bifidobacteria for 4-8 weeks can reduce IBS symptoms such as stomach pain, bloating, and difficulty having a bowel movement. It might also reduce symptoms such as anxiety and depression in people with IBS. But not all strains of bifidobacteria seem to work.
A complication after surgery for ulcerative colitis called pouchitis. Taking a combination of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus, with or without streptococcus, by mouth seems to help prevent pouchitis after surgery for ulcerative colitis.
Airway infections. Most research shows that using probiotics containing bifidobacteria helps prevent airway infections such as the common cold in otherwise healthy people, including school-aged children and college students. But taking bifidobacteria does not seem to reduce the risk of airway infections in hospitalized children and teens.
Diarrhea in infants (rotaviral diarrhea). Giving bifidobacteria to infants with rotaviral diarrhea can shorten the duration of diarrhea by about one day.
Traveler's diarrhea. Taking bifidobacteria helps prevent traveler's diarrhea when used with other probiotics such as lactobacillus or streptococcus.
Ulcerative colitis. Research shows that taking probiotics containing bifidobacterium along with lactobacillus and streptococcus can help increase remission rate by almost 2-fold in people with active ulcerative colitis. However, most research shows that bifidobacterium is not beneficial for preventing relapse.Possibly ineffective for...
Diarrhea due to an infection with the bacteria Clostridium difficile. Most research shows that taking bifidobacteria along with other probiotics does not prevent diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile infection.
Mortality of premature babies. Adding bifidobacteria to infant formula does not reduce the risk of death in premature babies.
Infant development. Giving formula containing bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus does not improve growth in infants.
Damage to the intestinal tract in preterm infants (Necrotizing enterocolitis; NEC). Research shows that giving bifidobacteria to preterm infants does not prevent necrotizing enterocolitis or death from any cause.
Blood infection (sepsis). Adding bifidobacteria to infant formula does not prevent sepsis in premature babies.
Weight loss. Taking bifidobacterium for 6 months does not improve weight loss in people who are overweight or obese.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Research shows that taking bifidobacteria along with antibiotics can reduce the chance of diarrhea by about 45%. But some conflicting results exist. It is possible that bifidobacteria might prevent diarrhea caused by some antibiotics but not others. Also, bifidobacteria might work better when used in certain combinations with lactobacillus and streptococcus. But not all combination seem to work.
Scaly, itchy skin (eczema). Some research shows that giving bifidobacterium to infants can help TREAT eczema, but conflicting results exist. Other research shows that giving bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus to pregnant women during the last 2 months of pregnancy, and then giving to the infant for the first 2 months after birth, can help PREVENT eczema. But conflicting results exist. Giving bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus to only at-risk infants during the first 6 months of life does not prevent eczema.
Bipolar disorder. Early research shows that taking bifidobacterium with lactobacillus GG seems to reduce the likelihood that a person with bipolar disorder will be hospitalized for psychotic symptoms. It also seems to decrease the time they spend in the hospital.
Celiac disease. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria as part of a gluten-free diet does not improve stomach and intestinal symptoms compared to diet alone in children with newly diagnosed celiac disease.
Infections related to chemotherapy treatment. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus or bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus plus enterococcus does not prevent yeast infections in people with leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy.
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria along with lactobacillus helps lower fasting blood sugar and insulin levels in people with diabetes during pregnancy.
Muscle pain caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria plus streptococcus doesn't reduce muscle soreness caused by lifting weights. But it does seem to improve range of motion during follow-up exercises despite muscle soreness.
High cholesterol. Early research shows that drinking milk containing bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus can reduce ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by a small amount in adults and children with high cholesterol. But its effects on ""good"" high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are conflicting.
Japanese cedar pollen allergy. Some research shows that taking bifidobacteria during pollen season reduces nose and eye symptoms of Japanese cedar pollen allergy. But conflicting results exists. Bifidobacteria does not seem to reduce sneezing or throat symptoms associated with Japanese cedar pollen allergy.
Preventing infections after exposure to radiation. Early research shows that antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria can help improve short-term survival in the treatment of radiation sickness. In combination with antibiotics, bifidobacteria appear to help prevent dangerous bacteria from growing and causing a serious infection.
Arthritis. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus does not reduce symptom severity or lessen joint pain in people with moderate-to-severe arthritis.
Aging.
Breast pain, possibly due to infection (mastitis).
Cancer.
Lactose intolerance.
Liver problems.
Lyme disease.
Mumps.
Replacing beneficial bacteria removed by diarrhea.
Stomach problems.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate bifidobacteria for these uses.","Bifidobacteria belong to a group of bacteria called lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are found in fermented foods like yogurt and cheese. Bifidobacteria are used in treatment as so-called ""probiotics,"" the opposite of antibiotics. They are considered ""friendly"" bacteria and are taken to grow and multiply in areas of the body where they normally would occur. The human body counts on its normal bacteria to perform several jobs, including breaking down foods, helping the body take in nutrients, and preventing the take-over of ""bad"" bacteria. Probiotics such as bifidobacteria are typically used in cases when a disease occurs or might occur due to a kill-off of normal bacteria. For example, treatment with antibiotics can destroy disease-causing bacteria, but also normal bacteria in the GI (gastrointestinal) and urinary tracts. The theory is that taking Bifidobacterium probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize the death of good bacteria and the take-over by bad bacteria.","Bifidobacteria are LIKELY SAFE for adults and children when taken by mouth appropriately. In some people, treatment with bifidobacteria might upset the stomach and intestine, causing diarrhea, bloating and gas.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: A specific strain of bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum, is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately for 6 weeks while pregnant. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking other bifidobacteria strains if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Weakened immune system: There is some concern that ""probiotics"" might grow too well in people with a weak immune system and cause infections. Although this has not occurred specifically with bifidobacteria, there have been rare cases involving other probiotic species such as Lactobacillus. If you have a weakened immune system (e.g., you have HIV/AIDS or are undergoing cancer treatment), check with your healthcare provider before using bifidobacteria.
Blockage in the intestines: Two cases of blood infections have been reported for infants given bifidobacteria probiotics. In both cases, the infants had had stomach surgery. It's thought that the blood infections resulted from intestinal blockage caused by the stomach surgeries, which allowed the bifidobacteria to cross into the bloodstream. In one case, taking bifidobacteria after the intestinal blockage was corrected did not cause another blood infection. Therefore the risk of blood infections is not a concern for most infants taking bifidobacteria. But bifidobacteria should be used cautiously or avoided in infants with stomach or intestinal blockages.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/891.html,"Staudacher HM, Lomer MCE, Farquharson FM, et al.

Biotin is a vitamin. It is found in small amounts in many foods such as eggs, milk, or bananas.

Biotin is  commonly used for hair loss, brittle nails, nerve damage, and many other conditions.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BIOTIN are as follows:Likely effective for...Biotin deficiency. Taking biotin can help treat low blood levels of biotin. It can also prevent blood levels of biotin from becoming too low. Low blood levels of biotin can cause thinning of the hair and rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Other symptoms include depression, lack of interest, hallucinations, and tingling in the arms and legs. Low biotin levels can occur in people who are pregnant, who have had long-term tube feeding, who are malnourished, who have undergone rapid weight loss, or who have a specific inherited condition. Cigarette smoking might also cause low blood levels of biotin.Possibly ineffective for...
Skin rash in infants (seborrheic dermatitis). Taking biotin does not seem to help improve rash in infants.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hair loss. Taking biotin and zinc by mouth in addition to applying a steroid cream to the skin might help reduce hair loss.
An inherited disorder called biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. People with this condition experience episodes of altered mental state and muscle problems. Early research shows that taking biotin plus thiamine does not prevent these episodes better than taking thiamine alone. But the combination might shorten how long the episodes last when they do occur. 
Brittle fingernails and toenails. Taking biotin by mouth for up to a year might increase the thickness of fingernails and toenails in people with brittle nails.
Diabetes. Some early research shows that taking biotin along with chromium might lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. However, taking biotin alone doesn't seem to improve blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. 
Diabetic nerve pain. Early research shows that taking biotin by mouth or receiving it as a shot might reduce nerve pain in the legs of people with diabetes.
Muscle cramps related to dialysis. People receiving dialysis tend to have muscle cramps. Early research shows that taking biotin by mouth might reduce muscle cramps in these people.
Multiple sclerosis. Early research shows that taking high-dose biotin might improve vision and reduce partial paralysis in some people with multiple sclerosis. 
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate biotin for these uses.
","Biotin is an important component of enzymes in the body that break down certain substances like fats, carbohydrates, and others.

There isn't a good laboratory test for detecting low biotin levels, so this condition is usually identified by its symptoms, which include thinning of the hair (frequently with loss of hair color) and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Other symptoms include depression, tiredness, hallucinations, and tingling of the arms and legs. There is some evidence that diabetes could cause low biotin levels.","Biotin is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth  appropriately or when applied to the skin as cosmetic products that contain 0.0001% to 0.6% biotin. Biotin is well tolerated when used at recommended dosages. It is POSSIBLY SAFE when given as a shot.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Biotin is POSSIBLY SAFE when used in recommended amounts during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Children: Biotin is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth and appropriately.
An inherited condition in which the body cannot process biotin (biotinidase deficiency): People with this condition might need extra biotin.
Kidney dialysis: People receiving kidney dialysis may need extra biotin. Check with your health care provider.
Smoking: People who smoke might have low biotin levels and may need a biotin supplement.
Laboratory tests: Taking biotin supplements might interfere with the results of many different blood  lab tests. Biotin can cause falsely high or falsely low test results. This might lead to missed or incorrect diagnoses. Tell your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements, especially if you are having lab tests done as you may need to stop taking biotin before your blood test. Most multivitamins contain low doses of biotin, which are not likely to interfere with blood tests, but talk to your doctor to be sure.

Bitter melon is a vegetable used in India and other Asian countries. The fruit and seeds are used to make medicine.

People use bitter melon for diabetes, stomach and intestinal problems, to promote menstruation, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BITTER MELON are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Diabetes. Research is conflicting and inconclusive. Some research shows that taking bitter melon can reduce blood sugar levels and lower HbA1c (a measure of blood sugar control over time) in people with type 2 diabetes. But these studies have some flaws, and not all research agrees. Higher quality studies are needed.
Prediabetes. Early research shows that bitter melon does not reduce blood sugar in people with prediabetes. 
HIV/AIDS.
Kidney stones.
Liver disease.
Psoriasis.
Skin abscesses and wounds.
Stomach and intestinal disorders.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of bitter melon for these uses.",Bitter melon contains a chemical that acts like insulin to help reduce blood sugar levels.,"Bitter melon is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth short-term (up to 3 months). Bitter melon may cause an upset stomach in some people. The safety of long-term use of bitter melon is not known. There also is not enough information about the safety of applying bitter melon directly to the skin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Bitter melon is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Certain chemicals in bitter melon might start menstrual bleeding and have caused abortion in animals. Not enough is known about the safety of using bitter melon during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Diabetes: Bitter melon can lower blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes and take medications to lower your blood sugar, adding bitter melon might make your blood sugar drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar carefully.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency: People with G6PD deficiency might develop ""favism"" after eating bitter melon seeds. Favism is a condition named after the fava bean, which is thought to cause ""tired blood"" (anemia), headache, fever, stomach pain, and coma in certain people.  A chemical found in bitter melon seeds is related to chemicals in fava beans. If you have G6PD deficiency, avoid bitter melon.
Surgery: There is a concern that bitter melon might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using bitter melon at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/795.html,"Konishi T, Satsu H, Hatsugai Y, et al.

Black psyllium is a plant. People use the seed to make medicine. Be careful not to confuse black psyllium with other forms of psyllium including blond psyllium.

Black psyllium is used for chronic constipation and for softening stools in conditions such as hemorrhoids, cracks in the skin around the anus (anal fissures), surgery on the rectum, and pregnancy. It is also used for diarrhea, dysentery, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), cancer, high cholesterol, and reducing the risk of coronary heart disease.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BLACK PSYLLIUM are as follows:Effective for...Constipation. Black psyllium is safe and effective for short-term, over-the-counter use for treating constipation.Likely effective for...
Coronary heart disease. Foods containing black psyllium can help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. The daily intake of psyllium must be at least 7 grams and it must be combined with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Diabetes. Early research suggests that taking black psyllium by mouth might help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by reducing how quickly sugars are absorbed from food.
Obesity. Early research shows that taking black psyllium by mouth can slightly decrease body weight and body mass index in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who are overweight. But it doesn’t work better than standard care for NAFLD.
Cancer.
Diarrhea.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of black psyllium for these uses.","Black psyllium adds bulk to the stool which might help with constipation, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. It also controls how quickly sugars are absorbed from the gut, which might help control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.","Black psyllium, when taken by mouth with enough water, is LIKELY SAFE for most people. Mild side effects include bloating and gas. In some people, black psyllium can cause allergic reactions such as runny nose, red eyes, rash, and asthma, or, rarely, a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.

Black psyllium is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth without enough water. Be sure to take black psyllium with plenty of water. Otherwise, you might choke. The concern is so important that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that black psyllium be labeled: ""WARNING: Taking this product without adequate fluid may cause it to swell and block your throat or esophagus and may cause choking. Do not take this product if you have difficulty in swallowing. If you experience chest pain, vomiting, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing after taking this product, seek immediate medical attention.”
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Taking black psyllium during pregnancy or breast-feeding seems to be LIKELY SAFE, as long as enough water is taken with the dose.
Diabetes: Black psyllium can lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes by slowing down absorption of sugars from foods. Monitor blood glucose levels closely if you have diabetes and use black psyllium. Doses of your medications for diabetes may need to be adjusted.
Intestinal problems: Don’t use black psyllium if you have impacted stools, a complication of constipation in which the stool hardens in the rectum and can’t be moved by usual movement of the bowel. Don’t use black psyllium if you have any condition that increases your risk of getting blockages in your intestines. The concern is that when black psyllium absorbs water and swells up, it might block the GI tract in people with these types of conditions.
Allergies: Some people are severely allergic to black psyllium. This is more likely to happen to people who have been exposed to black psyllium on the job, such as nurses who prepare doses of powdered laxatives, or workers in factories that process psyllium. These people shouldn’t use black psyllium.
Phenylketonuria: Some black psyllium products might be sweetened with aspartame (NutraSweet). If you have phenylketonuria, avoid these products.
Surgery: Because black psyllium might affect blood sugar levels, there is a concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using black psyllium at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Esophageal and swallowing disorders: People who have esophageal problems or trouble swallowing might be more likely to choke on black psyllium. If you have an esophageal problem or swallowing disorder, don’t use black psyllium.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/97.html,"Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration.

Black tea is a product made from the Camellia sinensis plant. The aged leaves and stems are used to make medicine. Green tea, which is made from fresh leaves of the same plant, has some different properties.

Black tea is used for improving mental alertness as well as learning, memory, and information processing skills. It is also used for treating headache; both low and high blood pressure; high cholesterol; preventing heart disease, including ""hardening of the arteries"" (atherosclerosis) and heart attack; preventing stroke; preventing Parkinson's disease; and reducing the risk of osteoporosis. Black tea is also taken by mouth to prevent cancer, including stomach and intestine cancer, colon and rectal cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, mouth cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cancer of the kidneys, cancer of the esophagus, and cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer). It is also used for type 2 diabetes, stomach disorders, vomiting, diarrhea, and to increase urine flow. Some people use black tea for preventing tooth decay and kidney stones. Black tea is also used to decrease stress. In combination with various other products, black tea is used for weight loss.

In foods, black tea is consumed as a hot or cold beverage.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BLACK TEA are as follows:Likely effective for...Mental alertness. Drinking black tea and other caffeinated beverages throughout the day helps to keep people alert and improve attention, even after extended periods without sleep. The effect appears to increase with increasing amount of caffeine in the caffeinated beverages.Possibly effective for...Low blood pressure after eating (postprandial hypotension).  Black tea contains caffeine. Drinking beverages containing caffeine helps increase blood pressure in older people who have low blood pressure after eating.
Heart attacks. Some research shows that people who drink black tea have a lower risk of having a heart attack. Also, people who have been drinking black tea for at least a year before having a heart attack seem to be less likely to die after having a heart attack.
Brittle bones (osteoporosis).  Early research suggests that older women who drink more black tea have stronger bones than those who drink less. Drinking more black tea also seems to be linked with a lower risk of hip fracture in older men and women.
Ovarian cancer. Women who regularly drink tea, including black tea or green tea, appear to have a lower risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to women who never or rarely drink tea.
Parkinson's disease. Some research shows that people who drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola have a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. The lower risk seems to be directly related to the dose of caffeine in men but not women. Drinking black tea also appears to be linked with a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease among people who smoke cigarettes.Possibly ineffective for...
Bladder cancer. People who drink tea, including black tea and green tea, do not seem to have a lower risk of bladder cancer compared to those who don't drink tea.
Breast cancer. People who drink black tea do not seem to have a lower risk of breast cancer compared to those who don't drink black tea.
Colon and rectal cancer. Some early research suggests that drinking black or green tea might be linked with a lower risk of colon and rectal cancer. However, most research shows that drinking tea is not linked with a lower risk of colon and rectal cancer. In fact, some early research suggests that drinking higher amounts of black tea might be linked with an increased risk of colon and rectal cancer.
Diabetes. Early research suggests that taking an extract of black and green tea does not improve average blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Other early research suggests that drinking at least one cup of black tea per day is not linked with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in Japanese adults.
Cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer). Women who drink more black tea do not seem to have a lower risk of developing endometrial cancer compared to those who drink less.
Cancer of the tube connecting the throat and stomach (esophageal cancer). People who drink higher amounts of black tea do not seem to have a lower risk of developing esophageal compared to those who drink less.
Stomach cancer. Some early research suggests that drinking black or green tea might be linked with a lower risk of stomach cancer. However, most research shows that people who drink black or green tea do not have a lower risk of stomach cancer. In fact, some early research suggests that people who drinking higher amounts of black tea might have an increased risk of stomach cancer compared to those who drink less.
Lung cancer. Early research found that drinking black tea is not linked with a reduced risk of lung cancer and may even be linked with an increased risk.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Early research suggests that people who drink black tea have a reduced risk of having their arteries become hardened compared to those who don't drink black tea. This link is stronger in women than men.
Heart disease. Some early research suggests that people who regularly drink black tea have a lower risk of developing heart disease. However, other research suggests that drinking black tea is linked with an increased risk of heart disease becoming worse or causing death.
Cavities. Early research suggests that rinsing with a black tea extract might help prevent cavities.
Diarrhea. Early research shows that taking black tea as tablets reduces watery stool in children with diarrhea.
High cholesterol. It is still not clear if drinking black tea helps to reduce levels of cholesterol in the blood. Some research shows that black tea might reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in people with normal or high cholesterol levels. However, other research shows that drinking black tea does not have these effects.
High blood pressure. Some research shows that drinking 3-5 cups per day of black tea or taking black tea extract can reduce blood pressure by a small amount in people with normal or high blood pressure. But not all research agrees. And the small reduction in blood pressure might not be clinically meaningful. 
Kidney stones. Women who drink one cup of tea, such as black tea, per day seem to have an lower risk of developing kidney stones compared to those who don't drink tea.
Pancreatic cancer. Some early research suggests that drinking black tea is linked with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. However, other research shows conflicting results.
Prostate cancer. Early research suggests that drinking black tea is linked with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
Kidney cancer. Early research suggests that people who drink higher amounts of black or green tea have an increased risk of developing kidney cancer.
Stress. Early research suggests that drinking black tea for 6 weeks does not improve blood pressure, heart rate, or feelings of stress ratings while performing stressful tasks.
Stroke. Black tea contains chemicals called flavonoids. Early research suggests that eating a diet that contains flavonoids is linked with a lower risk of stroke.
Weight loss. Early research shows that taking a product containing black tea extract plus green tea extract, asparagus, guarana, kidney bean, and mate along with a combination of kidney bean pods, garcinia, and chromium yeast for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight in overweight adults.
Headache.
Stomach disorders.
Vomiting.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of black tea for these uses.","Black tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine, which affects thinking and alertness, increases urine output, and may reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It also contains antioxidants and other substances that might help protect the heart and blood vessels.","Drinking moderate amounts of black tea is LIKELY SAFE for most adults.

Drinking too much black tea, such as more than five cups per day, is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. High amounts of black tea can cause side effects due to the caffeine in black tea. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache, nervousness, sleep problems, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, irregular heartbeat, tremor, heartburn, dizziness, ringing in the ears, convulsions, and confusion. Also, people who drink black tea or other caffeinated beverages all the time, especially in large amounts, can develop psychological dependence.

Drinking very high amounts of black tea containing more than 10 grams of caffeine is LIKELY UNSAFE. Doses of black tea this high might cause death or other severe side effects.
Special precautions & warnings:
Children: Black tea is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth by children in amounts commonly found in foods. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, drinking black tea in small amounts is POSSIBLY SAFE. Do not drink more than 2 cups a day of black tea. This amount of tea provides about 200 mg of caffeine. Consuming more than this amount during pregnancy is POSSIBLY UNSAFE and has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other negative effects, including symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborns and lower birth weight.

If you are breast-feeding, drinking more than 3 cups a day of black tea is POSSIBLY UNSAFE and might cause your baby to become more irritable and have more bowel movements.
Anemia: Drinking black tea may make anemia worse in people with iron deficiency.
Anxiety disorders: The caffeine in black tea might make these conditions worse.
Bleeding disorders: There is some reason to believe that the caffeine in black tea might slow blood clotting, though this hasn't been shown in people. Use caffeine cautiously if you have a bleeding disorder.
Heart problems: Caffeine in black tea can cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. If you have a heart condition, use caffeine with caution.
Diabetes: The caffeine in black tea might affect blood sugar. Use black tea with caution if you have diabetes.
Diarrhea: Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Seizures: Black tea contains caffeine. There is a concern that high doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't use high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing supplements such as black tea. 
Glaucoma: Drinking caffeinated black tea increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes.
Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Black tea might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use black tea.
High blood pressure: The caffeine in black tea might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this doesn't seem to occur in people who regularly drink black tea or other caffeinated products.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS.
Brittle bones (osteoporosis): Drinking caffeinated black tea can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. This might weaken bones. Don't drink more than 300 mg of caffeine per day (approximately 2-3 cups of black tea). Taking extra calcium may help to make up for calcium losses. Older women who have a genetic condition that affects the way they use vitamin D, should use caffeine with caution.
Overactive bladder: The caffeine in black tea might increase the risk of developing an overactive bladder. Also, black tea might increase symptoms in people who already have an overactive bladder. Black tea should be used with caution in these people.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/997.html,"Hodgson JM, Puddey IB, Woodman RJ, et al.

Blessed thistle is a plant. People use the flowering tops, leaves, and upper stems to make medicine. Blessed thistle was commonly used during the Middle Ages to treat the bubonic plague and as a tonic for monks.

Today, blessed thistle is prepared as a tea and used for loss of appetite and indigestion; and to treat colds, cough, fever, bacterial infections, and diarrhea. It is also used as a diuretic for increasing urine output, and for promoting the flow of breast milk in new mothers.

Some people soak gauze in blessed thistle and apply it to the skin for treating boils, wounds, and ulcers.

In manufacturing, blessed thistle is used as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages.

Blond psyllium is an herb. The seed and the outer covering of the seed (husk) are used to make medicine.

Blond psyllium is used orally as a laxative and for softening stools in people with hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and after anal surgery. It is also used for diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, and dysentery. Other uses include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions.

Some people apply blond psyllium to the skin as a poultice for boils.

In food manufacturing, blond psyllium is used as a thickener or stabilizer in some frozen dairy desserts.

Some foods that contain blond psyllium carry a label that claims these foods, when consumed as part of a low-fat diet, may reduce the risk of heart disease. The FDA allows this claim if the food contains at least 1.7 grams of psyllium per serving. The key word in this claim is ""may."" It is true that blond psyllium can help lower cholesterol levels; but there's no proof yet that taking blond psyllium reduces the risk of developing heart disease. Despite its effectiveness in lowering cholesterol levels, blond psyllium has not yet been included in the stepwise approaches to dietary therapy such as the American Heart Association Step I or Step II diets for high cholesterol. Most clinical studies have used a specific blond psyllium powder preparation (Metamucil) or food that contains psyllium seed husk, such as cereals, breads, or snack bars.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BLOND PSYLLIUM are as follows:Effective for...Constipation. Some evidence suggests that taking blond psyllium by mouth, alone or as a combination product, can relieve constipation and improve stool consistency.Likely effective for...High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Taking blond psyllium by mouth reduces cholesterol levels in people with mild to moderate high cholesterol. Blond psyllium seed husk or seed added to food or as a separate supplement in a dose of approximately 10-12 grams daily, in combination with a low-fat or a high-fat diet, can reduce levels of total cholesterol by 3% to 14% and low density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol by 5% to 10 after 7 weeks or more of treatment. Blond psyllium also does not seem to lower other blood fats called triglycerides. Lower doses of blond psyllium (no more than 6 grams daily) may not be effective.

In children with high cholesterol, taking psyllium can further decrease LDL cholesterol levels by 7% to 15% when added to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet such as the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 diet. Interestingly, taking blond psyllium along with a stricter low-fat, low-cholesterol diet such as the NCEP Step 2 diet may have less of an additional effect in lowering LDL cholesterol.

Psyllium seems to be less effective in older people. There is some evidence that it lowers LDL cholesterol levels to a lesser degree in people 60 years or older compared to people under 60. 

Some evidence suggests that psyllium seed might be more effective than the seed husk for lowering total cholesterol and increasing levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol.

Blond psyllium seems to be most effective when taken with foods at mealtime. Breakfast cereal containing blond psyllium can decrease total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by 5% and 9%, respectively.

There is some evidence that taking blond psyllium for high cholesterol makes it possible to reduce the dose of certain medications used to lower cholesterol. For example, taking 15 grams of blond psyllium (Metamucil) along with 10 mg of simvastatin (Zocor) daily seems to lower cholesterol about as well as taking a higher dose (20 mg) of simvastatin daily. Similarly, a combination of blond psyllium with colestipol (Colestid) at half their usual doses seems to be as effective as colestipol alone. Blond psyllium also seems to reduce colestipol and cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar) side effects such as constipation and abdominal pain. However, do not adjust the dose of your medication without consulting your healthcare provider.Possibly effective for...
Diabetes. Blond psyllium's maximum effect on the blood sugar levels occurs when psyllium is mixed with or taken with foods. In addition to lowering blood sugar, blond psyllium seed husk also lowers cholesterol in people with diabetes who have high cholesterol. Some studies show blond psyllium can lower total cholesterol by about 9%, and LDL cholesterol by 13%. Blond psyllium does not lower after-meal blood sugar levels in people who do not have diabetes.
Diarrhea. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to reduce diarrhea symptoms.
Hemorrhoids. Taking blond psyllium by mouth seems to relieve bleeding and pain in people with hemorrhoids.
High blood pressure. Taking blond psyllium by mouth, alone or in combination with soy protein, seems to lower blood pressure in adults.
A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). While not all studies agree, there is evidence that blond psyllium seed husk can relieve constipation and improve abdominal pain, diarrhea, and overall well-being. It may take up to four weeks of treatment to get the best results.
Obesity. While not all studies agree, there is early evidence that blond psyllium might reduce body weight and appetite in people who are overweight or obese.
Treating side effects of a drug called Orlistat (Xenical, Alli). Taking blond psyllium with each dose of orlistat seems to relieve orlistat side effects such as gas, stomach rumbling, stomach cramps, and oily spotting without decreasing the weight-reducing effect of orlistat.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). There is some evidence that taking blond psyllium seeds by mouth might be effective for preventing a relapse of inflammatory bowel disease. Blond psyllium also appears to relieve symptoms of this condition. 
Possibly ineffective for...Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Taking 3.5 grams of blond psyllium per day does not seem to reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma. There is some evidence that it might actually increase the risk of adenoma recurrence, particularly in people who get a lot of calcium from their diet. However, more evidence is needed to determine the relationship of psyllium and calcium to colorectal adenoma.
Serious kidney disease (end-stage renal disease or ESRD). Taking blond psyllium by mouth does not improve serious kidney disease.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Population research suggests that people who consume more blond psyllium in the diet might have a lower chance of dying from colorectal cancer.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease). Early research suggests that taking blond psyllium daily along with probiotics improves symptoms of Crohn disease. 
Changes in how fat is distributed in the body in people taking HIV medications. Eating a high fiber diet might prevent fat redistribution in people with HIV.
Persistent heartburn. Early research shows that taking blond psyllium for 10 days may help control symptoms of persistent heartburn in some people. 
Some types of cancer.
Some types of skin conditions.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate blond psyllium for these uses.","The husks of the psyllium seed absorb water and form a large mass. In people with constipation, this mass stimulates the bowel to move. In people with diarrhea, it can slow down the bowel and reduce bowel movements. This mass can also reduce the amount of cholesterol that is reabsorbed in to the body.","When taken by mouth: Blond psyllium is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth with plenty of fluids. Drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed. In some people, blond psyllium might cause gas, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, and nausea. It has also been linked to reports of headache, backache, runny nose, cough, and sinus problems.

Some people can have an allergic response to blond psyllium with symptoms such as swollen nasal passages, sneezing, swollen eyelids, hives, and asthma. Some people can also become sensitized to psyllium through exposure at work or repeated use of psyllium. Stop using blond psyllium and get medical attention immediately if you develop symptoms such as flushing, severe itching, shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling of the face or body, chest and throat tightness, or loss of consciousness.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Blond psyllium is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately.
Growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma): Blond psyllium might increase the risk of adenoma recurrence in people with a history of colorectal adenoma. People who have had this condition should avoid blond psyllium.
Diabetes: Blond psyllium can lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Monitor blood sugar levels closely. Doses of conventional antidiabetes medications may need adjustment. Another consideration is that some commercial blond psyllium products can contain added sugars that might increase blood sugar levels.
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders: Don't use blond psyllium if you tend to develop hard stools in the rectum due to ongoing constipation (fecal impaction), GI tract narrowing, obstruction, or conditions that can lead to obstruction, such as spastic bowel.
Allergy: Some patients can have severe hypersensitivity reactions to blond psyllium. This is more likely to occur in patients with previous occupational exposure to blond psyllium. Don't use blond psyllium if you are sensitive to it.
Low blood pressure: Blond psyllium can lower blood pressure in people with high and normal blood pressure. Taking blond psyllium might make blood pressure drop too low in people who already have low blood pressure.
Phenylketonuria: Some blond psyllium preparations are sweetened with aspartame (Nutrasweet) and should be avoided in patients with phenylketonuria.
Surgery: Blond psyllium might affect blood sugar levels, making blood sugar control more difficult during and after surgery. Stop taking blond psyllium at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Swallowing disorders: Do not use blond psyllium if you have problems swallowing. Blond psyllium might increase your risk of choking.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/866.html,"Noureddin S, Mohsen J, Payman A.

Blueberry is a plant. People use the fruit and leaves to make medicine.

Be careful not to confuse blueberry with bilberry. Outside of the United States, the name ""blueberry"" may be used for a plant called ""bilberry"" in the U.S.

Blueberry is used for a variety of conditions including improved memory and thinking skills, prevention of cancer and heart disease, and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and depression. But there is limited scientific research to support any of these uses. 

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BLUEBERRY are as follows:Possibly ineffective for...
High blood pressure. Most research shows that taking blueberry does not reduce blood pressure. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. Some research shows that taking blueberry daily for 3-6 months might help improve some thinking and memory tests in adults over 60 years of age. However, most tests for thinking and memory do not change. If there is a benefit, it is probably small.
Aging. Some research shows that eating frozen blueberries can improve foot placement and balance in elderly people. However, other research shows that eating blueberries does not help with these things. Also, eating blueberries doesn't seem to improve strength or walking speed in elderly people.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research shows that taking a single dose of blueberry may improve learning in children ages 7-10 years.
Depression. Some people that have a clot in one of the vessels in the brain may experience depression. In those people with depression, they may be more likely to have infections in the GI tract. Some research suggests that taking blueberry extract daily for 90 days can reduce symptoms of depression and also reduce infections in this group of people.
Arthritis in children (juvenile idiopathic arthritis). Early research shows that drinking blueberry juice daily while using the medication etanercept reduces symptoms of arthritis in children better than the medication alone. Drinking blueberry juice might also reduce side effects caused by etanercept.
Memory. Early research shows that drinking a single blueberry beverage does not significantly improve memory in children. 
Bad circulation.
Cancer.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Constipation.
Diarrhea.
Fever.
Hemorrhoids.
Labor pains.
Multiple sclerosis (MS).
Peyronie's disease (build-up of scar tissue in the penis).
Preventing cataracts and glaucoma.
Sore throat.
Ulcers.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Varicose veins.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of blueberry for these uses.","Blueberry, like its relative the cranberry, might help prevent bladder infections by stopping bacteria from attaching to the walls of the bladder. Blueberry fruit is high in fiber which could help normal digestive function. It also contains vitamin C and other antioxidants. Blueberry also contains chemicals that might reduce swelling and destroy cancer cells.","When taken by mouth: Blueberry fruit is LIKELY SAFE for most people when consumed in the amounts found in food. There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking blueberry leaf is safe or what the side effects might be.
When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if blueberry is safe when applied to the skin or what the side effects might be.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Blueberry fruit is LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts commonly found in foods. But not enough is known about the safety of the larger amounts used for medicine. Stick to normal food amounts if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Diabetes: Blueberry might lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes and use blueberry products. The dose of your diabetes medications may need to be adjusted by your healthcare provider.
Surgery: Blueberry might affect blood glucose levels and could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using blueberry at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1013.html,"Boespflug EL, Eliassen JC, Dudley JA, et al.

Blue-green algae refers to several species of bacteria that produce blue-green colored pigments. They grow in salt water and some large fresh water lakes. They have been used for food for several centuries in Mexico and some African countries. They have been sold as a supplement in the US since the late 1970s.

Blue-green algae products are sometimes used by mouth as a protein supplement and for treating high blood pressure. Blue-green algae products are also used by mouth for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Some blue-green algae products are grown under controlled conditions. Others are grown in a natural setting, where they are more likely to be contaminated by bacteria, liver poisons (microcystins) produced by certain bacteria, and heavy metals. Choose only products that have been tested and found to be free of these contaminants.

You may have been told that blue-green algae are an excellent source of protein. But, in reality, blue-green algae are no better than meat or milk as a protein source and cost about 30 times as much per gram.

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BLUE-GREEN ALGAE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
High blood pressure. Taking blue-green algae by mouth seems to reduce blood pressure in some people with high blood pressure.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hay fever. Early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth might relieve some allergy symptoms in adults.
Insulin resistance caused by drugs used to treat HIV/AIDS (antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance). Early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth increases insulin sensitivity in people with insulin resistance due to HIV/AIDS medication.
Arsenic poisoning. Early research shows that taking blue-green algae and zinc by mouth twice daily reduces arsenic levels and the effects of arsenic on the skin in people living in areas with high arsenic levels in the drinking water.
Athletic performance. The effect of blue-green algae on athletic performance is unclear. An early study shows that men who jog regularly are able to sprint for longer periods of time before becoming tired when they take blue-green algae. However, another early study shows that taking blue-green algae does not improve calories burned while exercising on an elliptical trainer machine.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early research shows that taking blue-green algae with a combination of herbs might improve ADHD scores in previously untreated children. But it's not clear if this is from blue-green algae, the other herbs, or the combination.
Tics or twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm). Early research shows that taking blue-green algae does not reduce eyelid spasms in people with blepharospasm.
Diabetes. An early study shows that people with type 2 diabetes who take blue-green algae by mouth have lower blood sugar levels.
Fatigue. Early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth does not improve fatigue in adults with long-term complaints of fatigue.
Hepatitis C. Research on the effects of blue-green algae in people with chronic hepatitis C has been inconsistent. One study shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth results in greater improvements in liver function compared to milk thistle in adults with hepatitis C who were not yet treated or were unresponsive to other treatments. However, another study shows that taking blue-green algae worsens liver function in people with hepatitis C or hepatitis B.
HIV/AIDS. Research on the effects of blue-green algae in people with HIV/AIDS is mixed. Some early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth reduces infections, stomach and intestinal problems, feelings of tiredness, and breathing problems in patients with HIV/AIDS. However, taking blue-green algae does not appear to improve CD4 cell counts or reduce viral load in HIV patients.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Early research shows that blue-green algae lowers cholesterol in people with normal or slightly elevated cholesterol levels. However, the research findings have been somewhat inconsistent. In some studies, blue-green algae only lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol. In other studies, blue-green algae lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol.
A condition caused by a poor diet or the body's inability to absorb nutrients. Early research on the use of blue-green algae in combination with other dietary treatments for malnutrition in infants and children shows conflicting results. Weight gain was seen in undernourished children who were given spirulina blue-green algae with a combination of millet, soy and peanut for 8 weeks. However, in another study, children up to 3 years-old who were given blue-green algae daily for 3 months did not gain weight more than those given general treatments to improve nutrition alone.
Symptoms of menopause. An early study shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth lowers anxiety and depression in women going through menopause. However, it doesn't appear to reduce symptoms such as hot flashes.
Mental alertness. An early study shows that taking blue-green algae improves feelings of mental tiredness and scores on a mental math test.
Obesity. Research on the effects of blue-green algae in people who are overweight or obese is unclear. Some early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth slightly improves weight loss in overweight adults. However, other studies show no weight loss with blue-green algae.
White patches inside the mouth that are usually caused by smoking (oral leukoplakia). Early research shows that taking blue-green algae by mouth reduces mouth sores in people who chew tobacco.
A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Early research shows that injecting a gel containing blue-green algae into the gums of adults with gum disease improves gum health.
Anxiety.
Low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia) due to iron deficiency.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
Cancer.
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD).
Depression.
Stress.
Fatigue.
Indigestion (dyspepsia).
Heart disease.
Memory.
Wound healing.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of blue-green algae for these uses.","Blue-green algae have a high protein, iron, and other mineral content which is absorbed when taken orally. Blue-green algae are being researched for their potential effects on the immune system, swelling (inflammation), and viral infections.","When taken by mouth: Blue-green algae products that are free of contaminants, such as liver-damaging substances called microcystins, toxic metals, and harmful bacteria, are POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when used short-term. Doses up to 19 grams per day have been used safely for up to 2 months. Lower doses of 10 grams per day have been used safely for up to 6 months. Side effects are typically mild and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, headache, and dizziness.

But blue-green algae products that are contaminated are POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, weakness, thirst, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don't use any blue-green algae product that hasn't been tested and found to be free of microcystins and other contamination.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough information available to know if it is safe to use blue-green algae when pregnant or breast-feeding. Contaminated blue-green algae products contain harmful toxins that might be transferred to an infant during pregnancy or through breast milk. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: Blue-green algae are POSSIBLY UNSAFE for children. Children are more sensitive to contaminated blue-green algae products than adults.
Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pemphigus vulgaris (a skin condition), and others: Blue-green algae might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using blue-green algae.
Bleeding disorders: Blue-green algae might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Phenylketonuria: The spirulina species of blue-green algae contains the chemical phenylalanine.  This might make phenylketonuria worse. Avoid Spirulina species blue-green algae products if you have phenylketonuria.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/923.html,"Yousefi R, Mottaghi A, Saidpour A.

Boron is a mineral that is found in food such as nuts and the environment. People take boron supplements as medicine.

Boron is used for boron deficiency and pain related to menstruation.

Women sometimes use capsules containing boric acid, the most common form of boron, inside the vagina to treat yeast infections.

People also apply boric acid to the skin as an astringent or to prevent infection; or use it as an eye wash.

Boron was used as a food preservative between 1870 and 1920, and during World Wars I and II.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for BORON are as follows:Likely effective for...Boron deficiency. Taking boron by mouth prevents boron deficiency.Possibly effective for...
Painful periods. Some research shows that taking boron 10 mg by mouth daily around the time of menstrual bleeding reduces pain in young women with painful periods.
Vaginal infections. Some research shows that boric acid, used inside the vagina, can successfully treat yeast infections (candidiasis), including infections that do not seem to get better with other medications and  treatments. However, the quality of this research is in question.

Possibly ineffective for...Athletic performance. Taking boron by mouth does not seem to improve body mass, muscle mass, or testosterone levels in male bodybuilders.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Improved thinking and coordination in older people. There is some early evidence that taking boron by mouth might improve mental processes like learning and memory and the ability to coordinate small muscle movements (fine motor skills) in older people.
Arthritis. Early research suggests that boron might be useful for decreasing pain related to arthritis.
Osteoporosis. Early research suggests that taking boron by mouth daily does not improve bone mass in postmenopausal women.
Skin rash during radiation. Early research shows that applying a boron-based gel 4 times a day on the skin area undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer might prevent skin rash related to radiation. 
Increasing testosterone.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of boron for these uses.","Boron seems to affect the way the body handles other minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. It also seems to increase estrogen levels in older (post-menopausal) women and healthy men. Estrogen is thought to be helpful in maintaining healthy bones and mental function. Boric acid, a common form of boron, can kill yeast that cause vaginal infections. Boron may have antioxidant effects. ","Boron is LIKELY SAFE for adults and children when used in doses less than the Upper Tolerable Limit (UL) (see dosage section below). There is some concern that doses over 20 mg per day, the UL for adults, might harm a man's ability to father a child.


Boric acid, a common form of boron, is LIKELY SAFE when used vaginally for up to six months. It can cause a sensation of vaginal burning.

Boron is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for adults and children when taken by mouth in high doses. Large quantities of boron can cause poisoning. Signs of poisoning include skin inflammation and peeling, irritability, tremors, convulsions, weakness, headaches, depression, diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms. 

Also, boric acid powder, a common form of boron, is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when applied in large amounts to prevent diaper rash.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Boron is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women age 19-50 when used in doses less that 20 mg per day. Pregnant and breast-feeding women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 17 mg per day. Taking boron by mouth in high doses is POSSIBLY UNSAFE while pregnant and breast feeding. Higher amounts may be harmful and should not be used by pregnant women because it has been linked to birth defects. Intravaginal boric acid has been associated with a 2.7-to 2.8-fold increased risk of birth defects when used during the first 4 months of pregnancy.
Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Boron might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, avoid supplemental boron or high amounts of boron from foods.
Kidney disease or problems with kidney function: Do not take boron supplements if you have kidney problems. The kidneys have to work hard to flush out boron.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/894.html,"Aysan E, Idiz UO, Elmas L, Saglam EK, Akgun Z, Yucel SB.

Calendula is a plant. The flower is used to make medicine.

Calendula flower is used to prevent muscle spasms, start menstrual periods, and reduce fever. It is also used for treating sore throat and mouth, menstrual cramps, cancer, and stomach and duodenal ulcers. Calendula has also been used for measles, smallpox, and jaundice.

Calendula is applied to the skin to reduce pain and swelling (inflammation) and to treat poorly healing wounds and leg ulcers. It is also applied to the skin (used topically) for nosebleeds, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, inflammation of the rectum (proctitis), ear infection, gum disease, peeling lips (exfoliative cheilitis), diaper rash, vaginal yeast infection, and inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis). Essential oil of calendula has been used as an insect repellant.

Don’t confuse calendula with ornamental marigolds of the Tagets genus, which are commonly grown in vegetable gardens.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CALENDULA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Anal tears (anal fissures). Early research suggests that that applying calendula to the affected area may reduce pain in people with anal tears who do not respond to treatment with sitz baths and the medication nifedipine.
Diabetic foot ulcers. Early research shows that using a calendula spray in addition to standard care and hygiene might prevent infection and decrease odor in people with long-term foot ulcer from diabetes.
Diaper rash. Some early research suggests that applying a calendula ointment to the skin for 10 days improves diaper rash compared to aloe gel.  But other early research shows that applying calendula cream does not improve diaper rash as effectively as bentonite solution. 
Peeling lips (exfoliative cheilitis). Early research shows that using calendula ointment for 15 days might help stop peeling lips.
Gum inflammation. Early research shows that rinsing the mouth with a specific calendula tincture for 6 months might decrease plaque, gum inflammation, and bleeding by 10% to 18% compared to using water to rinse. Other early research shows that rinsing the mouth with a combination mouthwash containing calendula, rosemary, and ginger for 2 weeks decreases plaque, gum inflammation, and bleeding compared to placebo mouthwash. In fact, it the combination mouthwash seems to work as effectively as chlorhexidine mouthwash. 
Insect repellant. Applying calendula essential oil to the skin does not seem to repel mosquitoes as effectively as applying DEET.
Ear infections (otitis media). Early research shows that applying a specific product that contains mullein, garlic, calendula, and St. John’s wort to the ear for 3 days reduces ear pain in children and teenagers with ear infections.
Pressure ulcers. Early research shows that using a specific calendula product might improve the healing of long-term pressure ulcers.
Skin inflammation due to radiation therapy (radiation dermatitis). Early research suggests that applying calendula ointment on the skin might reduce radiation dermatitis in people receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer. However, other early research shows that using a calendula cream is no different than petroleum jelly for reducing radiation dermatitis.
Thinning of the wall of the vagina (vaginal atrophy). Early research suggests that applying a gel containing calendula, Lactobacillus sporogenes, isoflavones, and lactic acid to the vagina for 4 weeks reduces symptoms of vaginal atrophy such as vaginal itching, burning, dryness, and pain during intercourse.
Vaginal yeast infection. Early research shows that applying calendula cream inside the vagina for 7 days does not treat yeast infections as effectively as using clotrimazole cream.
Leg ulcers. Early research shows that applying a calendula ointment to the skin speeds up the healing of leg ulcers caused by poor blood circulation.
Wound healing. Early research shows that applying calendula ointment along with routine care does not improve the healing of surgical cut of the vagina made during childbirth.
Cancer.
Fever.
Hemorrhoids.
Muscle spasms.
Nosebleeds.
Promoting menstruation.
Treating mouth and throat soreness.
Varicose veins.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of calendula for these uses.",It is thought that the chemicals in calendula help new tissue grow in wounds and decrease swelling in the mouth and throat.,"Preparations of calendula flower are LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth or applied to the skin.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Don’t take calendula by mouth if you are pregnant. It is LIKELY UNSAFE. There is a concern that it might cause a miscarriage. It’s best to avoid topical use as well until more is known.

There is not enough reliable information about the safety of using calendula if you are breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to ragweed and related plants: Calendula may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking calendula.
Surgery: Calendula might cause too much drowsiness if combined with medications used during and after surgery. Stop taking calendula at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/235.html,"Tavassoli M, Shayeghi M, Abai M, et al.

21,Cannabidiol (CBD),"2-[(1R,6R)-3-Methyl-6-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl]-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol, CBD.","
Cannabidiol is a chemical in the Cannabis sativa plant, also known as marijuana or hemp. Over 80 chemicals, known as cannabinoids, have been identified in the Cannabis sativa plant. While delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the major active ingredient in marijuana, cannabidiol is also obtained from hemp, which contains only very small amounts of THC. 

The passage of the 2018 Farm Bill made it legal to sell hemp and hemp products in the U.S. But that doesn't mean that all hemp-derived cannabidiol products are legal. Since cannabidiol has been studied as a new drug, it can't be legally included in foods or dietary supplements. Also, cannabidiol can't be included in products marketed with therapeutic claims. Cannabidiol can only be included in ""cosmetic"" products and only if it contains less than 0.3% THC. But there are still products labeled as dietary supplements on the market that contain cannabidiol. The amount of cannabidiol contained in these products is not always reported accurately on the product label.

Cannabidiol is most commonly used for seizure disorder (epilepsy). It is also used for anxiety, pain, a muscle disorder called dystonia, Parkinson disease, Crohn disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CANNABIDIOL (CBD) are as follows:Likely effective for...
Seizure disorder (epilepsy). A specific cannabidiol product (Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals) has been shown to reduce seizures in adults and children with various conditions that are linked with seizures. This product is a prescription drug for treating seizures caused by Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It has also been shown to reduce seizures in people with tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge-Weber syndrome, febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), and specific genetic disorders that cause epileptic encephalopathy. But it's not approved for treating these other types of seizures.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Bipolar disorder. Early reports show that taking cannabidiol does not improve manic episodes in people with bipolar disorders. 
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease). Early research shows that taking cannabidiol does not reduce disease activity in adults with Crohn disease.
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking cannabidiol does not improve blood glucose levels, blood insulin levels, or HbA1c in adults with type 2 diabetes.
A movement disorder marked by involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia). Early research suggests that taking cannabidiol daily for 6 weeks might improve dystonia by 20% to 50% in some people. Higher quality research is needed to confirm this.
A condition in which a transplant attacks the body (graft-versus-host disease or GVHD). Graft-versus-host disease is a complication that can occur after a bone marrow transplant. In people with this condition, donor cells attack the person's own cells. Early research shows that taking cannabidiol daily starting 7 days before bone marrow transplant and continuing for 30 days after transplant can extend the time it takes for a person to develop GVHD.
An inherited brain disorder that affects movements, emotions, and thinking (Huntington disease). Early research shows that taking cannabidiol daily does not improve symptoms of Huntington's disease.
Insomnia. Early research suggests that taking 160 mg of cannabidiol  before bed improves sleep time in people with insomnia. However, lower doses do not have this effect. Cannabidiol also does not seem to help people fall asleep and might reduce the ability to recall dreams.
Multiple sclerosis (MS). There is inconsistent evidence on the effectiveness of cannabidiol for symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Some early research suggests that using a cannabidiol spray under the tongue might improve pain and muscle tightness in people with MS. However, it does not appear to improve muscle spasms, tiredness, bladder control, the ability to move around, or well-being and quality of life.
Withdrawal from heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs. Early research shows that taking cannabidiol for 3 days reduces cravings and anxiety in people with heroin use disorder that are not using heroin or any other opioid drugs. 
Parkinson disease. Some early research shows that taking cannabidiol daily for 4 weeks improves psychotic symptoms in people with Parkinson disease and psychosis.
Schizophrenia. Research on the use of cannabidiol for psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia is conflicting. Some early research suggests that taking cannabidiol four times daily for 4 weeks improves psychotic symptoms and might be as effective as the antipsychotic medication amisulpride. However, other early research suggests that taking cannabidiol for 14 days is not beneficial. The conflicting results might be related to the cannabidiol dose used and duration of treatment.
Quitting smoking. Early research suggests that inhaling cannabidiol with an inhaler for one week might reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by about 40% compared to baseline.
A type of anxiety marked by fear in some or all social settings (social anxiety disorder). Some early research shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily does not improve anxiety during public speaking in people with social anxiety disorder. However, other early research in people with social anxiety disorder suggests that taking a higher dose (400-600 mg) may improve anxiety associated with public speaking or medical imaging testing. Also, some research in people who do not have social anxiety disorder shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg might reduce anxiety during public speaking.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of cannabidiol for these uses.","Cannabidiol has antipsychotic effects. The exact cause for these effects is not clear. However, cannabidiol seems to prevent the breakdown of a chemical in the brain that affects pain, mood, and mental function. Preventing the breakdown of this chemical and increasing its levels in the blood seems to reduce psychotic symptoms associated with conditions such as schizophrenia. Cannabidiol might also block some of the psychoactive effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Also, cannabidiol seems to reduce pain and anxiety.","When taken by mouth: Cannabidiol is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth or sprayed under the tongue appropriately. Cannabidiol in doses of up to 300 mg daily have been taken by mouth safely for up to 6 months. Higher doses of 1200-1500 mg daily have been taken by mouth safely for up to 4 weeks. A prescription cannabidiol product (Epidiolex) is approved to be taken by mouth in doses of up to 10-20 mg/kg daily. Cannabidiol sprays that are applied under the tongue have been used in doses of 2.5 mg for up to 2 weeks.

Some reported side effects of cannabidiol include dry mouth, low blood pressure, light headedness, and drowsiness. Signs of liver injury have also been reported in some patients, but this is less common.
When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if cannabidiol is safe or what the side effects might be.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking cannabidiol if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: A prescription cannabidiol product (Epidiolex) is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth daily. The most common dose used is 10 mg/kg daily. Higher doses of 15-20 mg/kg daily may be used in some children, but these higher doses are more likely to cause side effects. This product is approved for use in certain children 2 years of age and older, but has been used in children as young as 1 year of age. 
Parkinson disease: Some early research suggests that taking high doses of cannabidiol might make muscle movement and tremors worse in people with Parkinson disease.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1439.html,"Product information for Marinol.

Capsicum, also known as red pepper or chili pepper, is an herb. The fruit of the capsicum plant is used to make medicine.


Capsicum is most commonly used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, and other painful conditions. It is also used for digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses. 

A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CAPSICUM are as follows:Likely effective for...
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Some research shows that applying a cream or using a skin patch containing capsaicin, the active chemical found in capsicum, reduces pain in people with nerve damage caused by diabetes. A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.) that is available by prescription only has also been studied. But this patch is not specifically approved for treating this type of nerve pain. Creams or gels that contain less capsaicin don't seem to work.
Pain. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, jaw pain, psoriasis, and other conditions.
Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia). Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum reduces pain over 24 hours by 27% to 37% in people with nerve damage caused by shingles. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only and must be applied by a health care provider.

Possibly effective for...
Back pain. Some research shows that applying a plaster that contains capsicum to the back can reduce low back pain.
Cluster headache. Some research shows that applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose reduces the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's best to apply capsicum to the nostril that is on the same side of the head as the headache.
Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (perennial rhinitis). Research shows that applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people without allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months.
Nausea and vomiting after surgery. Research shows that applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm 30 minutes before anesthesia and leaving it in place for 6-8 hour daily for up to 3 days after surgery reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Pain after surgery. Research shows that applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm 30 minutes before anesthesia and leaving it in place for 6-8 hour daily for up to 3 days after surgery reduces the need for painkillers within the first 24 hours after surgery. Other research shows that applying a specific patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.) one time can reduce pain for up to 12 weeks. However, it is not clear if this is due to a placebo effect. This product is available by prescription only.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Athletic performance. Research shows that taking a supplement containing capsicum and other ingredients before exercise does not improve exercise performance in men.
Hay fever. Early research suggests that inserting cotton wads in the nose that have been soaked in the capsicum active chemical capsaicin for 15 minutes and repeated over two days might reduce hay fever symptoms. But there is conflicting evidence that this might not improve symptoms. 
Burning pain in the mouth. Early research shows that using a mouth rinse containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, daily for 7 days slightly decreases burning discomfort in people with burning mouth syndrome. Other early research shows that applying a gel to the tongue three times daily for 14 days might slightly decrease pain in people with burning mouth syndrome. 
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking capsicum daily for 1 month can lower blood sugar levels after eating in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. But taking capsicum does not lower fasting blood sugar levels.
Indigestion (dyspepsia). Early research suggests that red pepper powder (containing capsicum) in capsules taken 3 times daily before meals reduces symptoms of heartburn. But in some people, symptoms get worse before they get better.
Fibromyalgia. Applying a cream containing 0.025% to 0.075% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, 4 times daily to tender points might reduce tenderness in people with fibromyalgia. However, it doesn't seem to reduce overall pain or improve physical function.
Nerve damage in the hands and feet of people with HIV/AIDS. Some research suggest that applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin for 30-90 minutes reduce pain for up to 12 weeks in people with nerve damage caused by HIV. But other research suggests it might not provide any benefits. Applying cream containing 0.075% capsaicin does not seem to work.
A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Early research shows that capsicum fruit taken by mouth does not help symptoms of IBS.
Joint pain. Early research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product containing capsaicin, the active ingredient in capsicum, and many other ingredients (Instaflex Joint Support) daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain by about 21% compared to placebo. The effects of capsicum alone cannot be determined from this study. 
Migraine. Some reports suggest that using the active chemical in capsicum in the nose might help migraine headaches.
Morton's neuroma. Some research shows that injecting capsicum into the foot one time might slightly reduce pain and decrease how much that pain interferes with walking and a person's mood. But capsicum only relieves pain in the first and fourth week after injection. 
A condition that causes persistent muscle pain (myofascial pain syndrome). Early research shows that using a specific cream (Dipental Cream) that contains capsaicin, an active chemical in capsicum, in addition to a ketoprofen patch does not further relieve pain in people with muscular pain in the upper back.
Obesity. Some research shows that taking capsules containing capsicum twice daily 30 minutes before eating for 12 weeks reduces stomach fat but not weight in overweight and obese people. But other research shows that taking a combination supplement containing capsicum extract twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference when used along with a diet.
Stomach ulcers. People who eat capsicum fruit (chili) an average of 24 times per month appear to be less likely to have an ulcer than people who eat chili an average of 8 times per month. This applies to chili in the form of chili powder, chili sauce, curry powder, and other chili-containing foods. But there is other evidence that suggests eating chili peppers does not help heal ulcers.
Nerve damage in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Early clinical research shows that applying a specific patch containing 8% capsaicin one time can reduce pain for up to 12 weeks in people with nerve pain from cancer and nerve pain in the back. However, it is not clear if this is due to a placebo effect. This product is available by prescription only.
A skin condition that causes extremely itchy, hard lumps to form on skin (prurigo nodularis). Applying a cream containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, 4-6 times daily seems to relieve burning sensations, itching and other symptoms. But it may take 22 weeks to 33 months of treatment to see a benefit, and symptoms may return after stopping use cream.
Polyps in the nose and sinus (sinonasal polyposis). Early research shows that putting capsicum in the nose improves symptoms and airflow in people with polyps.
Trouble swallowing. Some people, especially elderly people or those who have suffered a stroke, are more likely than other people to develop ""aspiration pneumonia."" This is a kind of pneumonia that develops after food or saliva is sucked into the airways because the person couldn't swallow properly. There is some evidence that dissolving a capsaicin-containing lozenge in the mouth of elderly people with swallowing problems before each meal can improve their ability to swallow.
Alcohol use disorder.
Diarrhea.
Gas (flatulence).
Heart disease.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia).
Malaria.
Motion sickness.
Osteoarthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Swelling (inflammation) of the voice box (laryngitis).
Toothache.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of capsicum for these uses.",The fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin seems to reduce pain sensations when applied to the skin. It might also reduce swelling.,"When taken by mouth: Capsicum is LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts typically found in food. Capsicum is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth as medicine, short-term, Side effects can include stomach irritation and upset, sweating, flushing, and runny nose. Capsicum is POSSIBLY UNSAFE to take by mouth in large doses or for long periods of time. In rare cases, this can lead to more serious side effects like liver or kidney damage, as well as severe spikes in blood pressure.
When applied to the skin: Medicinal lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are also LIKELY SAFE for most adults when applied to the skin. The active chemical in capsicum, capsaicin, is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation, burning, and itching. Capsicum can also be extremely irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or around the eyes.
When used in the nose: Capsicum is POSSIBLY SAFE  when used in the nose. No serious side effects have been reported, but application in the nose can be very painful. Nasal application can cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose. These side effects tend to decrease and go away after 5 or more days of repeated use.


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Capsicum is LIKELY SAFE when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth as a medicine, short-term during the second half of the second trimester, as well as the third trimester. 

If you are breast-feeding, using capsicum on your skin is LIKELY SAFE. But it is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for your baby if you take capsicum by mouth. Skin problems (dermatitis) have been reported in breast-fed infants when mothers eat foods heavily spiced with capsicum peppers.
Children: Applying capsicum to the skin of children under two years of age is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Not enough is known about the safety of giving capsicum to children by mouth. Don't do it.
Bleeding disorders: While conflicting results exist, capsicum might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Damaged skin: Don't use capsicum on damaged or broken skin.
Diabetes: In theory, capsicum might affect blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Until more is known, monitor your blood sugar closely if you take capsicum. The dose of your diabetes medication might need to be changed.
High blood pressure: Taking capsicum or eating a large amount of chili peppers might cause a spike in blood pressure. In theory, this might worsen the condition for people who already have high blood pressure.
Surgery: Capsicum might increase bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using capsicum at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/945.html,"de Freitas MC, Cholewa JM, Freire RV, et al.

Cascara sagrada is a shrub. The dried bark is used to make medicine.

Cascara sagrada used to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for constipation. However, over the years, concerns were raised about cascara sagrada’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA gave manufacturers the chance to submit safety and effectiveness information to answer these concerns. But the companies decided the cost of conducting safety and effectiveness studies would likely be more than the profit they could expect from sales of cascara sagrada. So they didn’t comply with the request. As a result, the FDA notified manufacturers to remove or reformulate all OTC laxative products containing cascara sagrada from the U.S. market by November 5, 2002. Today, you can buy cascara sagrada as a “dietary supplement,” but not as a drug. “Dietary supplements” don’t have to meet the standards that the FDA applies to OTC or prescription drugs.

Cascara sagrada is commonly used by mouth as a laxative for constipation.

In foods and beverages, a bitterless extract of cascara sagrada is sometimes used as a flavoring agent.

In manufacturing, cascara sagrada is used in the processing of some sunscreens.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CASCARA SAGRADA are as follows:Possibly effective for...Constipation. Cascara sagrada has laxative effects and may help relieve constipation in some people. Possibly ineffective for...Bowel preparation before colonoscopy. Most research shows that taking cascara sagradaalong with magnesium sulfate or milk of magnesia does not improve bowel cleansing in people who are undergoing a colonoscopy.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Gallstones.
Liver disease.
Cancer.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of cascara for these uses.",Cascara sagrada contains chemicals that stimulate the bowel and have a laxative effect.,"Cascara sagrada is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth for less than one week. Side effects include stomach discomfort and cramps.

Cascara sagrada is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used long-term.  Don’t use cascara sagrada for longer than one or two weeks. Long-term use can cause more serious side effects including dehydration; low levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, and other “electrolytes” in the blood; heart problems; muscle weakness; and others.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of cascara sagrada during pregnancy. Stay on the safe side and avoid use if you are pregnant. Cascara sagrada is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth while breast-feeding. Cascara sagrada can cross into breast milk and might cause diarrhea in a nursing infant.
Children: Cascara sagrada is POSSIBLY UNSAFE in children when taken by mouth. Don’t give cascara sagrada to children. They are more likely than adults to become dehydrated and also harmed by the loss of electrolytes, especially potassium.
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as intestinal obstruction, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, stomach ulcers, or unexplained stomach pain: People with any of these conditions should not use cascara sagrada.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/773.html,"Cirillo C, Capasso R.

Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical that is normally found in cartilage around joints in the body. Chondroitin sulfate is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage.

Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts. It is often used in combination with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, or glucosamine.
 
Chondroitin sulfate is also taken by mouth, applied to the skin, and given as a shot for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CHONDROITIN SULFATE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Cataracts. Research shows that injecting a solution that contains chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate into the eye protects the eye during cataract surgery. Many different products containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate have been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use during cataract surgery. However, it's not clear if adding chondroitin sulfate to sodium hyaluronate solutions helps reduce pressure within the eye after cataract surgery compared to other similar treatments. Some early studies suggest that a specific eye solution containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronate (Viscoat, Alcon Laboratories) can decrease pressure in the eye and improve overall eye health after a cataract is removed. However, the drops do not appear to be better than drops containing hyaluronate alone or another chemical called hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose. The effect of solutions containing only chondroitin sulfate on cataract surgery is not known.
Osteoarthritis. Clinical research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth modestly improves pain and function in some people with osteoarthritis when used for up to 6 months. It seems to work best in people with more severe pain and when a pharmaceutical-grade preparation is used. Specific products that have shown benefit in patients with osteoarthritis include Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA), Chondrosan (Bioibérica, S.A.), and Structrum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre). But pain relief is likely to be small at best. Other research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate for up to 2 years might slow the progression of osteoarthritis.

Some research has evaluated the effects of chondroitin sulfate when taken by mouth in combination with glucosamine. Some research shows that taking specific products containing chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine helps reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis. Other research shows no benefit when non-commercial preparations are used. Taking chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine long-term appears to slow the progression of osteoarthritis. 

There is some evidence that a skin cream containing chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor can reduce osteoarthritis symptoms. However, any symptom relief is most likely due to the camphor and not the other ingredients. There is no research showing that chondroitin is absorbed through the skin.


Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Joint pain caused by drugs called aromatase inhibitors (aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias). Early research suggests that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in two or three divided doses daily for 24 weeks improves joint pain and symptoms caused by drugs used to treat breast cancer.
Dry eye. Early research shows that using chondroitin sulfate eye drops can decrease dry eyes. Other research shows that using eye drops containing chondroitin sulfate and xanthan gum can improve dry eyes about as well as using artificial tears. But other early research shows no benefit.
Muscle soreness caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate daily does not reduce muscle soreness after exercise in men.
Persistent heartburn. When taken along with conventional treatments such as antacids, a syrup containing hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate might reduce the intensity of acid reflux symptoms.
Swelling (inflammation) of the stomach (gastritis). Early research shows that drinking a specific liquid containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid can decrease abdominal pain in people with gastritis.
Painful bladder syndrome (interstitial cystitis). Some research shows that putting liquid with chondroitin sulfate into the bladder can improve painful bladder symptoms. But most of these studies are low quality. Some higher-quality studies suggest that using chondroitin sulfate inside the bladder is not beneficial. Some early research shows that taking a product containing chondroitin sulfate and other ingredients by mouth can improve painful bladder. But it's not clear if the benefit is from chondroitin sulfate or the other ingredients.
A disorder that affects the bones and joints, ususally in people with selenium deficiency (Kashin-Beck disease). Early research suggests that chondroitin sulfate, with or without glucosamine hydrochloride, can reduce pain in people with Kashin-Beck disease. Also, taking chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine sulfate can slow joint space narrowing in people with this bone disease. However, it is unclear if taking chondroitin sulfate alone slows joint space narrowing.
Heart attack. Some early research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth might lower the risk of having a first or recurrent heart attack.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Early research suggests that taking chondroitin sulfate for 2-3 months decreases pain and improves skin conditions in people with psoriasis. But other research suggests that taking chondroitin sulfate (Condrosan, CS Bio-Active, Bioiberica S.A., Barcelona, Spain) daily for 3 months does not reduce psoriasis severity in people with psoriasis and knee osteoarthritis.
Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence). Early research suggests that inserting sodium chondroitin sulfate into the bladder through a urinary catheter improves quality of life in people with overactive bladder.
Infections of the kidney, bladder, or urethra (urinary tract infections or UTIs). Early research shows that administering a solution containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid into the bladder through a catheter reduces the number of UTIs in women with a history of UTIs. 
Heart disease.
Weak bones (osteoporosis).
High cholesterol.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate chondroitin sulfate for these uses. 
","In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down. Taking chondroitin sulfate, one of the building blocks of cartilage, might slow this breakdown.","When taken by mouth: Chondroitin sulfate is LIKELY SAFE. Chondroitin sulfate has been taken by mouth safely for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea. Other side effects that have been reported are bloating, diarrhea, constipation, headache, swollen eyelids, leg swelling, hair loss, skin rash, and irregular heartbeat.
When applied to the skin: Chondroitin sulfate is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor for up to 8 weeks.
When placed into the eye: Chondroitin sulfate is LIKELY SAFE when used as an eye solution during cataract surgery.
When given as a shot: Chondroitin sulfate is POSSIBLY SAFE when injected into the muscle as a shot, short-term.

There is some concern about the safety of chondroitin sulfate because it comes from animal sources. Some people are worried that unsafe manufacturing practices might lead to contamination of chondroitin products with diseased animal tissues, including those that might transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). So far, there are no reports of chondroitin causing disease in humans, and the risk is thought to be low. 

Some chondroitin products contain excess amounts of manganese. Ask your healthcare professional about reliable brands.
 

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Asthma: There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously.
Blood clotting disorders: In theory, administering chondroitin sulfate might increase the risk of bleeding in people with blood clotting disorders.
Prostate cancer: Early research suggests that chondroitin might cause the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer. This effect has not been shown with chondroitin sulfate supplements. However, until more is known, do not take chondroitin sulfate if you have prostate cancer or are at high risk for developing it (you have a brother or father with prostate cancer).",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/744.html,"Goddard JC, Janssen DAW.

Clove is a plant grown in parts of Asia and South America. People use the oils, dried flower buds, leaves, and stems to make medicine.

Clove is most commonly applied directly to the gums for toothache, pain control during dental work, and other dental-related issues. But there is limited scientific research to support these and other uses.

In foods and beverages, clove is used as a flavoring.

In manufacturing, clove is used in toothpaste, soaps, cosmetics, perfumes, and cigarettes. Clove cigarettes, also called kreteks, generally contain 60% to 80% tobacco and 20% to 40% ground clove. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CLOVE are as follows:Possibly effective for...Premature ejaculation. Research shows that applying a cream containing clove flower plus Panax ginseng root, Angelica root, Cistanches deserticola, Zanthoxyl species, Torlidis seed, Asiasari root, cinnamon bark, and toad venom (SS Cream) to the skin of the penis improves premature (early) ejaculation.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Anal tears. Early research shows that applying a clove oil cream to anal tears for 6 weeks improves healing compared to using stool softeners and applying lidocaine cream.
Dental plaque. Early research shows that using a toothpaste or mouth rinse containing clove and other ingredients helps to reduce plaque on the teeth. 
Mosquito repellent. Early research shows that applying clove oil or clove oil gel directly to the skin can repel mosquitos for up to 5 hours.
Pain. Early research shows that applying a gel containing ground cloves for 5 minutes before being stuck with a needle can reduce needle stick pain.
Itching. Early research shows that putting a solution containing clove oil gel on the skin can help with severe itching.
Toothache. Clove oil and eugenol, one of the chemicals it contains, have long been applied to the teeth and gums for toothache, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reclassified eugenol, downgrading its effectiveness rating. The FDA now believes there is not enough evidence to rate eugenol as effective for toothache pain.
""Dry socket"" following tooth extraction.
Vomiting.
Upset stomach.
Nausea.
Gas (flatulence).
Diarrhea.
Hernia.
Pain and swelling (inflammation) of the mouth and throat.
Cough.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of clove for these uses.","Clove oil contains a chemical called eugenol that may help to decrease pain and fight infections, but more research is needed.","Clove is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth in amounts commonly found in food. Not enough is known about the safety of taking clove by mouth in larger medicinal amounts. 

Clove oil or cream containing clove flower is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied directly to the skin. However, application of clove oil in the mouth or on the gums can sometimes cause damage to the gums, tooth pulp, skin, and mucous membranes.

Inhaling smoke from clove cigarettes or injecting clove oil into the veins is LIKELY UNSAFE and can cause side effects such as breathing problems and lung disease.

Dried clove can also cause mouth sensitivity and irritation, as well as damage to dental tissues.
Special precautions & warnings:
Children: In children, clove oil is LIKELY UNSAFE to take by mouth. It can cause severe side effects such as seizures, liver damage, and fluid imbalances.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Clove is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in amounts commonly found in food. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking clove in medicinal doses if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Bleeding disorders: Clove oil contains a chemical called eugenol that seems to slow blood clotting. There is a concern that taking clove oil might cause bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Surgery: Clove oil contains a chemical called eugenol that seems to slow blood clotting. There is a concern that it might cause bleeding during or after surgery. Stop using clove at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/251.html,"Jiang Q, Wu Y, Zhang H, et al.

","
Coconut oil comes from the nut (fruit) of the coconut palm. The oil of the nut is used to make medicine. Some coconut oil products are referred to as ""virgin"" coconut oil. Unlike olive oil, there is no industry standard for the meaning of ""virgin"" coconut oil. The term has come to mean that the oil is generally unprocessed. For example, virgin coconut oil usually has not been bleached, deodorized, or refined.

Some coconut oil products claim to be ""cold pressed"" coconut oil. This generally means that a mechanical method of pressing out the oil is used, but without the use of any outside heat source. The high pressure needed to press out the oil generates some heat naturally, but the temperature is controlled so that temperatures do not exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

People use coconut oil by mouth for diabetes, heart disease, chronic fatigue, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Alzheimer's disease, diarrhea, quality of life in people with breast cancer, thyroid conditions, energy, and boosting the immune system. Despite coconut oil's high calorie and saturated fat content, some people use it by mouth to lose weight and lower cholesterol.

Coconut oil is sometimes applied to the skin as a moisturizer, for neonatal health, and to treat eczema (atopic dermatitis) and a skin condition called psoriasis. Coconut oil is also used for lice and in hair products to prevent hair damage.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for COCONUT OIL are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Applying coconut oil to the skin can reduce the severity of eczema in children by about 30% more than mineral oil.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Breast cancer. Early research suggests that taking virgin coconut oil by mouth daily starting one week after chemotherapy from the 3rd to the 6th cycle improves quality of life in some but not all measurements in women with advanced breast cancer.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that taking coconut or coconut oil does not seem to increase or decrease the risk of heart attack or chest pain.
Diarrhea. One study in children found that incorporating coconut oil into the diet can reduce the length of diarrhea, but another study found that it was no more effective than a cow milk-based diet. The effect of coconut oil alone is not clear.
Dry skin. Early research shows that applying coconut oil to the skin twice daily can improve skin moisture in people with dry skin.
Death of an unborn or premature baby. Early research suggest that applying coconut oil to babies' skin daily for 28 days reduces the risk of infection in premature babies. But it doesn't reduce the risk of death.
Lice. Developing research shows that a spray containing coconut oil, anise oil, and ylang ylang oil appears to be effective for treating head lice in children. It seems to work about as well as a spray containing chemical insecticides.
Obesity. Some research shows that taking coconut oil by mouth for 8 weeks along with diet and exercise leads to notable weight loss in more obese women compared to taking soybean oil or chia oil. Other early research shows that taking coconut oil for one week can reduce waist size compared to soybean oil in women with excessive fat around the stomach and abdomen. But there is some limited evidence that taking coconut oil for 4 weeks reduces waist size compared to baseline in only obese men but not women.
Growth and development in premature infants. Premature infants have immature skin. This might increase their chance of getting an infection. Some research shows that applying coconut oil to the skin of very premature infants improves the strength of their skin. But it's not known if this reduces their chance of getting an infection. Other research shows that massaging premature newborns with coconut oil can improve weight gain and growth.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Applying coconut oil to the skin before treatment of psoriasis with ultraviolet B (UVB) or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) light therapy doesn't seem to improve effectiveness of the treatment.
Alzheimer's disease.
Chronic fatigue.
Crohn's disease.
Diabetes.
Irritable bowel syndrome.
Thyroid conditions.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate coconut oil for these uses.
","Coconut oil contains a certain kind of fat known as ""medium chain triglycerides."" Some of these fats work differently than other types of saturated fat in the body. When applied to the skin, coconut oil has a moisturizing effect.","When taken by mouth: Coconut oil is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in food amounts. But coconut oil contains a type of fat that can increase cholesterol levels. So people should avoid eating coconut oil in excess. Coconut oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when used as a medicine short-term. Taking coconut oil in doses of 10 mL two or three times daily for up to 12 weeks seems to be safe.
When applied to the skin: Coconut oil is LIKELY SAFE when applied to the skin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut oil is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: Coconut oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin for about one month. There's not enough reliable information to know if coconut oil is safe for children when taken by mouth as a medicine.
High cholesterol: Coconut oil contains a type of fat that can increase cholesterol levels. Regularly eating meals containing coconut oil can increase levels of ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This might be a problem for people who already have high cholesterol.

Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts. As the coconut matures, the water is replaced by coconut meat. Coconut water is sometimes referred to as green coconut water because the immature coconuts are green in color.

Coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is produced from an emulsion of the grated meat of a mature coconut.

Coconut water is commonly used as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. It is also tried for high blood pressure and to improve exercise performance.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for COCONUT WATER are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Diarrhea-related dehydration. Some research shows that consuming coconut water can help prevent dehydration in children with mild diarrhea. But there is no reliable evidence that it is any more effective than other beverages for this use.
Dehydration caused by exercise. Some athletes use coconut water to replace fluids after exercise. Coconut water helps people rehydrate after exercise, but it does not appear to be more effective than sports drinks or plain water. Some athletes also use coconut water before exercise to prevent dehydration. Coconut water might work better than drinking plain water, but results are still preliminary.
Exercise performance. Some athletes use coconut water to replace fluids during or after exercise in order to improve their performance during follow-up exercise. Coconut water might help, but it does not appear to be more effective than sports drinks or plain water. Some athletes also use coconut water before exercise to improve endurance. Coconut water might work better than drinking plain water, but results are still preliminary.
High blood pressure. Some research suggests that drinking coconut water might lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of coconut water for these uses.","Coconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Because of this electrolyte composition, there is a lot of interest in using coconut water to treat and prevent dehydration. But some experts suggest that the electrolyte composition in coconut water is not adequate to be used as a rehydration solution.","Coconut water is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when consumed as a drink. It might cause fullness or stomach upset in some people. But this is uncommon. In large amounts, coconut water might cause potassium levels in the blood to become too high. This might lead to kidney problems and irregular heartbeat. 

Coconut water is POSSIBLY SAFE for children.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of coconut water during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis can lower salt levels in the body. Some people with cystic fibrosis need to take fluids or pills to increase salt levels, especially sodium. Coconut water is not a good fluid to take to increase salt levels in people with cystic fibrosis. Coconut water might contain too little sodium and too much potassium. Don't drink coconut water as way to increase salt levels if you have cystic fibrosis.
High levels of potassium in the blood: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Don't drink coconut water if you have high levels of potassium in the blood. 
Low blood pressure: Coconut water might lower blood pressure. Discuss your use of coconut water with your healthcare provider if you have blood pressure problems.
Kidney problems: Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Normally, potassium is excreted in the urine if blood levels get too high. However, this doesn't happen if kidneys are not working normally. Discuss your use of coconut water with your healthcare provider if you have kidney problems.
Surgery: Coconut water might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop using coconut water at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1261.html,"Hakimian J, Goldbarg SH, Park CH, Kerwin TC. Death by coconut.

Cod liver oil can be obtained from eating fresh cod liver or by taking supplements.

Cod liver oil is used as a source of vitamin A and vitamin D, and to treat high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, kidney disease in people with diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, an autoimmune disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glaucoma, and middle ear infections (otitis media). It is also used to prevent respiratory infections, and an age-related eye condition called macular degeneration.

Some people put cod liver oil on their skin to speed healing of wounds, burns, and rashes.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for COD LIVER OIL are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Age-related macular degeneration. People who eat a lot of fish and take cod liver oil don't have a lower risk of developing this condition compared to people who just eat a lot of fish.
Irregular heartbeat. Taking cod liver oil by mouth might reduce a specific type of irregular heartbeat in some people. But it's not known if this reduces the risk of heart-related death. Taking cod liver oil by mouth does not seem to reduce irregular heartbeat in men with irregular heartbeat after a heart attack. 
Depression. Taking cod liver oil has been linked with a 29% lower chance of older adults having depression symptoms.
High cholesterol levels in the blood. Taking cod liver oil by mouth doesn't lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. But it might increase ""good"" high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in people with type 1 diabetes and high cholesterol. Also it might lower blood fats called ""triglycerides"" in men who have had a heart attack. But cod liver oil doesn't improve these outcomes in people with an inherited form of high cholesterol.
High blood pressure. Taking cod liver oil by mouth seems to slightly lower blood pressure in healthy people and those with slightly high blood pressure. But it's not clear if this reduction is clinically meaningful for people with very high cholesterol.
Inflammatory bowel disease. Some people with inflammatory bowel disease have joint pain. Taking cod liver oil might reduce joint pain in some people with this condition.
Osteoarthritis. Taking cod liver oil along with an NSAID doesn't reduce swelling in people with osteoarthritis better than taking an NSAID alone.
Ear infections in young children. Taking cod liver oil and a multivitamin might reduce the need to use medicine to treat ear infections in young children by about 12%.
Airway infections. Giving young children cod liver oil and a multivitamin seems to reduce the number of doctor's office visits for airway infections.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Taking cod liver oil might decrease pain, morning stiffness, and swelling in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Also, taking cod liver oil and fish oil seems to reduce the need to use medicine to treat joint swelling in people with this condition. 
Vitamin D deficiency. Taking cod liver oil seems to increase blood levels of vitamin D in some people. But it's not clear if cod liver oil increases vitamin D to normal levels in people with low levels of vitamin D.
Wound healing.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate cod liver oil for these uses.","Cod liver oil contains certain ""fatty acids"" that prevent the blood from clotting easily. These fatty acids also reduce pain and swelling.","Cod liver oil is LIKELY SAFE for most adults and children when taken by mouth. It can cause side effects including belching, bad breath, heartburn, loose stools, and nausea. Taking cod liver oil with meals can often decrease these side effects.

High doses of cod liver oil are POSSIBLY UNSAFE. They might keep blood from clotting and can increase the chance of bleeding. Vitamin A and vitamin D levels might also become too high with high doses of cod liver oil.

The safety of cod liver oil when used on the skin is unknown.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Cod liver oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when used in amounts that provide no more than the recommended daily intakes of vitamin A and vitamin D. Cod liver oil is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken in larger amounts. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should not take cod liver oil that provides more than about 3000 mcg of vitamin A and 100 mcg of vitamin D.
Diabetes: There has been some concern that cod liver oil or other fish oils might increase blood sugar in people with diabetes. But there is no strong research that supports this concern. High blood pressure: Cod liver oil can lower blood pressure and might cause blood pressure to go too low if used along with medications for high blood pressure.

Creatine is a chemical that is found in the body. It is found mostly in muscles but also in the brain. It is also found in foods such as red meat and seafood. Creatine can also be made in the laboratory.

Creatine is most commonly used for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass in athletes and older adults. There is some science supporting the use of creatine in improving the athletic performance of young, healthy people during brief high-intensity activity such as sprinting. Because of this, creatine is often used as a dietary supplement to improve muscle strength and athletic performance. In the U.S., a majority of sports nutrition supplements, which total $2.7 billion in annual sales, contain creatine.

Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and professional sports.

In addition to improving athletic performance and muscle strength, creatine is taken by mouth for creatine deficiency syndromes that affect the brain, aging, bone density, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), depression, diabetes, exercise tolerance, fibromyalgia, Huntington's disease, disease that cause inflammation in the muscles (idiopathic inflammatory myopathies), Parkinson's disease, diseases of the muscles and nerves, multiple sclerosis, muscle atrophy, muscle cramps, breathing problems in infants while sleeping, head trauma, Rett syndrome, an eye disease called gyrate atrophy, inherited disorders that affect the senses and movement, schizophrenia, muscle breakdown in the spine, and recovery from surgery. It is also taken by mouth to slow the worsening of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, McArdle's disease, and for various muscular dystrophies.

People apply creatine to the skin for aging skin.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for CREATINE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Age-related muscle loss. Creatine seems to improve muscle strength in older adults who are also performing resistance training compared to resistance training alone. But it doesn't seem to be beneficial when taken as a single dose or when used without resistance training.

Athletic performance. Creatine seems to help improve rowing performance, jumping height, and soccer performance in athletes. But the effect of creatine on sprinting, cycling, or swimming performance varies. The mixed results may relate to the small sizes of the studies, the differences in creatine doses, and differences in test used to measure performance. Creatine does not seem to improve serving ability in tennis players.
Syndromes caused by problems metabolizing creatine. Some people have a disorder that prevents their body from making creatine. This can lead to low levels of creatine in the brain. Low levels of creatine in the brain can lead to decreased mental function, seizures, autism, and movement problems. Taking creatine by mouth daily for up to 3 years can increase creatine levels in the brain in children and young adults with a disorder of creatine production called guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency. This can help improve movement and reduce seizures. But it doesn't improve mental ability. Arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency is another disorder that prevents the body from making creatine. In children with this condition, taking creatine for up to 8 years seems to improve attention, language, and mental performance. But taking creatine does not seem to improve brain creatine levels, movement, or mental function in children who have a disorder in which creatine isn't transported properly. 
Muscle strength. There is a lot of mixed research on creatine's ability to improve muscle strength. However, analyses of this research show that creatine seems to modestly improve upper body strength and lower body strength in both younger and older adults.
Possibly ineffective for...Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow disease progression or improve survival in people with ALS.
Inherited disease called Huntington's disease. Research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily for 2 years does not improve muscle strength, coordination, or symptoms in people with Huntington's disease.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Skin aging. Early research shows that applying cream containing creatine, guarana, and glycerol to the face daily for 6 weeks reduces wrinkles and skin sagging in men. Other research suggests that a cream containing creatine and folic acid reduces wrinkles and improves sun-damaged skin. 
Lung disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Early research on the effects of creatine in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is inconsistent. Some research suggests that taking creating daily does not improve lung function. However, other research suggests that taking creatine may improve lung function or exercise capacity. 
Heart failure. Some early research shows that taking creatine daily for 5-10 days improves muscle strength and endurance but does not improve symptoms of heart failure. Taking lower doses of creatine daily for 6 months does not improve exercise capacity or heart failure symptoms in men. 
Depression. Early research suggests that taking creatine daily for 8 weeks enhances the effects of the antidepressant drug escitalopram in women with major depressive disorder. 
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth for 5 days reduces blood sugar after eating in people with newly diagnosed diabetes. However, the effects of taking creatine for longer than 5 days in people with diabetes are not know. 
Fibromyalgia. Early research suggests that taking 5 grams of creatine four times daily for 5 days followed by 5 grams daily for 16 weeks improves strength in women with fibromyalgia. But creatine does not seem to improve aerobic exercise capacity, pain, sleep, quality of life, or mental function in people 
with fibromyalgia. 
Vision loss (gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina). Early research shows that creatine deficiency, which has been associated with this form of vision loss, can be corrected with supplements. Taking creatine daily for one year seems to slow eye damage and vision loss. 
Inherited nerve damage (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy). Early research in people with inherited nerve damage diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, suggest that taking creatine by mouth daily for between one and 12 weeks has no effect on muscle strength or endurance. 
Muscle diseases such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Early studies suggest taking creatine might produce small improvements in muscle strength in people with these conditions. 
Muscle disorder called McArdle disease. Some early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily improves muscle function in some people with McArdle disease. However, taking higher doses of creatine seem to make muscle pain worse. 
Muscular and neurological diseases called mitochondrial myopathies. Early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth does not improve muscle function or quality of life in people with mitochondrial myopathies. However, creatine might improve some measures of muscle strength. 
Multiple sclerosis. Early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily for 5 days does not improve exercise ability in people with multiple sclerosis. 
Loss of muscle tissue. Taking creatine by mouth daily does not seem to increase muscle mass or strength in men with muscle loss due to HIV. However, taking creatine seems to help maintain muscle mass and reduce the loss of muscle strength that is associated with having to wear a cast. 
Muscle cramps. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth before hemodialysis treatments seems to reduce muscle cramps. 
Muscular dystrophy. Early research on the use of creatine by mouth in people with muscular dystrophy is not clear. Some evidence shows that muscle strength and fatigue seem to improve after taking creatine daily for 8-16 weeks. However, other research suggests that creatine provides no benefit for people with muscular dystrophy. 
Breathing problems while sleeping in newborns. Early research shows that giving creatine to premature infants does not improve breathing problems while sleeping. 
Brain injury. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 7 days increases the ability to exercise by increasing lung function in people with a spinal cord injury. However, other research shows that creatine does not improve wrist muscle or hand function. Early research also shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 6 months reduces amnesia following a traumatic brain injury in children. 
Osteoarthritis. Early research suggests that taking creating by mouth daily in combination with strengthening exercises improves physical functioning in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis. 
Parkinson's disease. Early research suggests that taking creatine twice daily for 12-18 months slows the progression of Parkinson's disease in people who have not yet started conventional medicines. 
Nervous system disorder called Rett syndrome. Early research suggests that taking creating daily for 6 months can slightly improve symptoms in females with Rett syndrome. 
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily increases lean muscle mass and may improve muscle strength, but does not improve physical functioning in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In children, taking a specific supplement  containing creatine and fatty acids twice daily for 30 days might reduce pain and swelling. But the effects of creatine alone are not clear. 
Schizophrenia. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 2 months does not improve symptoms or mental function in people with schizophrenia. 
Muscle loss in the spine. Early research suggests that children with muscle loss in the spine do not benefit from taking creatine by mouth. 
Recovery from surgery. Early research shows that taking creatine daily does not speed up recovery of muscle strength after surgery. 
Bipolar disorder.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of creatine for these uses.

","Creatine is involved in making the energy muscles need to work.

Vegetarians and other people who have lower total creatine levels when they start taking creatine supplements seem to get more benefit than people who start with a higher level of creatine. Skeletal muscle will only hold a certain amount of creatine; adding more won't raise levels any more. This ""saturation point"" is usually reached within the first few days of taking a ""loading dose.""","Creatine  is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth at doses up to 25 grams daily for up to 14 days. Lower doses up to 4-5 grams taken daily for up to 18 months are also LIKELY SAFE. Some early research also suggests that creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken in doses up to 10 grams daily for up to 5 years. 

Creatine can cause stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle cramping.

Creatine causes muscles to draw water from the rest of your body. Be sure to drink extra water to make up for this. Also, if you are taking creatine, don't exercise in the heat. It might cause you to become dehydrated.

Many people who use creatine gain weight. This is because creatine causes the muscles to hold water, not because it actually builds muscle.

There is concern that creatine might cause irregular heartbeat in some people. But more information is needed to know if creatine can cause this problem.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking creatine if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: Creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE in children when taken by mouth appropriately. Creatine 3-5 grams daily for 2-6 months has been taken safely in children 5-18 years of age. Creatine 2 grams daily for 6 months has been taken safely in children 2-5 years of age. Additionally, creatine 0.1-0.4 grams/kg daily for up to 6 months has been taken safely in both infants and children.
Bipolar disorder: There have been cases of manic episodes in people with bipolar disorder who took creatine daily for 4 weeks. Creatine might make mania worse in people with bipolar disorder.
Kidney disease or diabetes: Do not use creatine if you have kidney disease or a disease such as diabetes that increases your chance of developing kidney disease. There is some concern that creatine might make kidney disease worse.
Parkinson's disease: Caffeine and creatine taken together may make Parkinson's disease get worse faster. If you have Parkinson's disease and take creatine, use caffeine with caution.

Devil's claw is an herb. The botanical name, Harpagophytum, means ""hook plant"" in Greek. This plant gets its name from the appearance of its fruit, which is covered with hooks meant to attach onto animals in order to spread the seeds. The roots and tubers of the plant are used to make medicine.

Devil's claw is used for ""hardening of the arteries"" (atherosclerosis), arthritis, gout, muscle pain (myalgia), back pain, fibromyalgia, tendonitis, chest pain, gastrointestinal (GI) upset or heart burn, fever, and migraine headache. It is also used for difficulties in childbirth, menstrual problems, allergic reactions, loss of appetite, and kidney and bladder disease.

Some people apply devil's claw to the skin for injuries and other skin conditions.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for DEVIL'S CLAW are as follows:Possibly effective for...Back pain. Taking devil's claw by mouth seems to reduce low-back pain. Devil's claw seems to work about as well as some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Osteoarthritis. Taking devil's claw alone or along with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to help decrease osteoarthritis-related pain. Some evidence suggests that devil's claw works about as well as diacerhein (a slow-acting drug for osteoarthritis that is not available in the U.S.) for improving osteoarthritis pain in the hip and knee after 16 weeks of treatment. Some people taking devil's claw seem to be able to lower the dose of NSAIDs they need for pain relief.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research suggests that taking devil's claw extract by mouth might not improve RA.
Gout.
High cholesterol.
Loss of appetite.
Muscle pain.
Migraine headache.
Skin injuries and conditions.
Upset stomach.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate devil's claw for these uses.",Devil's claw contains chemicals that might decrease inflammation and swelling and resulting pain.,"Devil's claw is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth in appropriate doses for up to a year. The most common side effect is diarrhea. About 8% of the people participating in one research study developed diarrhea. Other possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, headaches, ringing in the ears, loss of appetite, and loss of taste. It can also cause allergic skin reactions, menstrual problems, and changes in blood pressure. But these events are uncommon.

Not enough is known about the safety of using devil's claw long-term or applying it to the skin.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Devil's claw is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. It might harm the developing fetus. Avoid use in pregnancy. It is also best to avoid using devil's claw while breast-feeding. Not enough is known yet about its safety during breast-feeding.
Heart problems, high blood pressure, low blood pressure: Since devil's claw can affect heart rate, heartbeat, and blood pressure, it might harm people with disorders of the heart and circulatory system. If you have one of these conditions, talk with your healthcare provider before starting devil's claw.
Diabetes: Devil's claw might lower blood sugar levels. Using it along with medications that lower blood sugar might cause blood sugar to drop too low. Monitor blood glucose levels closely. Your healthcare provider might need to adjust your dose of diabetes medications.
Gallstones: Devil's claw might increase bile production. This could be a problem for people with gallstones. Avoid using devil's claw. 
Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): Since devil's claw might increase the production of stomach acids This might harm people with stomach ulcers.

DHEA is a hormone that is naturally made by the body. DHEA works in the body to make other male and female sex hormones within the body. 

People commonly use DHEA for slowing signs of aging, improve physical performance, and many other conditions, but there is not good scientific evidence to support these uses.

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for DHEA are as follows:Likely effective for...
Thinning vaginal tissue (vaginal atrophy). The walls of the vagina can become thinner after menopause. This can cause pain during sex. Using vaginal inserts containing DHEA can reduce pain during sex by up to 15% in women after menopause. A prescription DHEA product is available for this condition. 
Possibly effective for...
Aging skin. Some research shows that taking DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin might improve skin appearance in women after menopause and in people over the age of 60 years.  
Depression. Some research shows that taking 30-500 mg of DHEA by mouth daily improves symptoms of depression. Lower doses do not seem to help. Some experts recommend DHEA for depression if more common medications don't work. 
Infertility. Most research shows that taking DHEA for 2 to 3 months before in-vitro fertilization (IVF) might improve the chances of pregnancy and having a baby. However, other research shows that taking DHEA does not seem to prevent miscarriage in women that have had IVF. It isn't known if taking DHEA helps women get pregnant without IVF. 

Possibly ineffective for...
Aging. Taking DHEA daily for up to 2 years does not seem to improve body shape, bone strength, muscle strength, or quality of life in people older than 60 who have low DHEA levels. 
Physical performance. Most research shows that DHEA does not improve muscle strength in younger or older adults.  
Psoriasis. Early research suggests that DHEA given every week by injection does not improve symptoms of psoriasis in most people.  
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research suggests that taking DHEA does not reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in older people.  
Withdrawal symptoms from cocaine or heroin. Early research shows that taking DHEA does not seem to improve heroin or cocaine withdrawal symptoms in people who are addicted. 

Likely ineffective for...
 Mental function. Most research shows that taking DHEA by mouth does not seem to improve mental function or decrease mental decline in healthy older people, people with HIV, or in healthy young adults.
Sjögren's syndrome. Research shows that taking DHEA does not improve symptoms of a condition called Sjögren's syndrome that causes dry eyes and dry mouth.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Addison's disease. The effects of DHEA on the symptoms of Addison's disease are not clear. Some early research shows that taking DHEA might improve symptoms such as weight loss and bone density loss. Other research shows that taking DHEA does not improve most symptoms. But it might improve mood and feelings of tiredness. 
Adrenal hormone deficiency. The effects of DHEA in women who have symptoms related to a lack of adrenal hormone is not clear. Some research shows that DHEA might improve feelings of well-being and sexuality. Other research shows that DHEA provides no benefit. 
Improving growth and maturation in girls with hormone deficiency (atrichia pubis). Some early reports suggest that DHEA might help growth and maturation in girls with atrichia pubis.
Heart disease. It isn't known if taking DHEA can help prevent or treat heart disease. But people with heart disease and low levels of DHEA in the body seem to be at higher risk for things like a heart attack. 
Abnormal cell growth on the cervix (cervical dysplasia). Early research shows that DHEA given as a vaginal insert for 6 months removes abnormal cell growth on the cervix. 
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Early research shows that taking DHEA reduces symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. 
A lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Early research shows that taking DHEA might improve lung function and walking distance in people with COPD. 
Muscle damage from exercise. Early research shows that taking DHEA might improve muscle soreness in men completing an exercise program. 
Fibromyalgia. Early research shows that taking DHEA does not reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia. 
HIV/AIDS. Early studies show that taking DHEA might improve mood and quality of life in people with HIV. 
Diseases with inflammation of the bowels like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Early research shows that taking DHEA reduces symptoms in people with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. 
Menopausal symptoms. Early research shows that taking DHEA might reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women. Some research shows that using DHEA in the vagina might improve sexual function.
Metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that put people at high risk for heart disease). There is early evidence that DHEA might lower some of the health risks that put overweight men and women at risk for heart disease and diabetes. Taking DHEA might decrease weight, fat around the waist, and insulin levels. 
Inherited condition with many symptoms including muscle wasting (myotonic dystrophy). Taking DHEA does not seem to improve muscle strength in people with myotonic dystrophy. However, early research shows that DHEA given by injection might improve daily function, heart function, and muscle strength. 
Osteoporosis. Some research shows that taking DHEA by mouth daily might improve bone strength in older women and men with osteoporosis and in young women with an eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. However, other research shows that DHEA does not improve bone strength in postmenopausal women. 
Low androgen hormone in men. Early research shows that taking DHEA might improve mood, fatigue, and joint pain in older men with low androgen hormone levels. 
Childbirth. Research shows that giving DHEA at 37 or 38 weeks of pregnancy might shorten the time until labor starts and the time a woman is in labor. 
Schizophrenia. The effects of DHEA on the symptoms of schizophrenia are not clear. Some research shows that taking DHEA by mouth might improve schizophrenia symptoms, however other research shows it does not improve symptoms. DHEA may be more effective in women than men with schizophrenia. 
Sexual dysfunction. Taking DHEA seems to improve symptoms including erectile dysfunction and overall sexual satisfaction in men with some types of erectile dysfunction. However, it does not seem to be helpful if erectile dysfunction is caused by diabetes or nerve disorders. Also, DHEA does not seem to improve sexual dysfunction in men with low levels of the hormone androgen or in men and women with low sexual desire. Some research shows that taking DHEA by mouth might improve sexual function in women with decreased libido or those who are postmenopausal. In people with certain types of depression, taking DHEA might improve sexual function. 
Lupus. Some early research shows that DHEA does not improve symptoms of lupus. However, when used with usual treatments for lupus, DHEA might help reduce the number of disease flare-ups. 
Weight loss. Early research shows that DHEA does not seem to reduce weight in older people or people who are obese.
Breast cancer.
Diabetes.
Parkinson's disease.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate DHEA for these uses. ","DHEA is a ""hormone"" naturally made in the body by the adrenal glands near the kidneys and by the liver. DHEA helps to make male and female sex hormones within the body. 

DHEA levels seem to go down as people get older. DHEA levels seem to be lower in people with depression, postmenopausal women and many other conditions. 
","DHEA is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth, applied to the skin, and used inside the vagina appropriately. DHEA has been taken by mouth safely for up to 2 years. DHEA cream has been safely applied to the skin for up to 1 year. DHEA containing vaginal inserts have been safely used for up to 3 months. 

The most common side effects of DHEA are generally mild and can include acne and upset stomach. Acne occurs more in women taking DHEA. Some women can have changes in menstrual cycle, abnormal hair growth, and a deeper voice after taking DHEA. Breast pain or growth can occur in men taking DHEA. 

DHEA is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high doses or long-term. Do not use DHEA in doses higher than 50-100 mg a day or for a long period of time. Using higher doses or using for a long time period can increase the chance of potentially serious side effects.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: DHEA is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It can cause higher than normal levels of a male hormone called androgen. This might be harmful to the baby. Do not use DHEA if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Enlarged Prostate: DHEA might cause difficulty in urinating for people with an enlarged prostate, known as benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). 
Diabetes: DHEA can affect how insulin works in the body. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully if you are taking DHEA.
Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: DHEA is a hormone that can affect how estrogen works in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, do not use DHEA.
High cholesterol: DHEA might lower ""good cholesterol"". If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, talk with your healthcare provider before taking DHEA.
Liver problems: DHEA might make liver problems worse. Do not use DHEA if you have liver problems.
Depression and mood disorders: DHEA might cause excitability, impulsiveness, and irritability  in people with mood disorders. If you have a mood disorder, be sure to discuss DHEA with your healthcare provider before you start taking it. Also, pay close attention to any changes in how you feel.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Taking DHEA might make this condition worse. Don't use DHEA if you have PCOS.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of dong quai for these uses.",Dong quai root has been shown to affect estrogen and other hormones in animals. It is not known if these same effects happen in humans.,"Dong quai is POSSIBLY SAFE for adults when taken by mouth or when occasionally applied to the skin as a cream. More evidence is needed to determine its safety after prolonged or repeated use.

Dong quai can cause skin to become extra-sensitive to the sun. This might put you at greater risk for sunburn and skin cancer. Wear sun block outside, especially if you are light-skinned.

Taking dong quai in large amounts for a long period of time is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Dong quai contains chemicals that may cause cancer.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Taking dong quai by mouth during pregnancy or when breast-feeding is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for the baby. Dong quai seems to affect the muscles of the uterus. There is one report of a baby born with birth defects to a mother who took a product containing dong quai and other herbs during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Do not use dong quai if you are pregnant.

There is one report of a breast-fed baby who developed high blood pressure after his mother ate soup containing dong quai. Stay on the safe side and don't use it if you are breast-feeding.
Bleeding disorders. Dong quai might slow blood clotting and increase the chance of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Dong quai might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use dong quai.
Protein S deficiency: People with protein S deficiency have an increased risk of blood clots. Dong quai might increase the risk of blood clots in people with protein S deficiency. Don't use dong quai if you have protein S deficiency.
Surgery: Dong quai might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking dong quai at least 2 weeks before surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/936.html,"Fung FY, Wong WH, Ang SK, et al.

Eucalyptus is a tree. The dried leaves and oil are used to make medicine.


People use eucalyptus for many conditions including asthma, bronchitis, plaque and gingivitis, head lice, toe nail fungus, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. ","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for EUCALYPTUS are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Asthma. Early research shows that eucalyptol, a chemical found in eucalyptus oil, might be able to break up mucous in people with asthma. Some people with severe asthma have been able to lower their dosage of steroid medications if they take eucalyptol. But don't try this without your healthcare provider's advice and monitoring.
Bronchitis. Some research shows that taking a specific combination product containing eucalyptol, a chemical found in eucalyptus oil, and extracts of pine and lime by mouth for at least 2 weeks improves symptoms and reduces flare-ups in people with bronchitis.
Dental plaque. Early research shows that chewing gum containing 0.3% to 0.6% eucalyptus extract can reduce dental plaque in some people.
Gingivitis. Early research shows that chewing gum containing 0.4% to 0.6% eucalyptus extract can improve gingivitis in some people.
Bad breath. Early research shows that chewing gum containing 0.4% to 0.6% eucalyptus extract can improve bad breath in some people.
Head lice. Early research shows that applying eucalyptus oil and lemon tea tree oil might help to get rid of head lice, But it does not seem to be as effective as applying tea tree oil and lavender oil or benzyl alcohol, mineral oil, and triethanolamine.
Headache. Early research shows that applying a combination product containing eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, and ethanol to the head does not reduce pain in people with headaches. However, the product might help people with headaches relax and think better.

Bladder diseases.
Bleeding gums.
Burns.

Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of eucalyptus for these uses.",Eucalyptus leaf contains chemicals that might help control blood sugar. It also contains chemicals that might have activity against bacteria and fungi. Eucalyptus oil contains chemicals that might help pain and inflammation. It might also block chemicals that cause asthma.,"Eucalyptus leaf is LIKELY SAFE when consumed in the small amounts found in foods. There isn't enough information to know if supplements that contain larger amounts of eucalyptus leaf are safe when taken by mouth.

Eucalyptol, a chemical that is found in eucalyptus oil, is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 12 weeks. 

Eucalyptus oil is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when applied directly to the skin without being diluted. In can cause serious problems with the nervous system. There is not enough information to know if it is safe to apply diluted eucalyptus oil to the skin.

Eucalyptus oil is LIKELY UNSAFE when it is taken by mouth without first being diluted. Taking 3.5 mL of undiluted oil can be fatal. Signs of eucalyptus poisoning might include stomach pain and burning, dizziness, muscle weakness, small eye pupils, feelings of suffocation, and some others. Eucalyptus oil can also cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Eucalyptus is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women when consumed in food amounts. But don't use eucalyptus oil. Not enough is known about safety during pregnancy or breast-feeding.
Children: Eucalyptus oil is LIKELY UNSAFE for children when taken by mouth, applied to the skin, or inhaled. While some research shows that diluted eucalyptus oil may be safe to use as a shampoo to treat lice, there are reports of seizures and other nervous system side effects in infants and children exposed to eucalyptus oil. Infants and children should not use eucalyptus oil due to the serious potential side effects. Not much is known about the safety of using eucalyptus leaves in children. It's best to avoid use in amounts larger than food amounts.
Cross-allergenicity: Eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil contain many of the same compounds. People who are allergic to eucalyptus oil might also be allergic to tea tree oil or other essential oils.
Diabetes: Early research suggests eucalyptus leaf might lower blood sugar. There is concern that using eucalyptus while taking medications for diabetes might lower blood sugar too much. Blood sugar levels should be monitored closely.
Surgery: Since eucalyptus might affect blood sugar levels, there is concern that it might make blood sugar control difficult during and after surgery. Stop using eucalyptus at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Folate and folic acid are forms of a water-soluble B vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin. Since 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law. Foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables (such as spinach, broccoli, and lettuce), okra, asparagus, fruits (such as bananas, melons, and lemons) beans, yeast, mushrooms, meat (such as beef liver and kidney), orange juice, and tomato juice.

Folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency).

Women who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent miscarriage and ""neural tube defects."" Birth defects that occur due to folate deficiency such as spina bifida,  when the fetal spine and back do not close during development.  Folic acid is also tried for many other conditions including nerve pain in diabetes, heart disease, dementia, and many others. 

Folic acid is often used in combination with other B vitamins.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for FOLIC ACID are as follows:Effective for...Folate deficiency. Taking folic acid improves folate deficiency.Likely effective for...Serious kidney disease (end-stage renal disease or ESRD). About 85% of people with serious kidney disease have high levels of homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease and stroke. Taking folic acid lowers homocysteine levels in people with serious kidney disease. However, folic acid supplementation does not appear to reduce the risk of heart disease-related events.
High amounts of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). High levels of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease and stroke. Taking folic acid lowers homocysteine levels by 20% to 30% in people with normal to slightly elevated homocysteine levels. It is recommended that people with homocysteine levels greater than 11 micromoles/L supplement with folic acid and vitamin B12.
Toxicity caused by the drug methotrexate. Taking folic acid seems to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are possible side effects of methotrexate treatment.
Birth defects of the brain and spine (neural tube birth defects). Folic acid during pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube birth defects. It is recommended that pregnant women get 600-800 mcg of folic acid per day from their diet or supplements starting 1 month before pregnancy and during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a history of neural tube birth defects are advised to get 4000 mcg of folic acid per day.Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). Research shows that taking folic acid with other vitamins including vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 reduces the risk of developing age-related vision loss.
Depression. Limited research shows  that taking folic acid along with antidepressants seems to improve symptoms in people with depression.
High blood pressure. Research shows that taking folic acid daily for at least 6 weeks reduces blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But Taking folic acid with blood pressure medication does not seem to lower blood pressure more than taking only blood pressure medicine 
Gum enlargement caused by the drug phenytoin. Applying folic acid to the gums seems to prevent gum problems caused by phenytoin. However, taking folic acid by mouth does not seem to improve symptoms of this condition.
Gum disease in women who are pregnant. Applying folic acid to the gums seems to improve gum disease during pregnancy.
Stroke. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of stroke by 10% to 25% in people who live in countries that don't fortify grain products with folic acid. But folic acid doesn't seem to prevent strokes in most people who live in countries that do fortify grain products with folic acid.
A skin disorder that causes white patches to develop on the skin (vitiligo). Taking folic acid by mouth seems to improve symptoms of vitiligo.
Possibly ineffective for...
Low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia) due to iron deficiency. Taking folic acid with iron supplements is not more effective than taking the iron supplements without folic acid for treating and preventing iron deficiency and anemia caused by too little iron in the body.
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. Most research shows that taking folic acid does not prevent decline in memory and thinking skills in the elderly. 
A procedure to open a blocked or narrowed blood vessel (angioplasty). There is inconsistent evidence on the benefits of taking folic acid after a procedure to widen the blood vessels. But taking folic acid plus vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 might actually interfere with healing in cases where a device (stent) is inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open.
Breast cancer. Consuming folate in the diet might lower the risk of developing breast cancer in women who also eat high amounts of methionine, vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), or vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), but research is not consistent. Other research suggests that taking folic acid supplements alone does not lower the risk of breast cancer.
Heart disease. Most research shows that taking folic acid alone or with other B vitamins does not reduce the risk of death or heart disease-related events in people with heart disease.
Cataracts. Research shows that taking folic acid with other vitamins including vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 does not prevent cataracts. In fact, it might increase the chance of needing to have cataracts removed.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Daily injections of folic acid appear to have no effect on symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.
Diarrhea. Taking a specific nutritional supplement with added folic acid and possibly vitamin B12 does not seem to prevent diarrhea in children at risk of malnutrition. Taking this product may increase the risk of having diarrhea last more than a few days.
Fall prevention. Taking folic acid with vitamin B-12 does not seem to prevent falls in older people who are also taking vitamin D. 
Death of an unborn or premature baby. Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a baby die just before or after birth.
Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). Taking folate during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of childhood cancer of the white blood cells.
Toxicity from the drug lometrexol. Taking folic acid by mouth does not seem to reduce the harmful effects of the drug lometrexol.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). In elderly individuals with osteoporosis, taking folic acid with vitamin B12 and possibly vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) does not seem to prevent broken bones.
Physical performance in elderly adults. Taking folic acid with vitamin B-12 doesn't seem to help older people walk better or have stronger hands.
Infection of the airways. Taking a specific nutritional supplement with added folic acid and possibly vitamin B12 does not seem to prevent infections in the lungs in children at risk of malnutrition.
Likely ineffective for...Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma).Taking folic acid supplements does not seem to prevent growths in the large intestine or rectum.
An inherited condition marked by learning disabilities (fragile-X syndrome).Taking folic acid by mouth does not improve symptoms of fragile-X-syndrome.
Preterm birth. Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not decrease the risk of having a premature baby. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Acne. Limited evidence suggests that taking a specific nutritional supplement, containing vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), a compound isolated from grains (azelaic acid), zinc, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), copper, and folic acid (NicAzel, Elorac Inc., Vernon Hills, IL) appears to reduce inflammation associated with pimples on the face.
Alzheimer disease. Limited evidence suggests that elderly people who consume more folic acid than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) appear to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease than people who consume less folic acid.
Autism. Limited research suggests taking folic acid during pregnancy might reduce the risk of autism in the child.
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Beta-thalassemia is a disorder of the blood that results in the production of less hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. Patients with beta-thalassemia usually have bone and muscle pain and have less strength. In children with this disorder, limited research suggests taking folic acid by itself, or with L-carnitine a compound similar to an amino acid from protein, might reduce bone pain and help increase strength.
Bipolar disorder. Taking folic acid does not appear to improve the antidepressant effects of lithium in people with bipolar disorder. However, taking folate with the medication valproate improves the effects of valproate.
Cancer of the cervix. There is some evidence that increasing folic acid and folate intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin B12, might help to prevent cancer of the cervix.
Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Taking folic acid might help slow kidney function decline in people with CKD. But it is not beneficial when used along with vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). In fact, the combination might make kidney disease worse.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research suggests that taking folic acid or eating folate in the diet can reduce the risk of developing colon or rectal cancer. However, there is some research that does not suggest that taking folic acid or folate in the diet offers the same benefit. It is possible that folic acid may be more helpful for preventing colon cancer than rectal cancer or it may be more helpful for specific kinds of colon cancer.
Heart problems at birth. Women who take folic acid or prenatal vitamins containing folic acid have a lower chance of giving birth to babies with heart problems.
Diabetes. Taking folic acid supplements does not seem to benefit people with diabetes.
Epilepsy. Taking folic acid does not reduce seizures in people with epilepsy. However some early research suggests that folic acid might reduce seizures in children that are deficient in folic acid. 
Cancer of the esophagus. Research suggests that consuming more folate in the diet lowers the risk for developing cancer of the esophagus.
High amounts of homocysteine in the blood caused by the drug fenofibrate. Taking folic acid every other day might lower levels of homocysteine in the blood caused by the drug fenofibrate.
Stomach cancer. Research suggests that taking folic acid reduces the risk of developing some types of stomach cancer.
Gout. Early research suggests that folate might reduce the risk of gout.
Head and neck cancer. Getting more folic acid from the diet has been linked to a lower risk of head and neck cancer. 
Hearing loss. Low levels of folate in the blood seem to be related to the risk for sudden hearing loss in adults. Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid daily for 3 years slows the decline of hearing loss in older people who have low folate levels. It is not clear if folic acid supplementation reduces hearing loss in people with normal folate levels.
Infants born weighing less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces). Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not prevent some babies from being born at a low birth weight but it does seem to increase the overall average of birth weights. However, some early research suggests that taking folic acid before getting pregnant might reduce the risk of having a baby that is too small even when born full term. Although this risk is not reduced in mothers that start supplementation after the baby is conceived.
Lung cancer. There does not appear to be a relationship between low levels of folic acid and lung cancer in most people.
Male infertility. Some research suggests that taking folic acid plus zinc sulfate daily can increase sperm count in men with low sperm counts.
The most serious type of skin cancer (melanoma). Early research shows that taking folic acid might reduce the risk of melanoma.
Reduced benefit of nitrate therapy that happens when nitrates are used all day (nitrate tolerance). Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid does not help medications for chest pain (nitrates) work longer.
Cleft lip and cleft palate. Some research suggests that taking folic acid during pregnancy lowers the risk of cleft lip. However, other research shows no effect.
Pancreatic cancer. Eating more than 280 mcg of folate in the diet daily is linked to a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer. However, other research suggests that folate intake is not linked to pancreatic cancer risk.
Nerve damage in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). There is conflicting evidence about the role of folic acid in nerve pain for people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Some research suggests that taking folic acid with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and vitamin B12 improves some symptoms of nerve pain so that people feel happier. However, the nerves do not seem to function any better.
A type of throat cancer (pharyngeal cancer). Limited research suggests folic acid and folate from dietary and sources and supplements may protect against oropharyngeal cancer, a specific type of throat cancer.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Pre-eclampsia is marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy. Research regarding whether folic acid reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia is conflicting.
High blood pressure during pregnancy. Limited research found that taking folic acid during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
A disorder that causes leg discomfort and an irresistible urge to move the legs (restless legs syndrome or RLS). Taking folic acid seems to reduce symptoms of restless legs syndrome. Researchers are studying whether folic acid deficiency causes restless legs syndrome.
Schizophrenia. Taking a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 may reduce some of the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, but only in some patients with a specific genetic make-up. In most people, folic acid does not help with these symptoms.
Sickle-cell disease. Taking folic acid might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is not known if this will benefit people with sickle-cell disease.
Alcoholism.
Liver disease.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate folic acid for these uses.
",Folate is needed for the proper development of the human body. It is involved in producing the genetic material called DNA and in numerous other bodily functions.,"When taken by mouth: Folic acid is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth. Most adults do not experience any side effects when used in doses less than 1 mg daily.

Folic acid is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in large doses, long-term. Although doses up to 5 mg daily have been safely used in some research, doses of folic acid greater than 1 mg daily might cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea, rash, sleep disorders, irritability, confusion, nausea, stomach upset, behavior changes, skin reactions, seizures, gas, excitability, and other side effects.

There is also some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long period of time might cause serious side effects. Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 800 mcg to 1.2 mg daily might increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. Other research suggests that taking these high doses might also increase the risk of cancer such as lung or prostate cancer.
When given as a shot: Folic acid is LIKELY SAFE for most people when injected into the body. Most adults do not experience any side effects when used in doses less than 1 mg daily.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Folic acid is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately during pregnancy and breast-feeing. Taking 300-400 mcg of folic acid daily is commonly used during pregnancy to prevent birth defects.
Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty): Using folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intravenously (by IV) or by mouth might worsen narrowed arteries. Folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure.
Cancer: Early research suggests that taking 800 mcg to 1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. Until more is known, people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid.
Heart disease: Early research suggests that taking folic acid plus vitamin B6 might increase the risk for heart attack in people with a history of heart disease.
Malaria: Early research suggests that taking folic acid plus iron might increase the risk of death or need for treatment in hospital in areas of the world where malaria is common.
Anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency: Taking folic acid might mask anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and delay appropriate treatment.
Seizure disorder: Taking folic acid supplements might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders, particularly in high doses.

Fucus vesiculosus is a type of brown seaweed. People use the whole plant to make medicine.

People use Fucus vesiculosus for conditions such as thyroid disorders, iodine deficiency, obesity, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.  Using Fucus vesiculosus can also be unsafe.

Don't confuse Fucus vesiculosus with bladderwort.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for FUCUS VESICULOSUS are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Obesity. Early research suggests that taking Fucus vesiculosus along with lecithin and vitamins doesn't help people lose weight.
Achy joints (rheumatism).
Arthritis.
""Blood cleansing"".
Constipation.
Digestive problems.
""Hardening of the arteries"" (arteriosclerosis).
Iodine deficiency.
Thyroid problems, including an over-sized thyroid gland (goiter).
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of Fucus vesiculosus for these uses.","Fucus vesiculosus  contains varying amounts of iodine. The iodine might help prevent or treat some thyroid disorders. Fucus vesiculosus also might have antidiabetic effects, and may affect hormone levels. But more information is needed.","Fucus vesiculosus is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin. It is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth. It may contain high concentrations of iodine. Large amounts of iodine can cause or worsen some thyroid problems. It may also contain heavy metals, which can cause heavy metal poisoning. Treatment of thyroid problems should not be attempted without medical supervision.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Fucus vesiculosus is POSSIBLY UNSAFE during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Don't use it.
Bleeding disorders: Fucus vesiculosus might slow blood clotting. In theory, Fucus vesiculosus might increase the risk of bruising or bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Diabetes: Fucus vesiculosus may affect blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes and take medications to lower your blood sugar, adding Fucus vesiculosus might make your blood sugar drop too low. Monitor your blood sugar carefully.
Infertility: Preliminary research suggests that taking Fucus vesiculosus might make it harder for women to get pregnant.
Iodine allergy: Fucus vesiculosus contains significant amounts of iodine, which could cause an allergic reaction in sensitive people. Don't use it.
Surgery: Fucus vesiculosus might slow blood clotting. There is a concern that it might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking Fucus vesiculosus at least 2 weeks before surgery.
Thyroid problems known as hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone), or hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone): Fucus vesiculosus contains significant amounts of iodine, which might make hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism worse.

Gelatin is a protein made from animal products.

Gelatin is used for aging skin and joint pain. It is also used for many other conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, anemia, weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis), and brittle nails, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. 

In manufacturing, gelatin is used for preparation of foods, cosmetics, and medicines.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GELATIN are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Aging skin. Some research shows that taking specific gelatin products (Wellnex, Nitta Gelatin) 5 grams daily, mixed into a hot beverage, improves skin moisture and wrinkles in women with aging skin. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Early research in pregnant women with a mild form of this blood disorder shows that taking gelatin made from donkey hide improves hemoglobin levels. 
Joint pain. Some research shows that taking gelatin daily reduces pain during athletic activity in athletes that have knee pain. But gelatin does not improve pain at rest. Taking gelatin does not seem to reduce joint pain in older adults with general knee pain. 
Osteoarthritis. Some research shows that gelatin might relieve pain and improve joint function in people with osteoarthritis. But not all research agrees.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis).
Improving hair quality.
Muscle damage caused by exercise.
Strengthening bones and joints.
Brittle nails.
Obesity.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of gelatin for these uses.",Gelatin is made from collagen. Collagen is one of the materials that make up cartilage and bone. Some people think gelatin might help for arthritis and other joint conditions. The chemicals in gelatin called amino acids can be absorbed in the body. ,"When taken by mouth: Gelatin is LIKELY SAFE for most people in food amounts. The larger amounts used in medicine are POSSIBLY SAFE. There's some evidence that gelatin in doses up to 10 grams daily can be safely used for up to 6 months.

Gelatin can cause an unpleasant taste, sensation of heaviness in the stomach, bloating, heartburn, and belching. Gelatin can also cause allergic reactions. In some people, allergic reactions have been severe enough to damage the heart and cause death.

There is some concern about the safety of gelatin because it comes from animal sources. Some people are worried that unsafe manufacturing practices might lead to contamination of gelatin products with diseased animal tissues including those that might transmit mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). Although this risk seems to be low, many experts advise against using animal-derived supplements like gelatin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy: A specific type of gelatin that is made from donkey hide is POSSIBLY SAFE in the larger amounts used as medicine. Not enough is known about the safety of other kinds of gelatin when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the safety of gelatin when used in medicinal amounts during breast-feeding.

Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is produced naturally in humans. It is also found in seashells, or it can be made in the laboratory. Glucosamine hydrochloride is one of several forms of glucosamine.


It is important to read the labels of glucosamine products carefully since several different forms of glucosamine are sold as supplements. These products may contain glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities. But they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has been done using glucosamine sulfate. See the separate listing for glucosamine sulfate. The information on this page is about glucosamine hydrochloride.

Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, MSM, or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.

Products that contain glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin vary a great deal. Some do not contain what the label claims. The difference can range from 25% to 115%. Some products in the US that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate. This product will likely have different effects than one containing glucosamine sulfate.

Glucosamine hydrochloride is used for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, a jaw disorder called temporomandibular disorder (TMD), joint pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GLUCOSAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Heart disease. People who take glucosamine might have a lower risk of developing heart disease. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine sulfate and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits. 
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Early research suggests that glucosamine hydrochloride does not affect cholesterol or triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol. 
A disorder that affects the bones and joints, usually in people with selenium deficiency (Kashin-Beck disease). Early evidence shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with chondroitin sulfate reduces pain and improves physical function in adults with a bone and joint disorder called Kashin-Beck disease. The effects of glucosamine sulfate on symptoms of Kashin-Beck disease are mixed when the supplement is taken as a single agent.
Knee pain. There is some early evidence that glucosamine hydrochloride might relieve pain for some people with frequent knee pain. But other research shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with other ingredients does not relieve pain or improve walking ability in people with knee pain.
Osteoarthritis. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of glucosamine hydrochloride for osteoarthritis. Most of the evidence supporting the use of glucosamine hydrochloride comes from studies of a particular product (CosaminDS). This product contains a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and manganese ascorbate. Some evidence suggests that this combination can improve pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. This combination might work better in people with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis than in people with severe osteoarthritis. Another product (Gurukosamin & Kondoroichin) containing glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and quercetin glycosides also seems to improve knee osteoarthritis symptoms.



The effects of taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with only chondroitin sulfate are mixed. Some evidence shows that taking a specific product (Droglican) containing glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate reduces pain in adults with knee osteoarthritis. However, other research shows that formulas containing glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate are not effective at reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.



Most research suggests that taking glucosamine hydrochloride alone does not reduce pain in people with osteoarthritis of the knee.

More research has been done on glucosamine sulfate (see separate listing) than on glucosamine hydrochloride. There is some thought that glucosamine sulfate may be more effective than glucosamine hydrochloride for osteoarthritis. Most research comparing the two forms of glucosamine showed no difference. However, some researchers have criticized the quality of some of these studies.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research shows that taking a specific glucosamine hydrochloride product (Rohto Pharmaceuticals Co.) in combination with prescription medical treatments reduces pain compared to a sugar pill. However, this product does not seem to decrease inflammation or reduce the number of painful or swollen joints.
Stroke. People who take glucosamine might have a slightly lower risk of having a stroke. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine sulfate and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.
A group of painful conditions that affect the jaw joint and muscle (temporomandibular disorders or TMD). Early research shows that taking a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and calcium ascorbate twice daily reduces joint swelling and pain, as well as noise made at the jaw joint, in people with temporomandibular disorder.
A group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma).
Back pain.
Weight loss.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate glucosamine hydrochloride for these uses.","Glucosamine in the body is used to make a ""cushion"" that surrounds the joints. In osteoarthritis, this cushion becomes thinner and stiff. Taking glucosamine hydrochloride as a supplement might help to supply the materials needed to rebuild the cushion.
Some researchers believe that glucosamine hydrochloride might not work as well as glucosamine sulfate.  They think the ""sulfate"" part of glucosamine sulfate is the important factor because sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage.","When taken by mouth: Glucosamine hydrochloride is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth appropriately for up to 2 years. Glucosamine hydrochloride can cause gas, bloating, and cramps.

Some glucosamine products do not contain the labeled amount of glucosamine or contain excessive amounts of manganese. Ask your healthcare provider about reliable brands.


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if glucosamine hydrochloride is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Asthma: Glucosamine hydrochloride might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use caution with glucosamine hydrochloride.
Diabetes: Some preliminary research suggests that glucosamine might raise blood sugar in people with diabetes. However, more reliable research indicates that glucosamine does not seem to significantly affect blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Glucosamine with routine blood sugar monitoring appears to be safe for most people with diabetes.
Glaucoma: Glucosamine hydrochloride might increase the pressure inside the eye and could worsen glaucoma. If you have glaucoma, talk to your healthcare provider before taking glucosamine.
High cholesterol: There is some concern that glucosamine might increase cholesterol levels in some people. Glucosamine might increase insulin levels. High insulin levels are associated with increased cholesterol levels. However, this effect has not been reported in humans. To be on the safe side, monitor your cholesterol levels closely if you take glucosamine hydrochloride and have high cholesterol levels.
High blood pressure: There is some concern that glucosamine might increase blood pressure in some people. Glucosamine might increase insulin levels. High insulin levels are associated with increased blood pressure. However, this effect has not been reported in humans. To be on the safe side, monitor your blood pressure closely if you take glucosamine hydrochloride and have high blood pressure.
Shellfish allergy: There is some concern that glucosamine products might cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to shellfish. Glucosamine is produced from the shells of shrimp, lobster, and crabs. However, allergic reactions in people with shellfish allergy are caused by the meat of shellfish, not the shell. There are no reports of allergic reactions to glucosamine in people who are allergic to shellfish. There is also some information that people with shellfish allergy can safely take glucosamine products.
Surgery: Glucosamine hydrochloride might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using glucosamine hydrochloride at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/747.html,"Tsuruta A, Horiike T, Yoshimura M, Nagaoka I.

Glucosamine sulfate is a naturally occurring chemical found in the human body. It is in the fluid around joints. Glucosamine also exists in other places in nature. For example, glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements is often obtained from the shells of shellfish. Glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements does not always come from natural sources. It can also be made in a laboratory.

There are different forms of glucosamine including glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities, but they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has involved glucosamine sulfate. See separate listings for glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine.

Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine sulfate alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.

Some glucosamine sulfate products are not labeled accurately. In some cases, the amount of glucosamine actually in the product has varied from none to over 100% of the amount stated on the product's label. Some products have contained glucosamine hydrochloride when glucosamine sulfate was listed on the label.

Glucosamine sulfate is most commonly used for osteoarthritis. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE are as follows:Likely effective for...
Osteoarthritis. Most research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate can provide some pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, especially those with osteoarthritis of the knees.  For some people, glucosamine sulfate might work as well as over-the-counter and prescription pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen; however, pain medications work quickly while glucosamine sulfate can take 4-8 weeks before it provides pain relief.  Also, people who take glucosamine sulfate often still need to take pain medications for pain flare-ups.
  
In addition to relieving pain, glucosamine sulfate might also slow the breakdown of joints and prevent the condition from getting worse if it is taken for several years. Some research shows that people who take glucosamine sulfate might be less likely to need total knee replacement surgery.

There are several kinds of glucosamine products.  The most research showing benefit is for products that contain glucosamine sulfate.  Products that contain glucosamine hydrochloride do not seem to work as well.  Many products contain both glucosamine with chondroitin, but there is no evidence that these products work any better than glucosamine sulfate by itself. 

Glucosamine sulfate does not seem to prevent people from getting osteoarthritis. 


Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Joint pain caused by drugs called aromatase inhibitors (aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias). Early research suggests that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in two or three divided doses daily for 24 weeks reduces pain in women taking drugs that lower estrogen levels for early stage breast cancer. 
Heart disease. People who take glucosamine might have a lower risk of developing heart disease. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.
Knee pain. Some research shows that taking a specific product containing glucosamine sulfate, methylsufonlylmethane, white willow bark extract, ginger root concentrate, Indian frankincense extract, turmeric root extract, cayenne, and hyaluronic acid (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital, Charlotte, NC) in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain in people with knee pain. But this product doesn't seem to help joint stiffness or function. Other early research shows that taking 1500 mg of glucosamine sulfate daily for 28 days does not reduce knee pain in athletes following a knee injury. However, it does seem to improve knee movement. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS). Early research shows that taking 1000 mg of glucosamine sulfate by mouth daily for 6 months might reduce the relapse of multiple sclerosis. 
Recovery after surgery. Early research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate does not improve function, pain, and performance in male athletes who had surgery to fix a torn ACL. The ACL is a ligament that holds the knee in place during movement.
Stroke. People who take glucosamine might have a slightly lower risk of having a stroke. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.
Jaw pain (Temporomandibular disorder). Some research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate works about as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, etc.) for relieving jaw pain. In some people, pain relief appears to continue for up to 90 days after glucosamine sulfate is discontinued. But research suggests that when 1200 mg of glucosamine sulfate is taken by mouth daily for 6 months, jaw pain and the ability to open the jaw are not improved.

Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate glucosamine sulfate for these uses. ","Glucosamine sulfate is a chemical found in the human body.  It is used by the body to produce a variety of other chemicals that are involved in building tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the thick fluid that surrounds joints.  

Joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage that surround them.  In some people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes thin.  This results in more joint friction, pain, and stiffness. Researchers think that taking glucosamine supplements may either increase the cartilage and fluid surrounding joints or help prevent breakdown of these substances, or maybe both.

Some researchers think the ""sulfate"" part of glucosamine sulfate is also important.  Sulfate is needed by the body to produce cartilage.  This is one reason why researchers believe that glucosamine sulfate might work better than other forms of glucosamine such as glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine.  These other forms do not contain sulfate. ","When taken by mouth: Glucosamine sulfate is LIKELY SAFE  in most adults. Glucosamine sulfate can cause some mild side effects including nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, and constipation. Uncommon side effects are drowsiness, skin reactions, and headache. 
When given as a shot: Glucosamine sulfate is POSSIBLY SAFE when injected into the muscle as a shot twice weekly for up to 6 weeks.
When applied to the skin: Glucosamine sulfate is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin in combination with chondroitin sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor for up to 8 weeks.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy or breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if glucosamine sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. 
Asthma: There is one report linking an asthma attack with taking glucosamine.  It is not known for sure if glucosamine was the cause of the asthma attack.  Until more is known, people with asthma should be cautious about taking products that contain glucosamine.
Diabetes: Some early research suggested that glucosamine sulfate might raise blood sugar in people with diabetes. However, more recent and more reliable research now shows that glucosamine sulfate does not seem to affect blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes. Glucosamine appears to be safe for most people with diabetes, but blood sugar should be monitored closely.
Glaucoma: Glucosamine sulfate might increase the pressure inside the eye and could worsen glaucoma. If you have glaucoma, talk to your healthcare provider before taking glucosamine.
High cholesterol: Animal research suggests that glucosamine may increase cholesterol levels. In contrast, glucosamine does not seem to increase cholesterol levels in humans. However, some early research suggests that glucosamine might increase insulin levels. This might cause cholesterol levels to increase. To be on the safe side, monitor your cholesterol levels closely if you take glucosamine sulfate and have high cholesterol.
High blood pressure: Early research suggests that glucosamine sulfate can increase insulin levels. This might cause blood pressure to increase. However, more reliable research suggests that glucosamine sulfate does not increase blood pressure. To be on the safe side, monitor your blood pressure closely if you take glucosamine sulfate and have high blood pressure.
Shellfish allergy: Because some glucosamine sulfate products are made from the shells of shrimp, lobsters or crabs, there is concern that glucosamine products might cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to shellfish. However, allergic reactions in people with shellfish allergy are typically caused by the meat of shellfish, not the shell.  There are no reports of allergic reactions to glucosamine in people who are allergic to shellfish.  There is also some information that people with shellfish allergy can safely take glucosamine products.
Surgery: Glucosamine sulfate might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking glucosamine sulfate at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/807.html,"Gregori D, Giacovelli G, Minto C, et al.

Goji is a plant that grows in the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The berries and root bark are used to make medicine. 


Goji is used for many conditions including diabetes, weight loss, improving quality of life, and as a tonic, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses. 

In foods, the berries are eaten raw or used in cooking.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GOJI are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking carbohydrates from goji fruit twice daily for 3 months reduces blood sugar after eating in people with diabetes. It might work best in people who are not taking medicine for diabetes.
Dry eyes. Early research shows that using eye drops and drinking a beverage containing goji fruit and other ingredients for one month can improve symptoms of dry eyes better than using eye drops alone. It's not known if the benefit is due to goji fruit, other ingredients, or the combination.
Quality of life. Some early research shows that drinking goji juice for up to 30 days improves various quality of life measures. Energy, quality of sleep, mental function, bowel regularity, mood, and feelings of contentment seem to improve. Short-term memory and eyesight do not.
Weight loss. Early research shows that drinking goji juice for 2 weeks while dieting and exercising decreases waist size in overweight adults better than dieting and exercising alone. But drinking the juice doesn't further improve weight or body fat.
Blood circulation problems.
Cancer.
Dizziness.
Fever.
High blood pressure.
Malaria.
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus).
Sexual problems (impotence).
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of goji for these uses.",Goji contains chemicals that might help lower blood pressure and blood sugar. Goji might also help stimulate the immune system and protect organs from oxidative damage.,"Goji is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken appropriately by mouth, short-term. It has been used safely for up to 3 months. In very rare cases, goji fruit can cause increased sensitivity to sunlight, liver damage, and allergic reactions.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the safety of using goji during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There is some concern that goji fruit might cause the uterus to contract. But this has not been reported in humans. Until more is known, stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to protein in certain products: Goji might cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to tobacco, peaches, tomatoes, and nuts.
Diabetes: Goji might lower blood sugar. It might cause blood sugar to drop too much if you are taking medications for diabetes. Monitor your blood sugar levels carefully.
Low blood pressure: Goji might lower blood pressure. If your blood pressure is already low, taking goji might make it drop too much.

Grapes are the fruit of grapevines. Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca are two common grapevine species. Vitis labrusca is commonly known as Concord grapes. The whole fruit, skin, leaves and seed of the grape plant are used as medicine. Grape seeds are by-products of the manufacturing of wine. Be careful not to confuse grape with grapefruit, and other similar sounding medicines.

Extracts from grape leaves and grape seeds are most commonly used for poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell (chronic venous insufficiency or CVI). Grape products are also commonly used for diseases of the heart and blood vessels, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and many other conditions. But there is limited scientific evidence to support these uses. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GRAPE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell (chronic venous insufficiency or CVI). Taking grape seed extract or proanthocyanidin, a chemical in grape seeds, by mouth seems to reduce symptoms of CVI such as tired or heavy legs, tension, and tingling and pain. Research suggests that taking a specific grape leaf extract by mouth decreases leg swelling after 6 weeks.
Eye stress. Taking grape seed extract by mouth might help decrease stress on the eyes from glare.Possibly ineffective for...Hay fever. Taking grape seed extract for 8 weeks before ragweed pollen season does not seem to decrease seasonal allergy symptoms or the need to use allergy medications.
Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer drug treatment. Taking 4 ounces of chilled Concord grape juice 30 minutes before meals for a week following each cycle of chemotherapy does not seem to reduce nausea or vomiting caused by chemotherapy.
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The term LUTS is typically used to describe symptoms associated with overactive bladder. Drinking Concord grade juice doesn't seem to improve these symptoms in older men.
Breast pain (mastalgia). Taking proanthocyanidin, a chemical found in grape seed extract, three times daily for 6 months does not reduce breast tissue hardness, pain, or tenderness in people treated with radiation therapy for breast cancer.
Obesity. Drinking Concord grape juice or taking grape seed extract or grape pomace does not seem to reduce weight in overweight people. However, it might help to lower cholesterolcontrol blood sugar.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Aging skin. Early research shows that taking a specific combination product containing grape skin extract, marine collagen peptides, coenzyme Q10, luteolin, and selenium for 2 months might improve some markers of aging skin such as elasticity. But it doesn't seem to improve skin moisture or how the skin appears based on age. 
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Early research shows that taking a specific product containing grape seed oil, garlic, hops, green tea, and antioxidants for 1 year might help prevent cholesterol plaques from forming in the arteries. But it doesn't appear to prevent the growth of plaques already present in the arteries. It also doesn't appear to improve levels of cholesterol. 
Athletic performance. Early research shows that taking 400 mg of grape extract daily for one month might increase an athlete's overall power when jumping, but not the initial power or maintaining power. Other early research shows that drinking juice prepared from whole grape powder does not improve how well the body uses oxygen or running ability.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that applying a cream containing vitamin E and chemicals found in grapes and green tea doesn't reduce symptoms of eczema.
Heart disease. There is some early evidence that drinking grape juice or red wine might reduce risk factors linked with heart disease, such as inflammation, clot formation, and oxidative damage to blood fats. But it's not known if grape products specifically reduce heart disease risk.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research shows that drinking Concord grape juice helps middle-aged women focus while driving. Also taking a grape fruit extract for 12 weeks seems to improve attention, language, and memory in older people without age-related memory problems. It's unclear if grape improves mental function or memory in older people with age-related memory problems. 
Decline in memory and thinking skills in older people that is more than what is normal for their age. Most early research suggests that grape does not improve mental function or memory in older people with memory problems. 
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Taking a product containing grape seed extract and other ingredients while being treated with cancer drugs seems to help prevent colon and rectal cancer from progressing. But it doesn't seem to improve survival.
Vision problems in people with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Early evidence suggests that taking a specific grape seed extract product containing 100-200 mg of a chemical called proanthocyanidin daily can slow the progression of eye damage caused by diabetes.
High cholesterol. Taking grape seed extract alone or with chromium might reduce some measures of cholesterol in people with high cholesterol. But it doesn't seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol or lower blood fats called triglycerides. And when taken with chromium, it's possible that any cholesterol improvement is due to chromium not grape seed extract.
High blood pressure. Most research has evaluated grape seed extract or isolated chemicals from grape called polyphenols in people with high blood pressure. Single studies show conflicting results. But analyses of multiple studies suggests that grape seed extract or grape polyphenols can slightly lower blood pressure in healthy people or those with high blood pressure. They seem to work best in people who are obese or those with metabolic syndrome. It might take 8 weeks for benefits to be seen. But people with high blood pressure should lean away from taking high doses of grape seed extract with vitamin C. This combination might worsen blood pressure.
Dark skin patches on the face (melasma). Early research suggests that taking grape seed extract by mouth for 6-11 months reduces dark skin discolorations in Japanese women.
Symptoms of menopause. Taking grape seed extract daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce hot flashes, anxiety, and some physical symptoms of menopause. It may also improve lean body mass and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number in a blood pressure reading). But grape seed extract doesn't seem to improve insomnia or depression.
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase the risk for heart disease. Early research in men suggests that whole grapes might improve some of the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, such as high blood pressure and decreased blood flow. Drinking grape juice for one month also seems to improve blood flow in teenagers with metabolic syndrome. And taking a specific product containing grape seed extract for 4 weeks seems to lower blood pressure in people with metabolic syndrome. But it is not known if these changes decrease the risk for diabetes or other aspects of metabolic syndrome.
Minor bleeding. An epiostomy is a surgical cut used to enlarge the opening of the vagina to aid in childbirth. Early research shows that using a product called Ankaferd blood stopper, which contains alpinia, licorice, thyme, stinging nettle, and grape vine helps to reduce bleeding during epiostomy repair. But it doesn't reduce surgical time.
Muscle soreness. Early research shows that drinking juice prepared from grape powder for 6 weeks before an arm exercise test does not reduce pain or swelling one or two days after the exercise.
Ability to see in low-light conditions. Early research suggests that grape seed extract containing chemicals called proanthocyanidins might improve night vision.
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Research shows that taking grape seed extract for 3 months improves some blood tests of liver damage in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Early research suggests that taking a specific grape seed extract product might reduce PMS symptoms, including pain and swelling.
Wound healing. Early research shows that applying cream containing 2% grape seed extract reduces the time for wound healing after removal of skin lesions.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Canker sores.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Constipation.
Cough.
Diarrhea.
Heavy menstrual periods.
Hemorrhoids.
Liver damage.
Treating varicose veins.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of grape for these uses.","Grape contains flavonoids, which can have antioxidant effects, lower the levels of low density lipoproteins (LDLs, or ""bad cholesterol""), relax blood vessels, and reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.  The antioxidants in grape might help to prevent heart disease and have other potentially beneficial effects. Red grape varieties provide more antioxidants than white or blush grape varieties.

Grape leaf might reduce inflammation and have astringent effects. In other words, grape leaf seems to be able to draw tissue together, which could help stop bleeding and diarrhea.  These properties appear to be greatest in the red leaves.","When taken by mouth: Grape is LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods. But keep in mind that, due to its size and shape, whole grapes are a potential choking hazard for children aged 5 years and younger. To reduce the risk, whole grapes should be cut in half or quartered before being served to children.

Grape is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in medicinal amounts. Grape seed extracts have been used safely in studies for up to 14 weeks. Eating large quantities of grapes, dried grapes, raisins, or sultanas might cause diarrhea. Some people have allergic reactions to grapes and grape products. Some other potential side effects include stomach upset, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, cough, dry mouth, sore throat, infections, headache, and muscular problems.
When applied to the skin: There isn't enough reliable information to know if grape is safe or what the side effects might be.
When used in the vagina: There isn't enough reliable information to know if grape is safe or what the side effects might be.


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if grape is safe to use in medicinal amounts when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid using more than amounts normally found in foods.
Bleeding conditions: Grape might slow blood clotting. Taking grape might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding conditions. However, there are no reports of this occurring in humans.
Surgery: Grape might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using medicinal amounts of grape at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/472.html,"Martínez-Maqueda D, Zapatera B, Gallego-Narbón A, Vaquero MP, Saura-Calixto F, Pérez-Jiménez J.

Grapefruit is a citrus fruit. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts from the seed as medicine. Grapefruit seed extract is processed from grapefruit seeds and pulp obtained as a byproduct from grapefruit juice production. Vegetable glycerin is added to the final product to reduce acidity and bitterness.

Grapefruit is commonly taken by mouth for weight loss. It is also used for asthma, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is not good scientific evidence to support these other uses.

In food and beverages, grapefruit is consumed as a fruit, juice, and is used as a flavoring component.

In manufacturing, grapefruit oil and seed extract are used as a fragrance component in soaps and cosmetics; and as a household cleaner for fruits, vegetables, meats, kitchen surfaces, dishes, and others.

In agriculture, grapefruit seed extract is used to kill bacteria and fungus, fight mold growth, kill parasites in animal feeds, preserve food and disinfect water.

It's important to remember that drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. The chemistry of the grapefruit varies by the species, the growing conditions, and the process used to extract the juice. Before adding grapefruit to your diet or your list of natural medicines, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GRAPEFRUIT are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Weight loss. Taking a specific product containing sweet orange, blood orange, and grapefruit extracts seems to decrease body weight and body fat in overweight people. Some research also shows that eating fresh grapefruit daily increases weight loss in overweight people.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Asthma. Some research shows that eating vitamin C-rich citrus fruits, including grapefruit and others, might improve lung function in people with asthma. But other studies have not shown this benefit.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that grapefruit seed extract can decrease constipation, gas, and stomach discomfort in people with eczema. This benefit may be due to the effect of grapefruit on intestinal bacteria.
High cholesterol. Early research suggest that taking grapefruit pectin daily for 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol compared to baseline.
High blood fats called triglycerides. Eating one grapefruit per day appears to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in people with high triglyceride levels.
Lice. Early research shows that applying a shampoo containing grapefruit extract to the hair of children for 10-20 minutes kills lice. Applying the shampoo again 10 days later helps remove any remaining nits.
Depression.
Digestive complaints in people with eczema.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).
Infections.
Muscle tiredness.
Preventing cancer.
Promoting hair growth.
Psoriasis.
Reducing acne and oily skin.
Stress.
Treating headaches.
Toning the skin.
Yeast infections (as a vaginal douche).
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of grapefruit for these uses.","Grapefruit is a source of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, pectin, and other nutrients. Some components might have antioxidant effects that might help protect cells from damage or reduce cholesterol.

It is not clear how the oil might work for medicinal uses.","Grapefruit is LIKELY SAFE in the amounts normally used as food and POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for medicinal purposes.


Grapefruit is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high amounts. If you take any medications, check with your healthcare provider before adding grapefruit to your diet or using it as a medicine. Grapefruit interacts with a long list of medications (see ""Are there any interactions with medications?"" below).
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of grapefruit during pregnancy and breast-feeding.  Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Breast cancer: There is concern about the safety of drinking excessive amounts of grapefruit juice. Some research suggests that postmenopausal women who consume a quart or more of grapefruit juice every day have a 25% to 30% increased chance of developing breast cancer. Grapefruit juice decreases how estrogen is broken down in the body and might increase estrogen levels in the body. More research is needed to confirm these findings. Until more is known, avoid drinking excessive amounts of grapefruit juice, especially if you have breast cancer or are at higher than usual risk for developing breast cancer.
Diseases of the heart muscle: Consuming grapefruit juice might increase the potential for abnormal heart rhythm. People with these diseases should consume grapefruit juice in moderation.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Consuming large amounts of grapefruit might increase hormone levels and therefore increase the risk of hormone sensitive conditions. Women with hormone sensitive conditions should avoid grapefruit.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/946.html,"Shang DW, Wang ZZ, Hu HT, et al.

 ""Green coffee"" beans are coffee seeds (beans) of Coffea fruits that have not yet been roasted. The roasting process of coffee beans reduces amounts of the chemical chlorogenic acid. Therefore, green coffee beans have a higher level of chlorogenic acid compared to regular, roasted coffee beans. Chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to have health benefits. 

Green coffee became popular for weight loss after it was mentioned on the Dr. Oz show in 2012. The Dr. Oz show referred to it as ""The green coffee bean that burns fat fast"" and claims that no exercise or diet is needed.

People take green coffee by mouth for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, and bacterial infections.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GREEN COFFEE are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
High blood pressure. Early research suggests that taking green coffee extracts containing 50 mg to 140 mg of chlorogenic acids daily for 4 weeks to 12 weeks can reduce blood pressure in Japanese adults with mild and untreated high blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure (the top number) appears to be reduced by 5 mmHg to 10 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) appears to be reduced by 3 mmHg to 7 mmHg.
Obesity. Early research shows that adults with obesity who take a specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex) five times daily for 8 weeks to 12 weeks, either alone or together with the regular coffee product Coffee Slender (Med-Eq Ltd., Tonsberg, Norway), lose an average of 2.5 to 3.7 kg more weight than people taking a placebo or regular coffee by itself.
Alzheimer's disease.
Type 2 diabetes.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate green coffee for these uses.","Green coffee beans are coffee beans that have not yet been roasted. These coffee beans contain a higher amount of the chemical chlorogenic acid. This chemical is thought to have health benefits. For high blood pressure it might affect blood vessels so that blood pressure is reduced.

For weight loss, chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to affect how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism.","Green coffee is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Green coffee extracts taken in doses up to 480 mg daily have been used safely for up to 12 weeks. Also, a specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex) has been used safely in doses up to 200 mg five times daily for up to 12 weeks.

Green coffee also contains caffeine. There is much less caffeine in green coffee than in regular coffee. But green coffee can still cause caffeine-related side effects similar to coffee.

Caffeine can cause insomnia, nervousness and restlessness, stomach upset, nausea and vomiting, increased heart and breathing rate, and other side effects. Consuming large amounts of coffee might also cause headache, anxiety, agitation, ringing in the ears, and irregular heartbeats.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking green coffee if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Abnormally high levels of homocysteine: Consuming a high dose of chlorogenic acid for a short duration has caused increased plasma homocysteine levels, which may be associated with conditions such as heart disease.
Anxiety disorders: The caffeine in green coffee might make anxiety worse.
Bleeding disorders: There is some concern that the caffeine in green coffee might make bleeding disorders worse.
Diabetes: Some research suggests that caffeine contained in green coffee might change the way people with diabetes process sugar. Caffeine has been reported to cause increases as well as decreases in blood sugar. Use caffeine with caution if you have diabetes and monitor your blood sugar carefully.
Diarrhea: Green coffee contains caffeine. The caffeine in coffee, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Glaucoma: Taking caffeine which is contained in green coffee can increases pressure inside the eye. The increase starts within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes.
High blood pressure: Taking caffeine found in green coffee might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this effect might be less in people who consume caffeine from green coffee or other sources regularly.
High cholesterol: Certain components of unfiltered coffee have been shown to increase cholesterol levels. These components can be found in green coffee as well. However, it is unclear if green coffee can also cause increased cholesterol levels.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Green coffee contains caffeine. The caffeine in green coffee, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen the diarrhea some people have with IBS.
Thinning bones (osteoporosis): Caffeine from green coffee and other sources can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. This might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, limit caffeine consumption to less than 300 mg per day. Taking calcium supplements may help to make up for calcium that is lost. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium from your food or supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine daily (about 20 cups of green coffee) doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women who have an inherited condition that keeps them from processing vitamin D normally, should be especially cautious when using caffeine.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/1264.html,"Wikoff D, Welsh BT, Henderson R, et al.

Guarana is a plant. It is named for the Guarani tribe in the Amazon, who used its seeds to brew a drink. Today, guarana seeds are still used as medicine.

People take guarana by mouth for obesity, athletic performance, mental performance, to increase energy, as an aphrodisiac, and for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Guarana can also be unsafe when taken long-term in large amounts.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GUARANA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Anxiety. Early research shows that taking a product containing hawthorn, black horehound, passionflower, valerian, cola nut, and guarana can reduce anxiety in some people. It is not clear if guarana alone is beneficial.
Lack of appetite in people with cancer. Early research shows that taking guarana extract slightly improves appetite and prevents weight loss in people with cancer who have lost their appetite and are losing weight. But the benefit is very small.
Tiredness in people treated with cancer drugs. Some research shows that taking guarana can reduce feelings of tiredness in some people undergoing chemotherapy. But conflicting results exist.
Improving memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research in healthy people shows that taking a single dose of guarana extract can improve thinking speed and some aspects of memory. However, other research shows that taking guarana does not improve mental function in adults or older people.
Athletic performance. Research shows that taking a single dose of a product containing guarana, B vitamins, vitamin C, and minerals improves exercise tolerance in trained athletes by a very small amount. It is not clear if guarana alone is beneficial.
Obesity. Taking guarana along with mate and damiana seems to increase weight loss. There is also developing evidence that taking a specific combination product containing guarana, ephedra, and 17 other vitamins, minerals, and supplements helps reduce weight by approximately 2.7 kg over 8 weeks when used with a low-fat diet and exercise. It is not clear if guarana alone is beneficial.
Feelings of well-being. Early research shows that taking guarana does not improve feelings of well-being in healthy individuals.
Serious illness caused by radiation exposure. Research shows that taking guarana does not improve symptoms of depression or tiredness in people undergoing radiation treatment.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of guarana for these uses.","Guarana contains caffeine. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and muscles. Guarana also contains theophylline and theobromine, which are chemicals similar to caffeine.","When taken by mouth: Guarana is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. When taken by mouth in medicinal amounts for a short time, guarana is POSSIBLY SAFE.

When taken by mouth in high doses for a long time, guarana is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Guarana contains caffeine. Doses containing more than 400 mg of caffeine daily have been linked to side effects. Side effects depend on the dose. At typical doses, the caffeine in guarana can cause insomnia, nervousness and restlessness, stomach irritation, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate and blood pressure, rapid breathing, tremors, delirium, diuresis, and other side effects. Large guarana doses might cause headache, anxiety, agitation, ringing in the ears, pain when urinating, stomach cramps, and irregular heartbeats. People who take guarana regularly may experience caffeine withdrawal symptoms if they reduce their usual dose.

When taken by mouth or injected in very high doses, guarana is LIKELY UNSAFE and even deadly, due to its caffeine content. The fatal dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams. Serious poisoning can also occur at lower doses, depending on an individual's caffeine sensitivity or smoking behavior, age, and prior caffeine use.


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Guarana is POSSIBLY SAFE for pregnant and breast feeding women when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, guarana should be taken with caution due to the caffeine content. Small amounts are probably not harmful. However, taking guarana in high doses by mouth is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects.

In women who are nursing, caffeine passes into breast milk and can affect a nursing infant. Nursing mothers should closely monitor caffeine intake to make sure it is on the low side. High intake of caffeine by nursing mothers can cause sleep problems, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breast-fed infants.
Anxiety: The caffeine in guarana might make feelings of anxiety worse.
Bleeding disorders: There is some evidence suggesting that the caffeine in guarana might make bleeding disorders worse, although this has not been reported in people. If you have a bleeding disorder, check with your healthcare provider before starting guarana.
Diabetes: Some research suggests that the caffeine in guarana may affect the way people with diabetes process sugar (glucose) and may complicate blood sugar control. There is also some interesting research that suggests caffeine may enhance the warning symptoms of low blood sugar in patients with type 1 diabetes. Some studies show that the symptoms of low blood sugar are more intense when they start in the absence of caffeine, but as low blood sugar continues, symptoms are greater with caffeine. This might increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat low blood sugar. However, the downside is that caffeine might actually increase the number of low-sugar episodes. If you have diabetes, talk with your healthcare provider before starting guarana.
 Diarrhea. Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Seizures. Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might increase the risk of seizures and reduce the benefits of many medications used to control seizures. If you have seizures, talk to your healthcare provider before using guarana.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen the diarrhea some people have with IBS.
Heart disease: The caffeine in guarana might cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. Use with caution.
High blood pressure: Taking guarana might raise blood pressure, in people with high blood pressure due to its caffeine content. However, this effect might be less in people who are regular coffee-drinkers or otherwise use caffeine on a regular basis.
Glaucoma: The caffeine in guarana increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes after drinking caffeinated beverages.
Bladder control problems (Incontinence): Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might reduce bladder control, especially in older women. If you need to urinate often with high urgency, use guarana cautiously.
Osteoporosis: The caffeine in guarana can flush calcium out of the body through the kidneys. This calcium loss might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't consume more than 300 mg of caffeine per day. Taking calcium supplements may also help to replace any lost calcium.

Gymnema is a woody climbing shrub native to India and Africa. The leaves are used to make medicine. Gymnema has a long history of use in India's Ayurvedic medicine. The Hindi name for gymnema means ""destroyer of sugar.""

People use gymnema for diabetes, weight loss, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for GYMNEMA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Diabetes. Early research shows that taking gymnema by mouth along with insulin or diabetes medications can improve blood sugar control in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
Metabolic syndrome. Early research shows that taking gymnema for 12 weeks can reduce body weight and body mass index in overweight people with metabolic syndrome. But gymnema does not appear to help with blood sugar control or improve cholesterol levels in these people.
Weight loss. Early research shows that taking gymnema for 12 weeks can reduce body weight and body mass index in some people who are overweight. Early research also shows that taking a combination of gymnema, hydroxycitric acid, and niacin-bound chromium by mouth can reduce body weight in people who are overweight or obese.
Cough.
Increasing urine excretion (diuretic).
Malaria.
Metabolic syndrome.
Snake bites.
Softening the stool (laxative).
Stimulating digestion.

More evidence is needed to rate gymnema for these uses.","Gymnema contains substances that decrease the absorption of sugar from the intestine. Gymnema may also increase the amount of insulin in the body and increase the growth of cells in the pancreas, which is the place in the body where insulin is made.","Gymnema is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately for up to 20 months.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking gymnema if you are pregnant or breast feeding.  Stay on the safe side and avoid use. 
Diabetes: Gymnema can lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes and use gymnema.
Surgery: Gymnema might affect blood sugar levels and could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgical procedures. Stop using gymnema at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/841.html,"Vaghela M, Iyer K, Pandita N.

Hibiscus is a plant. The flowers and other parts of the plant are used to make medicine.

People use hibiscus for conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increasing the production of breast milk, infections, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. ","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for HIBISCUS are as follows:Possibly effective for...High blood pressure. Most early research shows that drinking hibiscus tea for 2-6 weeks decreases blood pressure by a small amount in people with normal or slightly high blood pressure. Some early research shows that drinking hibiscus tea might be as effective as the prescription drugs captopril and more effective than the drug hydrochlorothiazide for reducing blood pressure in people with slightly high blood pressure.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Abnormal cholesterol levels. Some early research shows that drinking hibiscus tea or taking hibiscus extract by mouth can lower levels of cholesterol and other blood fats in people with metabolic disorders such as diabetes. However, other research shows that hibiscus does not improve cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol.
Bladder infections (urinary tract infections). Early research has found that people with urinary catheters living in long-term care facilities who drink hibiscus tea have a 36% lower chance of having a urinary tract infection compared to those not drinking tea.
Weight loss. Early research shows that taking a product containing lemon verbena and hibiscus might help overweight and obese women feel less hungry and lose weight.
Colds.
Constipation.
Fluid retention.
Heart disease.
Irritated stomach.
Loss of appetite.
Nerve disease.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate hibiscus for these uses.","The fruit acids in hibiscus may work like a laxative. Some researchers think that other chemicals in hibiscus might be able to lower blood pressure; reduce levels of sugar and fats in the blood; decrease spasms in the stomach, intestines, and uterus; reduce swelling; and work like antibiotics to kill bacteria and worms.
","Hibiscus is LIKELY SAFE for most people in when consumed in food amounts. It is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately in medicinal amounts. The possible side effects of hibiscus are not known.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Hibiscus is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth as a medicine. Side effects of hibiscus are uncommon but might include temporary stomach upset or pain, gas, constipation, nausea, painful urination, headache, ringing in the ears, or shakiness.
Diabetes: Hibiscus might decrease blood sugar levels. The dose of your diabetes medications might need to be adjusted by your healthcare provider.
Low blood pressure: Hibiscus might lower blood pressure. In theory, taking hibiscus might make blood pressure become too low in people with low blood pressure.
Surgery: Hibiscus might affect blood sugar levels, making blood sugar control difficult during and after surgery. Stop using hibiscus at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Honey is a substance produced by bees from the nectar of plants. It is commonly used as a sweetener in food. It may also be used as a medicine.

Honey can become contaminated with germs from plants, bees, and dust during production, collection, and processing. Fortunately, there are characteristics of honey that prevent these germs from remaining alive or reproducing. However, some bacteria that reproduce using spores, such as the type that causes botulism, can remain. This explains why botulism has been reported in infants given honey by mouth. To solve this problem, medical-grade honey (Medihoney, for example) is irradiated to inactivate the bacterial spores. Medical-grade honey is also standardized to have consistent germ-fighting activity. Some experts also suggest that medical-grade honey should be collected from hives that are free from germs and not treated with antibiotics, and that the nectar should be from plants that have not been treated with pesticides.

Honey is used for cough, diabetes, high levels of cholesterol, painful periods, asthma, and hay fever. It is also used for diarrhea, ulcers in the mouth caused by cancer treatment, and stomach ulcers caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria. Honey is also used as a source of energy during vigorous exercise or in people who are malnourished. It may also be used orally for wound healing and pain following the removal of tonsils. 

Some people apply honey directly to the skin for acne, dry eyes, wound healing, burns, diabetic foot ulcers, gangrene, and many other uses.

Honey is used as a nasal spray for hay fever and sinus problems.

Honey is applied into the vagina to improve fertility.

In foods, honey is used as a sweetening agent.

In manufacturing, honey is used as a fragrance and a moisturizer in soaps and cosmetics.

Don't confuse honey with bee pollen, bee venom, and royal jelly.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for HONEY are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Burns. Applying honey preparations directly to burns seems to improve healing.
Cough. Taking a small amount of honey at bedtime appears to reduce the number of coughing spells in children age 2 years and older. Honey appears to be at least as effective as the cough suppressant dextromethorphan in typical over-the-counter doses. Also, drinking water containing a small amount of a honey/coffee paste seems to reduce the frequency of coughing in adults that have a long-lasting cough after they have been ill.
Diabetic foot ulcers. Most research shows that applying dressings containing honey to diabetic foot ulcers seems to reduce healing time and prevent the need for antibiotics. But not all research agrees.
Dry eyes. Using specific honey eye drops or eye gel in the eyes (Optimel Manuka plus eye drops or Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Gel) helps to make dry eyes feel better. These products can be used along with regular dry eye treatment such as lubricant drops and warm cloths on the eyes.
A skin condition that causes redness on the face (rosacea). Research shows that applying a topical honey product to the skin might improve symptoms of rosacea.
Mouth sores due to radiation or chemical treatment (mucositis). Rinsing the mouth and then slowly swallowing honey before and after radiation therapy sessions seems to reduce the risk of developing mouth sores. Also, applying honey to mouth sores or taking a honey/coffee paste seems to help heal mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy.
Wound healing. Applying honey preparations directly to wounds or using dressings containing honey seems to improve healing. Several small studies describe the use of honey or honey-soaked dressings for various types of wounds, including wounds after surgery, chronic leg ulcers, abscesses, burns, abrasions, cuts, and places where skin was taken for grafting. Honey seems to reduce odors and pus, help clean the wound, reduce infection, reduce pain, and decrease time to healing. In some reports, wounds healed with honey after other treatments failed to work.
Possibly ineffective for...
Acne. Research shows that applying honey to the face does not help to treat acne.
Sinus infections. Most research shows that using honey in a nasal spray does not help to reduce problems in people who have regular sinus infections. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hay fever. It is not clear if honey can help with symptoms of hay fever. Some early research shows that taking one tablespoon of honey daily, in addition to standard treatment, doesn't improve allergy symptoms. However, other early research shows that taking honey, in addition to standard treatment, might slightly improve certain symptoms such as itching in the nose and sneezing.
Athletic performance. Early research suggests that honey might improve blood levels following exercise and improve performance when given during exercise.
Infections caused by catheters used for kidney dialysis. Early research suggests that applying manuka honey (Medihoney by Medihoney Pty Ltd) to the exit sites of certain types of implanted hemodialysis catheters prevents infections from developing as effectively as certain antibiotics or antiseptics. However, other research suggests applying Manuka honey (Medihoney Antibacterial Wound Gel by Comvita) at the exit site does not reduce the occurrence of these infections. In fact, it might increase the risk of infection in people with diabetes.
Diabetes. Some early research shows that eating large doses of honey each day can decrease cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes. But it also seems to increase HbA1c, a measure of average blood sugar levels. Other early research shows that ingesting smaller amounts of honey each day can decrease fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels in people with type 1 diabetes.
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Early research shows that eating honey every day before starting a period helps to reduce pain once it starts. 
A type of gangrene around the genitals (Fournier's gangrene). Early research has shown unclear results about the effects of honey dressings, when used with antibiotics, as a treatment for this type of gangrene.
Gingivitis. Early research suggests that chewing ""leather"" made from manuka honey slightly reduces plaque and gum bleeding compared to sugarless chewing gum in people with gingivitis.
Hemorrhoids. Early research suggests that applying a spoonful of a mixture containing honey, olive oil, and beeswax reduces bleeding and itching caused by hemorrhoids.
Cold sores (herpes simplex). Early research suggests that applying a dressing soaked with honey four times daily improves symptoms and healing time of cold sores but not genital herpes..
High cholesterol. Some early research shows that taking 75 grams of honey per day for 14 days lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in women with high cholesterol. But other early research shows that taking 70 grams of honey per day for 30 days does not lower cholesterol levels in people with normal or high cholesterol levels.
""Stomach flu"". Some research shows that adding honey to a solution given to treat dehydration helps decrease vomiting and diarrhea, and can improve recovery in children and infants with stomach flu. However, another study shows that adding honey to a solution used to treat dehydration decreases diarrhea in only infants and children with stomach flu caused by bacteria but not those with stomach flu caused by a virus or other parasite.
Infertility. Early research suggests that applying a combination of Egyptian bee honey and royal jelly in the vagina increases pregnancy rates for couples having difficulty getting pregnant due to male infertility.
Skin infection caused by parasites (Leishmania lesions). Early research suggests that covering sores with honey-soaked dressings twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to medication injections results in slower healing than medications alone.
Poor nutrition. Early research suggests that honey improves weight and other symptoms in infants and children with poor nutrition.
Itching. Early research shows that applying a honey cream (Medihoney Barrier Cream by Derma Sciences Inc.) on the skin for 21 days can reduce itchy skin more than a zinc oxide ointment in people with skin irritation caused by rubbing.
Skin damage caused by radiation therapy (radiation dermatitis). Applying honey gauze once daily to severe skin wounds caused by radiation therapy does not seem to improve healing.
Asthma.
Breaking up thick mucus secretions.
Cataracts.
Digestive tract ulcers.
Sunburn.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of honey for these uses.","Some of the chemicals in honey may kill certain bacteria and fungus. When applied to the skin, honey may serve as a barrier to moisture and keep skin from sticking to dressings. Honey may also provide nutrients and other chemicals that speed wound healing.","Honey is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth or rinsed in the mouth, or when appropriately applied to the skin.

Honey is LIKELY UNSAFE when it is produced from the nectar of Rhododendrons and taken by mouth. This type of honey contains a toxin that may cause heart problems, low blood pressure, and chest pain.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Honey is LIKELY SAFE when taken in food amounts. The concern about botulism applies to infants and young children and not to adults or pregnant women. However, not enough is known about the safety of honey when used for medicinal purposes in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid medicinal amounts and topical applications.
Children: Honey is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in children one year of age and older. Honey is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in infants and very young children. Do not use raw honey in infants and young children under 12 months of age due to the chance of botulism poisoning. This is not a danger for older children or adults.
Diabetes: Using large amounts of honey might increase blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Also, applying honey at dialysis exit sites may increase the risk of infection in people with diabetes.
Pollen allergies: Avoid honey if you are allergic to pollen. Honey, which is made from pollen, may cause allergic reactions.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/738.html,"Lee VS, Humphreys IM, Purcell PL, Davis GE.

Hops are the dried, flowering part of the hop plant. They are commonly used in brewing beer and as flavoring components in foods. Hops are also used to make medicine.

Hops are commonly used orally for anxiety, sleep disorders such as the inability to sleep (insomnia) or disturbed sleep due to rotating or nighttime work hours (shift work disorder), restlessness, tension, excitability, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), nervousness, irritability, and symptoms of menopause among other uses. But there is limited scientific evidence to support using hopes for any of these conditions. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for HOPS are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Body odor. Early research suggests that applying a deodorant that contains hops, zinc salt, aloe leaf juice, witch hazel, chamomile, vitamin C, lemon grass, and other ingredients to the underarm can reduce body odor.
Insomnia. Taking hops along with other herbs and supplements may improve some aspects of sleep in people with insomnia, but research is mixed. Additionally, there is no evidence that taking hops by itself helps with insomnia. Some research suggests that taking a combination of hops extract plus valerian extract at bedtime helps some people fall asleep faster. It appears to take 28 days of treatment to see these benefits. Also, taking a combination of valerian extract and hops extract seems to improve sleep quality similarly to bromazepam (Lexotanil) when taken for only 14 days. In addition, taking a specific combination product containing valerian extract, passionflower extract, and hops extract daily at bedtime for 2 weeks seems to increase total sleep time by 2.5 hours, decrease the number of nighttime awakenings by 50%, and reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep by about one hour compared in patients with mild insomnia. These improvements are similar to the effects of the sedative zolpidem. However, other research suggests that taking a combination of hops, soya oil, soya lecithin, and Cannabis sativa for one month does not improve sleep quality. Other early research suggests that taking a combination of hops and valerian doesn’t improve the time it takes to fall asleep.
Menopausal symptoms. Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing hops extract daily does not improve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes after 8-12 weeks of treatment.
Sleep disorder due to rotating or night shifts (shift work disorder). Early research suggests that drinking non-alcoholic beer containing hops at dinner for two weeks can reduce the amount of time it takes to fall asleep by about 8 minutes in nurses working rotating or night shifts. It also seems to decrease total activity during the night and anxiety. However, it doesn’t appear to increase the total amount of time slept.
Leg ulcers. Early research suggests that applying a cream containing bladderwrack, English ivy, horse chestnut, gotu kola, butcher’s broom, horsetail, and hops, together with compression therapy, might help decrease pain and inflammation in people with leg ulcers and poor blood circulation in the legs.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of hops for these uses.","The chemicals in hops seem to have weak effects similar to the hormone estrogen. Some chemicals in hops also seem to reduce swelling, prevent infections, and cause sleepiness.","Hops are considered LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods.
Hops are POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for medicinal uses, short-term.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking hops if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Depression: Hops may make depression worse. Avoid use.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Some chemicals in hops act like the hormone estrogen. People who have conditions that are sensitive to hormones should avoid hops. Some of these conditions including breast cancer and endometriosis.
Surgery: Hops might cause too much sleepiness when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking hops at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/856.html,"Chadwick LR, Pauli GF, Farnsworth NR. The pharmacognosy of Humulus lupulus L.

Horny goat weed is an herb. The leaves are used to make medicine. As many as 15 horny goat weed species are known as ""yin yang huo"" in Chinese medicine.

Horny goat weed is commonly used by mouth for sexual performance problems, such as erectile dysfunction (ED) and low sexual desire. It is also used for weak back and knees, joint pain, arthritis, mental and physical fatigue, and memory loss along with many other conditions. But there is limited scientific research to support any of these uses.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for HORNY GOAT WEED are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Osteoporosis. Taking a specific extract of horny goat weed for 24 months in combination with calcium supplements decreases bone loss of the spine and hip in women who have passed menopause better than taking calcium alone. Chemicals in the extract act somewhat like the hormone estrogen.
Postmenopausal conditions.Taking horny goat weed water extract for 6 months can decrease cholesterol and increase estrogen levels in postmenopausal women.
Bronchitis.
Ejaculation problems.
Erectile dysfunction (ED).
Fatigue.
Heart disease.
High blood pressure.
HIV/AIDS.
Joint pain.
Liver disease.
Memory loss.
Sexual problems.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate horny goat weed for these uses.","Horny goat weed contains chemicals which might help increase blood flow and improve sexual function. It also contains phytoestrogens, chemicals that act somewhat like the female hormone estrogen. This might reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women.","Horny goat weed extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth, appropriately. A specific extract of horny goat weed containing phytoestrogens has been taken by mouth safely for up to 2 years. Also, a different extract of horny goat weed containing icariin has been taken by mouth safely for up to 6 months.

However, some types of horny goat weed are POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used for a long period of time or in high doses. Long-term use of these other forms of horny goat weed might cause dizziness, vomiting, dry mouth, thirst, and nosebleed. Taking large amounts of horny goat weed might cause spasms and severe breathing problems.

A heart rhythm problem has also been reported in one man who took horny goat weed in a commercial product used for sexual enhancement. A specific multi-ingredient commercial product (Enzyte, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals) that contains horny goat weed might cause abnormal heart beats. These changes might increase the chance of having a heart rhythm problems. A case of liver toxicity has been reported in a man who took this same product (Enzyte, Berkeley Premium Nutraceuticals). However, since this product contains multiple ingredients, it is not clear if these effects are caused by horny goat weed or other ingredients. In the case of liver toxicity, it's possible that the side effect was an abnormal reaction that would be unlikely to occur in other patients.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Horny goat weed is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. There is a concern that it might harm the developing fetus. Avoid using it. Not enough it known about the safety of using horny goat weed during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid using.
Bleeding disorders: Horny goat weed might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bleeding. In theory, taking horny goat weed might make bleeding disorders worse.
Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Horny goat weed acts like estrogen and can increase estrogen levels in some women. Horny goat weed might make estrogen-sensitive conditions, such as breast and uterine cancer, worse.
Low blood pressure: Horny goat weed might lower blood pressure. In people who already have low blood pressure, using horny goat weed might drop blood pressure too low and increase the risk of fainting.
Surgery: Horny goat weed might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Stop taking horny goat weed at least 2 weeks before surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/699.html,"Indran IR, Liang RL, Min TE, Yong EL.

It contains a chemical called thiaminase, which breaks down the vitamin thiamine. In theory, this effect could lead to thiamine deficiency. Some products are labeled ""thiaminase-free,"" but there is not enough information available to know if these products are safe. 
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking horsetail if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Alcoholism: People who are alcoholics are generally also thiamine deficient. Taking horsetail might make thiamine deficiency worse.
Allergies to carrots and nicotine: Some people with allergy to carrot might also have allergy to horsetail. Horsetail also contains small amounts of nicotine. People with nicotine allergy might have an allergic reaction to horsetail.
Diabetes: Horsetail might lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes and use horsetail.
Low potassium levels (hypokalemia): There is some concern that horsetail might flush potassium out of the body, possibly leading to potassium levels that are too low. Until more is known, use horsetail with caution if you are at risk for potassium deficiency.
Low thiamine levels (thiamine deficiency): Taking horsetail might make thiamine deficiency worse.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/843.html,"Radojevic ID, Stankovic MS, Stefanovic OD, Topuzovic MD, Comic LR, Ostojic AM.

Iodine is a chemical element. The body needs iodine but cannot make it. The iodine needed by the body must come from the diet. As a rule, there is very little iodine in food, unless it has been added during processing. Processed food typically contains more iodine due to the addition of iodized salt. Most of the world's iodine is found in the ocean, where it is concentrated by sea life, especially seaweed.

The thyroid gland needs iodine to make hormones. If the thyroid doesn't have enough iodine to do its job, systems in the body cause the thyroid to work harder. This can cause an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), which causes a swollen neck.

Other consequences of not having enough iodine (iodine deficiency) are also serious. Iodine deficiency and the resulting low levels of thyroid hormone can cause women to stop ovulating, leading to infertility. Iodine deficiency can also lead to an autoimmune disease of the thyroid and may increase the risk of getting thyroid cancer. Some researchers think that iodine deficiency might also increase the risk of other cancers such as prostate, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.

Iodine deficiency during pregnancy is serious for both the mother and the baby. It can lead to high blood pressure during pregnancy for the mother and mental retardation for the baby. Iodine plays an important role in development of the central nervous system. In extreme cases, iodine deficiency can lead to cretinism, a disorder that involves severely stunted physical and mental growth.

Iodine deficiency is a common world health problem. The most recognized form of deficiency is goiter. Additionally, across the globe iodine deficiency is thought to be the most common preventable cause of mental retardation. Early in the twentieth century, iodine deficiency was common in the US and Canada, but the addition of iodine to salt has improved public health. The addition of iodine to salt is required in Canada. In the  US, iodized salt is not required, but it is widely available. Researchers estimate that iodized salt is used regularly by about half the US population.

Iodine is taken by mouth to prevent and treat iodine deficiency and its consequences, including goiter and some thyroid disorders. It is also used for treating lumpy breasts (fibrocystic breast disease) and breast pain (mastalgia).

Iodine is also used for radiation emergencies, to protect the thyroid gland against radioactive iodides. Potassium iodide tablets for use in a radiation emergency are available as FDA-approved products (ThyroShield, Iosat) and on the Internet as food supplements. Potassium iodide should only be used in a radiation emergency, not in advance of an emergency to prevent sickness.

Iodine is sometimes applied to the skin for skin inflammation and to kill germs and heal wounds, to prevent soreness inside the mouth or along the digestive tract (mucositis), and to treat diabetic and other external ulcers. Iodine is also applied inside the mouth to treat gum disease and reduce bleeding after the removal of a tooth.

Iodine is used in the eyes to reduce swelling in infants and to prevent vision loss in patients with ulcers of the cornea.
  
Iodine is used in the vagina to prevent post-Cesarean swelling of the lining of the uterus.
 

Iodine is also used for water purification.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for IODINE are as follows:Likely effective for...Iodine deficiency. Taking iodine supplements, including iodized salt, is effective for preventing and treating iodine deficiencies.
Radiation exposure. Taking iodine by mouth is effective for protecting against exposure to radioactive iodides in a radiation emergency. However, it should not be used for general protection against radiation.
Thyroid conditions. Taking iodine by mouth can improve thyroid storm and lumps on the thyroid called thyroid nodules.
Leg ulcers. Applying iodine in the form of cadexomer iodine or povidone-iodine to venous leg ulcers along with compression therapy seems help heal leg ulcers and reduce the chance of a future infection.
Possibly effective for...Conjunctivitis (pinkeye). Research suggests that using eye drops containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine is more effective than silver nitrate for decreasing the risk of pinkeye in newborns. However, it is not more effective than the medications erythromycin or chloramphenicol.
Foot ulcers in diabetes. Applying iodine to foot ulcers might be beneficial for people with foot ulcers related to diabetes.
Inflammation of the uterus (endometritis). Washing the vagina with a solution containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before a Cesarean delivery reduces the risk of the inflammation of the uterus.
Painful fibrous breast tissue (fibrocystic breast disease). Research shows that taking iodine, especially molecular iodine, reduces painful fibrous breast tissue.
Breast pain (mastalgia). Taking 3000-6000 mg of molecular iodine for 5 months seems to reduce pain and tenderness in women with breast pain related to their menstrual cycle. However, taking lower doses of 1500 mg daily doesn't seem to work.
Soreness and swelling inside the mouth. Applying iodine to the skin seems to prevent soreness and swelling inside the mouth caused by chemotherapy.
Gum infection (periodontitis). Research suggests that rinsing with a solution containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine during non-surgical treatments for gum infections can help reduce the depth of infected gum pockets.
Surgery. Some research suggests that applying iodine in the form of povidone-iodine before or during surgery reduces the risk of infections. However, conflicting results exist. Also, povidone-iodine seems to be less effective than chlorhexidine at preventing infections at the surgical site when used before surgery.
Possibly ineffective for...
Catheter-related infection. Some evidence suggests that applying povidone-iodine reduces the risk of blood stream infections for people with hemodialysis catheters. However, most research suggests that applying povidone-iodine where a catheter is inserted does not reduce the risk of infection associated with using other types of catheters.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Bleeding.Early research suggests that washing the tooth socket with a rinse containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine stops bleeding in more patients after having a tooth pulled compared to saline.
Chyle in the urine (chyluria). Chyluria is a condition in which chyle is present in the urine stream. This causes the urine to appear milky white. Early research suggests that injecting iodine in the form of povidine-iodine into a particular region of the pelvis helps treat and prevent the recurrence of chyluria.
Eye infection (corneal ulceration). Early research suggests that using eye drops containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine along with antibiotic therapy does not improve vision in people with corneal ulcers better than using antibiotics alone.
Fungal skin condition (Cutaneous sporotrichosis). Saturated solution of potassium iodide is commonly used for cutaneous sporotrichosis. There are reports that taking potassium iodide by mouth alone or with another antifungal treatment is effective for most people with cutaneous sporotrichosis.
Pneumonia. Early research suggests that rinsing the throat with iodine in the form of povidone-iodine decreases the risk of pneumonia in people with severe head trauma who are using a ventilator.
Wound healing. There is some interest in using iodine agents to promote wound healing. While there is some evidence that applying iodine to wounds is more effective than non-antiseptic dressings in reducing wound size, iodine seems to be less effective than antibiotics.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of iodine for these uses.","Iodine reduces thyroid hormone and can kill fungus, bacteria, and other microorganisms such as amoebas. A specific kind of iodine called potassium iodide is also used to prevent thyroid damage after a radioactive accident.","Iodine is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth at recommended amounts or when applied to the skin appropriately using approved products.

Iodine can cause side effects in some people. Common side effects include nausea and stomach pain, runny nose, headache, metallic taste, and diarrhea.

In sensitive people, iodine can cause side effects including swelling of the lips and face (angioedema), severe bleeding and bruising, fever, joint pain, lymph node enlargement, hives, and death. However, such sensitivity is very rare.


Large amounts or long-term use of iodine are POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Adults should avoid prolonged use of doses higher than 1100 mcg per day (the upper tolerable limit, UL) without proper medical supervision. In children, doses should not exceed 200 mcg per day for children 1 to 3 years old, 300 mcg per day for children 4 to 8 years old, 600 mcg per day for children 9 to 13 years old, and 900 mcg per day for adolescents. These are the upper tolerable limits (UL).

In both children and adults, there is concern that higher intake can increase the risk of side effects such as thyroid problems. Iodine in larger amounts can cause metallic taste, soreness of teeth and gums, burning in mouth and throat, increased saliva, throat inflammation, stomach upset, diarrhea, wasting, depression, skin problems, and many other side effects.

When iodine is used directly on the skin, it can cause skin irritation, stains, allergic reactions, and other side effects. Be careful not to bandage or tightly cover areas that have been treated with iodine to avoid iodine burn.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Iodine needs increase during pregnancy. Iodine is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in recommended amounts or when applied to the skin appropriately using an approved product (2% solution). Iodine is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in high doses. Do not take more than 1100 mcg of iodine per day if you are over 18 years old; do not take more than 900 mcg of iodine per day if you are 14 to 18 years old. Higher intake has been shown to cause thyroid problems in the newborn in some cases.
Autoimmune thyroid disease: People with autoimmune thyroid disease may be especially sensitive to the harmful side effects of iodine.
A type of rash called dermatitis herpetiformis: Taking iodine can cause worsening of this rash.
Thyroid disorders, such as too little thyroid function (hypothyroidism), an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), or a thyroid tumor: Prolonged use or high doses of iodine might make these conditions worse.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/35.html,"Gowachirapant S, Jaiswal N, Melse-Boonstra A, et al.

Lactobacillus is a type of bacteria. There are lots of different species of lactobacillus. These are ""friendly"" bacteria that normally live in our digestive, urinary, and genital systems without causing disease. Lactobacillus is also in some fermented foods like yogurt and in dietary supplements.

Lactobacillus is taken by mouth to treat and prevent diarrhea, including infectious types such as rotaviral diarrhea in children and traveler's diarrhea. It is also taken to prevent and treat diarrhea linked with using antibiotics.

Some people take lactobacillus by mouth for general digestion problems, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colic in babies, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammation of the colon, too much bacterial growth in the intestines, constipation, to improve outcomes after bowel surgery, and to prevent a serious gut problem called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in babies born prematurely. Lactobacillus is also taken by mouth for infection with Helicobacter pylori, the type of bacteria that causes ulcers, and also for other types of infections including urinary tract infections (UTIs), vaginal yeast infections, to prevent the common cold and flu, to prevent and treat diabetes during pregnancy, to prevent ear infections in children, and to prevent respiratory infections in healthy children and adults, in athletes, and in children with cystic fibrosis. It is also taken by mouth for weight loss, eye fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, dental cavities, dental plaque, gum disease, and mouth sores. It is also being tested to prevent serious infections in people on ventilators.

Lactobacillus is taken by mouth for skin disorders such as fever blisters, canker sores, and acne. It is also used to treat or prevent eczema (allergic dermatitis), sensitivity to sun exposure (polymorphous light eruption), sensitivity to environmental allergens, and hay fever in infants and children.

It is also taken by mouth for high cholesterol, swine flu, HIV/AIDS, lactose intolerance, Lyme disease, hives, to prevent cancer, and to boost the immune system.

Women sometimes use lactobacillus suppositories to treat vaginal infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs).
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for LACTOBACILLUS are as follows:Possibly effective for...Hayfever. Taking 2 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus daily for 5 weeks can improve quality of life by almost 18% in people with grass pollen allergy that doesn't respond to the anti-allergy drug loratadine. In children with allergies that persist throughout the year, taking 10 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus for 12 weeks seems to improve itchy eye symptoms. But taking lactobacillus during pregnancy doesn't seem to prevent the infant from developing allergies. 
Preventing diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Taking probiotics products containing lactobacillus strains helps prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in adults and children. The most well-studied strain of lactobacillus seems to reduce the chance of diarrhea by about 60% to 70% when started within 2 days of beginning antibiotic treatment and continued for at least 3 days after finishing the antibiotics.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Most research shows that taking lactobacillus products can reduce eczema symptoms in infants and children. Research also shows that lactobacillus can help PREVENT eczema from developing. When taken by a mother during the last month of pregnancy, lactobacillus probiotics can reduce the chance of the child developing eczema. But not all strains seem to work.
A condition associated with an increased risk for developing allergic reactions (atopic disease). Research shows that taking certain lactobacillus strains can prevent the development of allergic reactions, such as asthma, runny nose, and eczema, in infants with a family history of this condition. However, not all strains seem to work.
Treating vaginal infections caused by bacteria (bacterial vaginosis). Researchers have found that lactobacillus suppositories and vaginal tablets may be effective in treating bacterial vaginosis. Researchers have also found that eating yogurt or using vaginal capsules containing lactobacillus can help prevent these infections from occurring again.
Preventing diarrhea due to cancer treatment (chemotherapy). A chemotherapy drug called 5-fluorouracil can cause severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. There is some evidence that patients with cancer of the colon or rectum have less severe diarrhea, less stomach discomfort, and shorter hospital care when they take lactobacillus.
Constipation. Taking lactobacillus probiotics for 4-8 weeks can reduce symptoms of constipation including stomach pain and discomfort, bloating, and incomplete bowel movements. It might also increase the number of bowel movements in some people.
Diabetes. Taking lactobacillus starting at the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy helps to prevent diabetes during pregnancy, especially in mothers over 35 years of age and mothers that had diabetes during another pregnancy. In women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, taking lactobacillus seems to help control blood sugar.
Diarrhea. Giving lactobacillus to infants and children 1-36 months old when they are admitted to the hospital seems to reduce the risk of developing diarrhea. Also, lactobacillus can reduce the risk of diarrhea from all causes in undernourished children. But most research shows that giving lactobacillus to children who already have diarrhea does not help them to get better faster.
Stomach pain. Most research shows that taking lactobacillus short-term can help to reduce symptoms in children with stomach pain. Early research also shows that taking lactobacillus and bifidobacterium short-term can improve symptoms in women with stomach pain.
Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection. Research shows that taking lactobacillus probiotics along with ""triple therapy"" that consists of the prescription drugs clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and a proton-pump inhibitor helps treat stomach ulcers caused by H. pylori. About 7-11 patients with H. pylori infections need to be treated with lactobacillus plus ""triple therapy"" for one additional patient to achieve remission compared to what would be achieved with ""triple therapy"" alone. But taking lactobacillus probiotics does not help treat the infection when taken alone, with only an antibiotic, with other ""triple therapies,"" or with ""quadruple therapy"" that includes bismuth.
High cholesterol. Taking lactobacillus probiotics can lower total cholesterol by about 10 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol by about 9 mg/dL in people with or without high cholesterol. However, lactobacillus probiotics do not seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol or fats called triglycerides.
Colic in babies. Some research shows that giving lactobacillus to nursing infants reduces daily crying time. Some research suggests that lactobacillus is more effective at reducing crying time than using the drug simethicone. But one large study shows that lactobacillus does not reduce crying. It's possible that infants in the large study had more severe colic than those in the earlier research.
Inflamed mouth sores from cancer treatment (oral mucositis). Research shows that taking lozenges containing lactobacillus from the first day of radiation/chemotherapy treatment until one week after reduces the number of patients who develop severe mouth sores.
A complication from surgery for ulcerative colitis (pouchitis). Taking lactobacillus by mouth seems to help treat pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Taking a probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus for one year seems to maintain remission in 85% of people with this condition. Taking a different formulation containing two lactobacillus species and bifidobacterium for 9 months seems to reduce pouchitis severity.
Airway infections. Some research shows that lactobacillus probiotics can help prevent airway infections in infants and children. Giving lactobacillus to infants and children seems to reduce the chance of upper airway infections. Also, children ages 1-6 years who attend daycare centers seem to get fewer and less severe airway infections when given milk containing lactobacillus. However, not all strains seem to work. In adults, drinking fermented milk that contains lactobacillus might help prevent airway infections and decrease how long the infections last.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Research shows that taking lactobacillus for 8 weeks reduces tender and swollen joints in women with rheumatoid arthritis.
Traveler's diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea is caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that the traveler has not been exposed to before. Taking lactobacillus seems to help prevent diarrhea in travelers. The effectiveness can vary a lot depending on the travel destination because of differences in bacteria in different locations.
A bowel condition called ulcerative colitis. Lactobacillus probiotics seem to increase remission in people with ulcerative colitis. The best evidence of benefit is for a multi-species probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus. Research shows that taking this product can increase remission rates by almost 2-fold when used with standard ulcerative colitis treatment. Taking a single strain of lactobacillus also seems to improve symptoms. But lactobacillus doesn't seem to prevent ulcerative colitis relapse.Possibly ineffective for...Diarrhea caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile. People who are treated for Clostridium difficile infections often experience recurrence. Although some conflicting results exist, most research shows that taking lactobacillus does not prevent recurrent episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. Most research also shows that lactobacillus probiotics do not prevent first episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhea.
Crohn's disease. Taking lactobacillus probiotics does not prevent Crohn's disease from becoming active again in people who are in remission or in those who have just had surgery for Crohn's disease.
Dental plaque. Giving lactobacillus to pregnant women starting 4 weeks before delivery until birth, and then continuing in the infants until 12 months of age, does not seem to reduce dental plaque in the baby teeth of the child by the age of 9 years.
Exercise-induced respiratory infections. Research in trained athletes shows that taking lactobacillus probiotics does not reduce the risk of developing a respiratory infection. It also does not seem reduce the symptoms of respiratory infections in athletes.
Vaginal yeast infections. Taking lactobacillus by mouth or eating yogurt enriched with lactobacillus doesn't prevent vaginal yeast infections in women that have used antibiotics. However, symptoms seem to improve if vaginal suppositories containing lactobacillus are used along with conventional treatment.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Acne. Early research shows that taking a probiotic containing lactobacillus and bifidobacterium along with minocycline improves acne.
Eye strain. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus does not reduce the strain on the eyes caused by monitors and screens. However, in some people who already have a lot of strain on the eyes, taking lactobacillus might help to reduce additional strain and redness.
Bipolar disorder. Taking a probiotic containing lactobacillus and bifidobacterium after being discharged from the hospital might reduce the chance that people with bipolar disorder will need to be readmitted due to worsening of symptoms.
Common cold. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus daily for 12 weeks reduces the risk of common cold by about 12% and reduces the number of days with symptoms from 8.6 to 6.2 in adults. Also, taking lactobacillus plus bifidobacterium for 3 months seems to reduce school absences due to cold symptoms. However, research is inconsistent. Taking some lactobacillus strains does not seem to reduce the risk of catching a cold or the number of cold/flu days.
Cystic fibrosis. Research suggests that taking lactobacillus daily for 6 months reduces the percentage of cystic fibrosis patients with lung complications from 37% to 3% and the percentage with upper respiratory tract infections from 20% to 3%.
Cavities. Giving lactobacillus to pregnant women starting 4 weeks before delivery until birth, and then continuing in the infants until 12 months of age, helps to prevent cavities in the child's baby teeth. But giving lactobacillus to infants does not prevent cavities in teeth. 
Flu. Taking a drink containing one strain of lactobacillus 5 days weekly for 8 weeks reduces the incidence of the flu in schoolchildren during flu season. Taking a different lactobacillus strain daily for 6 weeks does not reduce the number of cold/flu days in otherwise healthy adults.
Treating irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Many studies have evaluated lactobacillus species for treating IBS. Some strains might reduce IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and gas in some people. But other lactobacillus strains don't seem to work in most people with IBS.
Trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. Some research shows that drinking milk with lactobacillus still causes symptoms, like gas, in people with lactose intolerance. But other research shows that drinking a milk product containing lactobacillus reduces symptoms of lactose intolerance.
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in babies born prematurely. When results from multiple clinical studies are evaluated, giving lactobacillus to preterm infants seems to reduce the risk of severe NEC by 30% to 55%. But when results from individual clinical studies are considered, lactobacillus does not seem to prevent NEC. It's possible that the individual clinical studies are too small to show benefit. It's also possible that lactobacillus may be more beneficial when used along with other probiotics than when used as a single probiotic.
Skin rash caused by sun exposure (polymorphous light eruption). Early research shows that taking a supplement containing lactobacillus and other ingredients reduces how severe skin reactions are after sun exposure in people with a disorder called polymorphous light eruption.
Diarrhea in children caused by a certain virus (rotaviral diarrhea). Some small studies show that certain lactobacillus strains can help some children with rotaviral diarrhea get over their diarrhea up to 3 days sooner. But other research shows that giving lactobacillus to children with rotaviral diarrhea does not help them to get better faster. More research is needed to understand which strains, if any, can help with this condition. Also, more research is needed to determine if lactobacillus has different effects in children who have been given rotavirus vaccine compared with those who have not.
Growth of bacteria in the intestines. Some clinical research has evaluated lactobacillus for treating and preventing the growth of potentially harmful bacteria in the intestines. Some of this research shows slight improvements in symptoms such as stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea. But other research has found no benefit in people with this condition. Lactobacillus does not seem to be helpful for preventing growth of harmful bacteria in the intestines.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs). There is some early evidence that taking lactobacillus by mouth or putting it on the vagina might be helpful for preventing UTIs. However, not all strains seem to work, and not all studies agree.
Pneumonia in people on breathing machines in the hospital. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus might reduce the incidence of pneumonia in people in the intensive care unit.
Weight loss. Research shows that taking lactobacillus does not reduce fat or weight in most obese adults. However, it might reduce body weight in women.
Boosting the immune system.
Cancer.
Canker sores.
Fever blisters.
Hives.
Lyme disease.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate lactobacillus for these uses.","Many bacteria and other organisms live in our bodies normally. ""Friendly"" bacteria such as Lactobacillus can help us break down food, absorb nutrients, and fight off ""unfriendly"" organisms that might cause diseases such as diarrhea.","Lactobacillus is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Side effects are usually mild and most often include intestinal gas or bloating.

Lactobacillus is also LIKELY SAFE for women to use inside the vagina.

Special precautions & warnings:
Children: Lactobacillus is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately in children.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Lactobacillus is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately while pregnant and breastfeeding.
Weakened immune system: There is some concern that lactobacillus from supplements that contain live bacteria might grow too well in people whose immune systems are weakened. This includes people with HIV/AIDS or people who have taken medicines to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ. Lactobacillus has caused disease (rarely) in people with weakened immune systems. To be on the safe side, if you have a weakened immune system, talk with your healthcare provider before taking lactobacillus.
Short bowel syndrome: People with short bowel syndrome might be more likely than other people to develop lactobacillus infections. If you have this condition, talk with your healthcare provider before taking lactobacillus.
Ulcerative colitis: People with ulcerative colitis that is severe enough to require hospitalization might be more likely than other people to develop lactobacillus infections. If you have this condition, talk with your healthcare provider before taking lactobacillus.
Damaged heart valves: Lactobacillus can cause an infection in the inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valve, but this is extremely rare. However, people with damaged heart valves might be more likely than other people to develop this type of infection, especially if they take lactobacillus before dental or invasive stomach and intestinal procedures. People with damaged heart valves should stop taking probiotics before dental procedures or invasive stomach and intestinal procedures such as an endoscopy.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/790.html,"World Gastroenterology Organisation.

L-arginine is a chemical building block called ""an amino acid."" It is obtained from the diet and is necessary for the body to make proteins. L-arginine is found in red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. It can also be made in a laboratory and used as medicine.

L-arginine is most commonly used for recovery after surgery, a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia), and heart and blood vessel conditions, such as chest pain (angina) and high blood pressure. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for L-ARGININE are as follows:Possibly effective for...Chest pain (angina). Taking L-arginine seems to decrease symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in people with angina. However, L-arginine does not seem to help widen the blood vessels that are narrowed in angina.
Erectile dysfunction (ED). Taking 5 grams of L-arginine by mouth daily seems to improve sexual function in men with ED. Taking lower doses might not be effective. However, there is some early evidence that taking L-arginine with maritime pine bark extract and other ingredients, might improve the effectiveness of low-dose L-arginine for ED.
High blood pressure. There is evidence that taking L-arginine by mouth can reduce blood pressure in healthy people, people with high blood pressure, and people with slightly high blood pressure with or without diabetes.
A serious intestinal disease in premature infants (necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC). Adding L-arginine to formula seems to prevent inflammation of the digestive tract in premature infants. A total of 6 premature infants need to receive arginine to prevent one instance of digestive tract inflammation.
Narrowing of blood vessels that causes poor blood flow to the limbs (peripheral arterial disease). Research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or intravenously (by IV) for up to 8 weeks increases blood flow in people with peripheral arterial disease. However, long-term use (up to 6 months) does not improve walking speed or distance in these same people.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Most research shows that L-arginine can reduce blood pressure in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia. L-arginine also seems to keep pregnant women from developing pre-eclampsia.
Possibly ineffective for...Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Most early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth or intravenously (by IV) does not improve kidney function in most people with kidney failure or kidney disease. However, taking L-arginine by mouth might improve kidney function and reverse anemia in elderly people with kidney disease-associated anemia.
Heart attack. Taking L-arginine does not seem to help prevent a heart attack. It also does not seem to be beneficial for treating a heart attack after it has occurred. In fact, there is concern that L-arginine might be harmful for people after a recent heart attack. Do not take L-arginine if you have had a recent heart attack.
Tuberculosis. Adding arginine to standard treatment for tuberculosis does not seem to help improve symptoms or clear the infection.
Wound healing. Taking L-arginine does not seem to improve wound healing.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Altitude sickness. Early research suggests that L-arginine does not reduce altitude sickness.
Small tears in the lining of the anus (anal fissures). There is inconsistent evidence about that effects of L-arginine for treating anal fissures. Applying a topical gel containing L-arginine for at least 12 weeks might heal anal fissures in people who do not respond to traditional care. However, applying L-arginine to the skin does not seem to be better than surgery for anal fissures.
Athletic performance. There is inconsistent evidence about the effects of L-arginine on athletic performance. L-arginine might help people exercise longer, but it does not seem to help make people stronger. Some evidence shows that taking L-arginine increases the time a person can exercise before becoming tired and helps the lungs work more efficiently. However, taking L-arginine does not affect strength during exercise.
Breast cancer. Early research shows that taking L-arginine before chemotherapy does not improve the response rate in people with breast cancer.
Heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or CHF). Taking L-arginine by mouth, together with conventional treatment, seems to improve kidney function in people with heart failure. But it doesn't seem to improve the ability to exercise. L-arginine should not be used in place of conventional treatment.
Surgery to improve blood flow to the heart (CABG surgery). There is mixed evidence about the effects of L-arginine in protecting the heart during CABG. Some research suggests that giving L-arginine intravenously (by IV) may be helpful in people undergoing CABG. Other research shows that it does not help.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine intravenously (by IV) before exercising can improve blood vessel function in people with heart disease. However, it does not improve blood flow to the heart.
Critical illness (trauma). Research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth with glutamine, nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids reduces the recovery time, the need for help with breathing, and risk of infections in people who are critically ill. However, it does not reduce the risk of death.
Cystic fibrosis. Early research shows that breathing in a solution containing L-arginine does not improve lung function any more than breathing in saline. 
Diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Early research suggests that L-arginine might improve memory loss related to aging.
Cavities. Early research suggests that using a sugarless mint containing an arginine complex (CaviStat) for one year reduces the number of cavities in molars of children compared with sugarless mints that do not contain arginine. Also, using a toothpaste containing arginine, calcium, and fluoride reduces cavity production by a small amount compared to toothpaste containing only fluoride.
Tooth sensitivity. Early research suggests that using a toothpaste containing arginine, calcium, and fluoride reduces tooth sensitivity when used twice daily.
Diabetes. Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to improve blood sugar control in people with existing diabetes. However, it is unclear if arginine helps prevent people with pre-diabetes from developing diabetes.
Foot sores in people with diabetes. Early research shows that applying L-arginine to the feet daily can improve circulation in people with diabetes, which might be helpful in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. However, if there is already an ulcer on the foot, injecting L-arginine under the skin near the ulcer does not seem to shorten healing time or lower the chance of needing an amputation in the future. Taking L-arginine by mouth with other amino acids doesn't seem to help foot ulcers heal better in most people with diabetes. But it might help people with diabetes who have low levels of protein in the blood or those with poor circulation to the feet.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Early research suggests that taking L-arginine daily for 3 months does not improve nerve damage related to diabetes.
Chest pain with no apparent cause (functional chest pain). Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth or as an infusion can reduces the number and intensity of chest pain attacks in people with chest pain that is not related to the heart.
Head and neck cancer. Supplementing a feeding tube with L-arginine does not seem to improve immune function, reduce tumor size, or improve healing in people with head and neck cancer.
Heart failure. Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or receiving L-arginine by IV does not seem to improve a person's ability to exercise, quality of life, or blood circulation. L-arginine should not be used in place of conventional treatment.
Complications after a heart transplant. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth for 6 weeks increases walking distance and improves breathing in people with a heart transplant.
Involuntary weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking L-arginine by mouth, along with hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) and glutamine, for 8 weeks, seems to increase body weight and improve immune function in people with HIV/AIDS. However, taking L-arginine by mouth, along with omega-3 fatty acids and a balanced nutritional supplement, for 6 months does not improve body weight or fat mass, energy intake, or immune function in people who are HIV-positive.
High cholesterol. Early research shows that taking L-arginine doesn't help to lower cholesterol levels.
Inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). Some early research suggests that taking 16 grams of L-arginine daily increases the number of eggs collected in women undergoing IVF. However, it does not seem to improve pregnancy rates. 
Painful bladder syndrome (interstitial cystitis). Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to reduce pain and some symptoms of bladder inflammation, although improvements may take 3 months to occur.  However, L-arginine does not seem to reduce the need to urinate at night or improve the frequency of urination.
Infants with birth weight below the 10th percentile due to inadequate nutrition. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine during pregnancy can increase the birthweight of babies who show poor growth while still in their mother's womb. However, L-arginine does not seem to increase birthweight or reduce the risk of the baby dying if the baby has extremely poor growth while in the womb.
Kidney transplant. There is conflicting evidence about the effects of L-arginine for people with kidney transplants. It is unclear if it helps.
Conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). Early research shows that taking L-arginine does not improve sperm function or count in men with unexplained infertility. However, taking L-arginine with maritime pine bark extract might help sperm move faster.
A group of disorders that most often cause muscle weakness (mitochondrial myopathies). There is some interest in using L-arginine to improve symptoms associated with MELAS. Early research suggests that administering L-arginine intravenously (by IV) soon after stroke-like symptoms improves headaches, nausea, vomiting, blindness, and the appearance of bright spots in the eyes. Some research also shows that taking L-arginine every day might reduce the risk of stroke-like symptoms. But not all research agrees.
Migraine. Taking L-arginine by mouth along with the painkiller ibuprofen seems to be effective for treating migraine headache. This combination sometimes starts to work within 30 minutes. However, it is hard to know how much of the pain relief is due to L-arginine, since ibuprofen can relieve migraine pain on its own.
A group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss (muscular dystrophy). Very early research suggests that taking L-arginine with a drug called metformin might help with muscle control and walking ability in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Reduced benefit of nitrate therapy that happens when nitrates are used all day (nitrate tolerance). Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to prevent tolerance in people who take nitroglycerin for chest pain.
Obesity. Early research suggests that taking a specific arginine supplement (NOW Foods, Bloomingdale, IL) 3 grams three times daily may decrease waist size and weight in women.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth along with other ingredients does not prevent sores in the mouth during cancer treatment.
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Early research suggests that taking N-acetyl-cysteine and L-arginine daily for 6 months can improve menstrual function and reduces insulin resistance in people with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Infection after surgery. Taking L-arginine with other compounds before surgery or after surgery seems to help reduce the number of infections after surgery. But L-arginine probably does not work when taken by itself. 
Recovery after surgery. Taking L-arginine with other compounds before surgery or after surgery seems to help reduce the recovery time after surgery. But L-arginine probably does not work when taken by itself.
Bed sores (pressure ulcers). Early research shows that taking L-arginine along with protein, vitamin C, and zinc, helps bed sores to heal faster. 
Skin damage caused by radiation therapy (radiation dermatitis). Early research shows that taking a combination of L-arginine and other amino acids during radiation treatment might help to prevent skin problems. But it doesn't seem to prevent the more serious skin problems in people given very high doses of radiation.
Re-narrowing of a blood vessel after stent placement or angioplasty (restenosis). Some research suggests that giving L-arginine during stent implantation followed by L-arginine supplementation by mouth for 2 weeks after stent implantation does not reduce the risk of restricted blood flow. However, other evidence suggests that administering L-arginine at the site of stent implantation may reduce artery wall thickening.
Infection of the airways. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth for 60 days prevents the recurrence of respiratory infections in children.
Schizophrenia. Early research shows that taking L-arginine does not help people with schizophrenia who are already using appropriate treatment.
Sexual problems that prevent satisfaction during sexual activity. Early research shows that taking a specific product containing L-arginine and other ingredients might improve low sexual desire in women with sexual problems who are taking contraceptive pills. It is unknown if taking L-arginine alone has any effect on female sexual problems.
Sickle-cell disease. Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or as an injection (by IV) for 5 days might be useful for adults with sickle cell disease who have high blood pressure in the lungs. L-arginine might also help to reduce the amount of pain medications needed to control pain in children who are in the hospital because of a  sickle cell attack (sickle cell crisis).
Stress. Some early research suggests that taking a combination of L-lysine and L-arginine for up to 10 days reduces stress and anxiety in healthy people and those prone to stress.
Toxic side effects caused by the drug valproic acid. Giving L-arginine intravenously (by IV) might reduce high levels of ammonia in the blood during treatment with valproic acid in some people.
Prevention of the common cold.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of L-arginine for these uses.
","L-arginine is converted in the body into a chemical called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide causes blood vessels to open wider for improved blood flow. L-arginine also stimulates the release of growth hormone, insulin, and other substances in the body.","When taken by mouth: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken appropriately by mouth, short-term. It can cause some side effects such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gout, allergies, worsening of asthma, and low blood pressure.
When applied to the skin: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when applied to the skin or used in a toothpaste, short-term.
When inhaled: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when inhaled, short-term.
When given as a shot: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when given as a shot, short-term. It can cause some side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and blood abnormalities. 

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately for a short-time during pregnancy. Not enough is known about using L-arginine long-term in pregnancy or during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: L-arginine is POSSIBLY SAFE in children when taken by mouth in appropriate doses, when used in a toothpaste, when given as an injection (by IV), or when inhaled. However, L-arginine is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when given as an injection (by IV) in high doses. Doses that are too high can cause serious side effects, including death, in children.
Allergies or asthma: L-arginine can cause an allergic response or make swelling in the airways worse. If you are prone to allergies or asthma and decide to take L-arginine, use it with caution.
Cirrhosis: L-arginine should be used with caution in people with cirrhosis.
Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency: People with this inherited condition are unable to convert arginine and other similar chemicals into creatine. To prevent complications associated with this condition, these people should not take arginine. 
Herpes: There is a concern that L-arginine might make herpes worse. There is some evidence that L-arginine is needed for the herpes virus to multiply.
Low blood pressure: L-arginine might lower blood pressure. This could be a problem if you already have low blood pressure.
Recent heart attack: There is a concern that L-arginine might increase the risk of death after a heart attack, especially in older people. If you have had a heart attack recently, don't take L-arginine.
Kidney disease: L-arginine has caused high potassium levels when used by people with kidney disease.  In some cases, this has resulted in a potentially life-threatening irregular heartbeat.
Surgery: L-arginine might affect blood pressure. There is a concern that it might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking L-arginine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

55,L-Tryptophan,"L-Triptofano, L-Trypt, L-2-amino-3-(indole-3-yl) propionic acid, L-Tryptophane, Tryptophan.","
L-tryptophan is an amino acid. Amino acids are protein building blocks. L-tryptophan is called an ""essential"" amino acid because the body can't make it. It must be acquired from food.

People use L-tryptophan for some mental health disorders, to help quit smoking, for athletic performance, and for emotional symptoms in people with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also concern that using L-tryptophan might cause a condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS).","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for L-TRYPTOPHAN are as follows:Possibly effective for...Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Taking 6 grams of L-tryptophan per day seems to decrease mood swings, tension, and irritability in women with PMDD.
To help people quit smoking. Taking L-tryptophan seems to help people quit smoking when used with conventional treatment.Possibly ineffective for...
Teeth grinding (bruxism). Taking L-tryptophan by mouth doesn't help treat teeth grinding.
Facial pain. Taking L-tryptophan by mouth doesn't help reduce facial pain.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Improving athletic ability. Some research shows that taking L-tryptophan for 3 days before exercising can improve power during exercise. This improvement in power helps increase the distance an athlete can go in the same amount of time. But other early research shows that taking L-tryptophan during exercise doesn't improve endurance during a cycling exercise. Reasons for the conflicting results are not clear. It is possible that L-tryptophan improves some measures of athletic ability but not others. On the other hand, L-tryptophan might need to be taken for a few days before exercise in order to see any benefit.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is some evidence that L-tryptophan levels are lower in children with ADHD. But taking L-tryptophan supplements does not appear to improve ADHD symptoms.
Problems with mental function in the elderly. Taking a mixture of L-tryptophan and other ingredients can slightly improve mental function in older people. But the improvement is very small, so it might not be meaningful. Also, it's not known if any potential benefit is due to L-tryptophan or another ingredient.
Depression. Early research suggests that L-tryptophan might improve the effectiveness of common medications for depression.
Healing ulcers caused by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H pylori). Research shows that taking L-tryptophan in combination with the ulcer medication omeprazole improves ulcer healing rates compared to taking omeprazole alone.
Treating sleep disorders. Taking L-tryptophan might decrease the amount of time it takes to fall asleep and improve mood in healthy people with sleep problems. Taking L-tryptophan might also improve sleep in people with sleep problems related to withdrawal of illegal drugs.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Early research suggests L-tryptophan might be helpful in SAD.
Treating sleep apnea. There is some evidence that taking L-tryptophan might decrease episodes in some people who periodically stop breathing during sleep (sleep apnea).
Anxiety.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate L-tryptophan for these uses.","L-tryptophan is naturally found in animal and plant proteins. L-tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid because our bodies can't make it. It is important for the development and functioning of many organs in the body. After absorbing L-tryptophan from food, our bodies convert it to 5-HTP (5-hyrdoxytryptophan), and then to serotonin, melatonin, and vitamin B6 (nicotinamide). Serotonin is a hormone that transmits signals between nerve cells. It also causes blood vessels to narrow. Changes in the level of serotonin in the brain can alter mood. Melatonin is important for sleep and vitamin B6 is essential for energy metabolism. ","L-tryptophan is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth as a medicine. It has been linked to over 1500 reports of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) and 37 deaths. EMS is a neurological condition with symptoms that include fatigue; intense muscle pain; nerve pain; skin changes; baldness; rash; and pain and swelling affecting the joints, connective tissue, lungs, heart, and liver. Symptoms tend to improve over time, but some people may still experience symptoms up to 2 years after they develop EMS. Some people report that their symptoms have never gone away completely.

In 1990, L-tryptophan was recalled from the market due to these safety concerns. After the limitation of L-tryptophan products, the number of EMS cases dropped sharply. The exact cause of EMS in patients taking L-tryptophan is unknown, but some evidence suggests it may be due to contaminated L-tryptophan products. About 95% of all EMS cases were traced to L-tryptophan produced by a single manufacturer in Japan. Currently, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, L-tryptophan is available and marketed as a dietary supplement.

L-tryptophan can cause some side effects such as heartburn, stomach pain, belching and gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. It can also cause headache, lightheadedness, drowsiness, dry mouth, visual blurring, muscle weakness, and sexual problems.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: L-tryptophan is LIKELY UNSAFE in pregnancy because it may harm the unborn child. Not enough is known about the safety of L-tryptophan during breast-feeding. Avoid using L-tryptophan during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
A white blood cell disorder called eosinophilia: L-tryptophan might make this condition worse. L-tryptophan has been associated with the development of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS).
Liver or kidney disease: L-tryptophan might make these conditions worse since it has been associated with the development of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS).",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/326.html,"Cynober L, Bier DM, Kadowaki M, Morris SM Jr, Elango R, Smriga M.

Lutein is a type of vitamin called a carotenoid. It is related to beta-carotene and vitamin A. Foods rich in lutein include egg yolks, broccoli, spinach, kale, corn, orange pepper, kiwi fruit, grapes, orange juice, zucchini, and squash. Lutein is absorbed best when it is taken with a high-fat meal.

Many people think of lutein as ""the eye vitamin."" It is commonly taken by mouth to prevent eye diseases such as an eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD), and cataracts. There is no good scientific evidence to support the use of lutein for other conditions. 

Many multivitamins contain lutein. They usually provide a relatively small amount, such as 0.25 mg per tablet.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for LUTEIN are as follows:Likely effective for...Lutein deficiency. Taking lutein by mouth prevents lutein deficiency.Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing AMD. But people who already eat high amounts of lutein might not benefit from increasing their intake even more. Taking lutein supplements for up to 36 months can improve some symptoms of AMD. Greater improvement in symptoms might be seen when lutein is taken for at least 1 year at doses above 10 mg, and when it is combined with other carotenoid vitamins. Lutein does not seem to keep AMD from becoming worse over time.
Cataracts. Eating higher amounts of lutein is linked with a lower risk of developing cataracts. Taking supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin reduces the risk of developing cataracts that require surgical removal in people who eat low amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin as part of their diet. Also, taking lutein supplements seems to improve vision in older people who already have cataracts and do not already consume a lot of lutein and zeaxanthin.
Cancer that starts in white blood cells (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet or take lutein supplements might have a lower chance of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Possibly ineffective for...
A lung disease that affects newborns (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). Research shows that giving preterm infants lutein and zeaxanthin by mouth doesn't reduce the chance of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
Heart disease. Some population evidence suggests that people who eat higher amounts of lutein or take lutein supplements have a lower risk of heart-related adverse events like a heart attack or stroke. However, high-quality research shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg by mouth daily doesn't prevent death due to heart disease, stroke, heart attack, or chest pain in older people. 
Fractures. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of fractures.
Stomach cancer. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of developing stomach cancer. 
A serious intestinal disease in premature infants (necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC). Research shows that giving preterm infants lutein and zeaxanthin by mouth doesn't prevent necrotizing enterocolitis.
Pancreatic cancer. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
An inherited eye condition that causes poor night vision and loss of side vision (retinitis pigmentosa). Taking lutein by mouth doesn't improve vision or other symptoms in people with retinitis pigmentosa.
An eye disorder in premature infants that can lead to blindness (retinopathy of prematurity). Research shows that giving preterm infants lutein and zeaxanthin by mouth doesn't prevent retinopathy of prematurity.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Lou Gehrig's Disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS). Early research suggests that people who eat more lutein as part of their diet have a lower risk of developing ALS compared to people who eat lower amounts of lutein.
Breast cancer. Research suggests that higher levels of lutein in the blood are linked with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer.
Cancer of the cervix. Early research suggests that lower intake of lutein as part of the diet is not linked with an increased risk of developing cancer of the cervix.
An inherited condition that causes vision loss (choroideremia). Early research suggests that taking 20 mg of lutein daily for 6 months doesn't improve vision in people with choroideremia.
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. Some research shows that taking that taking lutein plus zeaxanthin doesn't improve speaking or memory in older people. However, other early research shows that taking lutein with or without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can improve speaking and memory in older women.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. There are conflicting results about whether diets containing higher amounts of lutein can reduce the risk of colon or rectal cancer.
Diabetes. Some research suggests that low blood levels of lutein or other carotenoids are linked with blood sugar problems. In theory, taking lutein might reduce the risk of developing diabetes. However, other research suggests that increasing lutein intake in the diet doesn't reduce the risk of developing diabetes.
Vision problems in people with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Early research shows that taking lutein doesn't improve vision in people with diabetes and an eye condition called diabetic retinopathy.
Cancer of the esophagus. Early research suggests that high amounts of lutein in the diet are linked with a decreased risk of developing cancer of the esophagus.
Lung cancer. Some early evidence suggests that low blood levels of lutein are linked with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. However, other research shows that taking lutein doesn't affect the risk of developing or dying from lung cancer.
Parkinson disease. Early research suggests that high amounts of lutein in the diet are not linked with a decreased risk of developing Parkinson disease.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Some research suggests that high blood levels of lutein are linked with a lower risk of developing high blood pressure during pregnancy. It is not clear if taking lutein supplements lowers the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy.
Prostate cancer. Early research shows that low blood levels of lutein are not linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer.
Infection of the airways. Early research shows that high blood levels of lutein are not linked with a decreased risk of infection of the airways.
Eye strain (asthenopia).
Muscle soreness caused by exercise.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of lutein for these uses.
","Lutein is one of two major carotenoids found as a color pigment in the human eye (macula and retina). It is thought to function as a light filter, protecting the eye tissues from sunlight damage.","When taken by mouth: Lutein is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth. Consuming 6.9-20 mg of lutein daily as part of the diet or as a supplement appears to be safe. 


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:  Lutein is LIKELY SAFE when used in the amounts found in food.
Children:  Lutein is LIKELY SAFE when used appropriately. A specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing lutein 0.14 mg daily has been safely used in infants for 36 weeks.
Cystic fibrosis: People with cystic fibrosis might not absorb some carotenoids from food very well, and often have low blood levels of lutein. How much the body absorbs from lutein supplementation might also be decreased in people with cystic fibrosis.
Skin cancer: There is some concern that higher blood levels of lutein are linked to slightly increased risk of skin cancer in people at high risk who also have a history of skin cancer.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/754.html,"Zhou Y, Wang T, Meng Q, Zhai S.

Lycopene is a naturally occurring chemical that gives fruits and vegetables a red color. It is one of a number of pigments called carotenoids. Lycopene is found in tomatoes, watermelons, red oranges, pink grapefruits, apricots, rosehips, and guavas. In North America, 85% of dietary lycopene comes from tomato products such as ketchup, tomato juice, sauce, or paste. A serving of fresh tomatoes contains between 4 mg and 10 mg of lycopene, while one cup (240 mL) of tomato juice provides about 20 mg. Processing raw tomatoes using heat (in the making of tomato juice, tomato paste or ketchup, for example) actually changes the lycopene in the raw product into a form that is easier for the body to use. The lycopene in supplements is about as easy for the body to use as lycopene found in food.

People are trying lycopene for lowering blood pressure and high cholesterol, for heart disease and cancer, and many other conditions. However, there is no scientific evidence to support many of these uses.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for LYCOPENE are as follows:Possibly ineffective for...
Bladder cancer. Research suggests that there is no link between lycopene consumption in the diet or lycopene blood levels and the risk for bladder cancer.
Diabetes. Research suggests that increased lycopene consumption in the diet does not decrease the risk of developing diabetes.
Parkinson's disease. Research suggests that increased lycopene consumption in the diet does not decrease the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Age-related eye disease (age-related macular degeneration, AMD). Research on the effect of lycopene in AMD is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that people with low lycopene levels are almost twice as likely to develop AMD compared to people with high levels. However, other research suggests that there is no link between lycopene levels or lycopene intake and the risk of AMD.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Lycopene is one type of carotenoid. Early research has found that diets rich in carotenoids such as lycopene are linked with a decreased risk of ALS. But diets specifically rich in lycopene alone don't seem to be linked with a decreased risk of ALS.
Asthma. Early research shows that taking a product containing lycopene doesn't prevent asthma flare-ups in people with stable asthma. But it might improve lung function after exercise in people with asthma who tend to have flare-ups after exercise.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). There is some evidence that higher lycopene blood levels are associated with a reduced risk of hardening of the arteries. There is also early evidence that higher lycopene blood levels can reduce the risk of heart disease associated with hardening of the arteries. However, there does not appear to be a link between lycopene levels and stroke risk.
Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Early research shows that taking lycopene can slow the rate of prostate growth and can improve symptoms in people with this condition. However, other research found no link between lycopene intake in the diet and the development of an enlarged prostate.
Breast cancer. Research about how lycopene affects breast cancer risk is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that having higher lycopene blood levels is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. However, other research shows that neither lycopene intake nor lycopene blood levels are linked to breast cancer risk.
Heart disease. Some research shows that women with higher levels of lycopene in their blood have a reduced risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack. But other research shows that diets rich in lycopene are not link with a reduced risk of heart attack or stroke in women or men who are at low risk for heart disease. Research also shows that taking a lycopene supplement does not reduce most risk factors for heart diseases, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. It's not known if taking a lycopene supplement reduces the risk of heart disease-related events such as stroke or heart attack.
Cataracts. One study suggests that higher lycopene blood levels are associated with a lower risk of developing cataracts. However, other studies have found no link between lycopene intake or lycopene blood levels and the risk of developing cataracts.
Cervical cancer. Research about how lycopene affects the risk of cervical cancer is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that higher lycopene blood levels or higher lycopene intake in the diet is linked to a lower risk of cervical cancer. Other studies have not found this link.
Colon and rectal cancer. Some research has found that diets rich in lycopene are linked with a decreased risk of colon and rectal cancer. But other research has found no link between lycopene intake in the diet and the risk of colon and rectal cancer.
Cancer affecting the tube connecting the throat and stomach (esophageal cancer). Early research has found that diets rich in lycopene are linked with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer.
Muscle damage caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking a combination of lycopene and other ingredients can reduce the muscle damage that occurs with a 2-hour long-distance run.
Brain tumor (glioma). Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth for 3 months does not improve the response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in people with brain tumors.
Ulcers caused by H. pylori infection. Early research shows that taking lycopene along with antibiotics does not help treat H. pylori infection compared to taking antibiotics alone.
Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Women with higher levels of lycopene in their blood seem to recover from cancer-associated HPV infection faster than women with lower lycopene blood levels.
High cholesterol. Early research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals, India) by mouth daily for 6 months lowers total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol. However, other evidence suggests that lycopene does not affect cholesterol levels in healthy adults or in those with heart disease.
High blood pressure. Early research shows that taking lycopene daily for 8 weeks seems to lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, taking this same product did not lower blood pressure in people with pre-hypertension.
Lung cancer. Research about how lycopene affects the risk of lung cancer is inconsistent. Some research shows that lower lycopene intake in the diet is linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. However, other research suggests that there is no link between lycopene consumption in the diet or lycopene blood levels and lung cancer risk.
Male fertility problems. Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth daily for 3 months improves sperm quality in some men with fertility problems due to unknown causes.
Menopausal symptoms. Early research shows that taking a specific product containing lycopene, calcium, vitamin D3, astaxanthin, and citrus bioflavonoids daily for 8 weeks reduces menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, joint pain, anxiety, and depression.
White pre-cancerous patches in the mouth (oral leukoplakia). Early research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement by mouth twice daily improves white pre-cancerous patches in the mouth.
A mouth condition called oral submucous fibrosis. Some people with this condition can't open their mouth as wide as normal. Taking lycopene for 2-3 months might help these people open their mouth by a small amount more.
Ovarian cancer. There is inconsistent evidence about the effect of lycopene on ovarian cancer risk. Some research shows that a diet rich in carotenoids, including lycopene, seems to help prevent ovarian cancer in young (premenopausal) women. However, other research shows that the risk of developing ovarian cancer is not linked to lycopene blood levels or lycopene intake from the diet.
Pancreatic cancer. Some early research shows that a diet high in lycopene, primarily from tomatoes, seems to lower the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
Gum disease. Research about the effects of lycopene on gingivitis is inconsistent. Some research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement by mouth for 2 weeks or receiving a single shot of lycopene gel into the gums reduces gum disease. But other research shows that taking a product containing lycopene and other vitamins and minerals does not reduce gum disease.
Polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Early research shows that a combination product containing lycopene and other ingredients can reduce skin reactions to light in people with PMLE.
High blood pressure during pregnancy. Research on the effect of lycopene for preventing high blood pressure during pregnancy is unclear. Some research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement twice daily starting between weeks 16 and 20 of pregnancy and continuing until delivery lowers blood pressure and reduces associated complications. However, other research suggests that lycopene does not affect blood pressure during pregnancy. 
Prostate cancer. Research on the effects of lycopene for preventing or treating prostate cancer is inconsistent. Some research suggests that increasing lycopene consumption in the diet, or having higher lycopene blood levels, is linked with a lower risk of prostate cancer. However, other research shows no link between lycopene intake or blood levels and prostate cancer risk. In addition, early research in men with precancerous changes in their prostate shows that taking lycopene supplements might delay or prevent the progression to prostate cancer. However, in other research, taking lycopene daily for up to one year did not seem to help treat prostate cancer.
Prostate swelling and pelvic pain. Early research shows that taking a specific combination of lycopene, selenium, and saw palmetto by mouth for 8 weeks reduces pain in men with prostate swelling and pelvic pain compared to taking saw palmetto alone.
Kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma). Early research shows no link between lycopene consumption in the diet and the risk of developing kidney cancer
Sunburn. Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth, alone or together with other ingredients, might protect against sunburn
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate lycopene for these uses.","Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that may help protect cells from damage. This is why there is a lot of research interest in lycopene's role, if any, in preventing cancer.","Lycopene is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. Daily supplements containing up to 120 mg of lycopene have been used safely for up to one year.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Lycopene is LIKELY SAFE during pregnancy and breast-feeding when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. However, lycopene is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken as a supplement during pregnancy. In one study, using a specific lycopene supplement (LycoRed, Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals, India) 2 mg daily, starting between weeks 12 and 20 of pregnancy and continuing until delivery, increased the rate of premature births and low-birth-weight babies. But in another study using the same lycopene supplement, these problems weren't seen. Not enough is known about the safety of lycopene supplements during breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, avoid using lycopene in amounts greater than those typically found in foods.
Surgery: Lycopene might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using lycopene supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/554.html,"Nieman DC, Capps CL, Capps CR, Shue ZL, McBride JE.

Maca is a plant that grows in central Peru in the high plateaus of the Andes Mountains. It has been cultivated as a vegetable crop in this area for at least 3000 years. Maca is a relative of the radish and has an odor similar to butterscotch. Its root is used to make medicine.

People take maca by mouth for ""tired blood"" (anemia); chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); and enhancing energy, stamina, athletic performance, and memory. People also take maca by mouth for female hormone imbalance, menstrual problems, symptoms of menopause, improving fertility, and sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants, weak bones (osteoporosis), depression, stomach cancer, leukemia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, erectile dysfunction (ED), to arouse sexual desire, and to boost the immune system.

In foods, maca is eaten baked or roasted, prepared as a soup, and used for making a fermented drink called maca chicha.

In agriculture, it is used to increase fertility in livestock.

Manganese is a mineral that is found in several foods including nuts, legumes, seeds, tea, whole grains, and leafy green vegetables. It is considered an essential nutrient, because the body requires it to function properly. People use manganese as medicine.

Manganese is taken by mouth for manganese deficiency. It is also used for weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis), osteoarthritis, and other conditions. 

Manganese is given intravenously (by IV) for manganese deficiency and as a trace element in a nutrition preparation that is given by IV called total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Manganese is applied to the skin for wound healing.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for MANGANESE are as follows:Effective for...Manganese deficiency. Taking manganese by mouth or giving manganese intravenously (by IV) helps to treat or prevent low manganese levels in the body. Also, taking manganese by mouth along with other vitamins and minerals can promote growth in children who have low levels of manganese in developing countries.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hay fever. Using a salt-water nasal spray with added manganese seems to reduce episodes of acute hay fever, but a plain salt-water spray may work just as well.
A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). Early research shows that giving manganese, selenium, and zinc intravenously (by IV) may help people with worsened COPD to breathe on their own without help from a machine sooner.
Obesity. Early research shows that taking a specific product containing manganese, 7-oxo-DHEA, L-tyrosine, asparagus root extract, choline bitartrate, inositol, copper gluconate, and potassium iodide by mouth for 8 weeks can slightly reduce weight in overweight people. It is unclear if taking manganese alone has an effect on weight.
Osteoarthritis. Taking a specific product containing manganese, glucosamine hydrochloride, and chondroitin sulfate by mouth for 4 months improves pain and the ability to do normal activities in people with osteoarthritis of the knee and the lower back. However, many studies show that taking glucosamine plus chondroitin without manganese might help treat osteoarthritis. Therefore, the effects of manganese are unclear.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking manganese by mouth in combination with calcium, zinc, and copper reduces spinal bone loss in older women. Also, taking a specific product containing manganese, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, zinc, copper, and boron for one year seems to improve bone mass in women with weak bones. However, many studies show that taking calcium plus vitamin D without manganese can help treat osteoporosis. Therefore, the effects of manganese are unclear.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Early research shows that taking manganese along with calcium helps improve symptoms of PMS, including pain, crying, loneliness, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, mood swings, depression, and tension. Researchers aren't sure whether the improvement is due to the calcium, manganese, or the combination.
Wound healing. Early research shows that applying a dressing containing manganese, calcium, and zinc to chronic skin wounds for 12 weeks may improve wound healing.
Anemia.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of manganese for these uses.","Manganese is an essential nutrient involved in many chemical processes in the body, including processing of cholesterol, carbohydrates, and protein. It might also be involved in bone formation.","When taken by mouth: Manganese is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth in amounts up to 11 mg per day. However, people who have trouble getting rid of manganese from the body, such as people with liver disease, may experience side effects when taking less than 11 mg per day.
Taking more than 11 mg per day by mouth is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for most adults.

When given by IV: Manganese is LIKELY SAFE when given by IV as part of parenteral nutrition under the supervision of a health care provider. It's generally recommended that parenteral nutrition provides no more than 55 mcg of manganese per day, especially when used long-term. Receiving more than 55 mcg of manganese per day by IV as part of parenteral nutrition is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for most adults. 
When inhaled: Manganese is LIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled by adults for long periods of time. Excess manganese in the body can cause serious side effects, including symptoms resembling Parkinson disease, such as shaking (tremors).

Special precautions & warnings:
Children: Taking manganese by mouth is LIKELY SAFE for children 1 to 3 years in amounts less than 2 mg per day; for children 4 to 8 years in amounts less than 3 mg per day; for children 9 to 13 years in amounts less than 6 mg per day; and for children 14 to 18 years in amounts less than 9 mg per day. Manganese in higher doses than described is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Talk with your health care provider before giving manganese to children. High doses of manganese might cause serious side effects. Manganese is LIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled by children.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Manganese is LIKELY SAFE in pregnant or breast-feeding adult women aged 19 or older when taken by mouth in doses of less than 11 mg per day. However, pregnant and lactating women under age 19 should limit doses to less than 9 mg per day. Manganese is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in higher doses. Doses over 11 mg per day are more likely to cause serious side effects. Manganese is LIKELY UNSAFE when inhaled by women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
Long-term liver disease: People with long-term liver disease have trouble getting rid of manganese. Manganese can build up in these people and cause shaking, mental problems such as psychosis, and other side effects. If you have liver disease, be careful not to get too much manganese.
Iron-deficiency anemia: People with iron-deficiency anemia seem to absorb more manganese than other people. If you have this condition, be careful not to get too much manganese.
Nutrition that is given intravenously (by IV). People who receive nutrition intravenously (by IV) are at an increased risk of side effects due to manganese.

Maritime pine trees grow in countries on the Mediterranean Sea. The bark is used to make medicine. Maritime pine trees that grown in an area in southwest France are used to make Pycnogenol, the US registered trademark name for a commercially available maritime pine bark extract. The active ingredients in maritime pine can also be extracted from other sources, including peanut skin, grape seed, and witch hazel bark.

Maritime pine bark extract is commonly used orally to treat and prevent diabetes, diabetes-related health issues, and problems of the heart and blood vessels among many other uses.

Some people use skin creams that contain maritime pine bark extract as ""anti-aging"" products. It is also applied to the skin to treat foot ulcers in people with diabetes, hemorrhoids, and mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy.

There is limited scientific research to support most of these uses.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for MARITIME PINE are as follows:Possibly effective for...Allergies. Some research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark before the start of allergy season reduces allergy symptoms in people with birch allergies.
Asthma. Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark daily, along with asthma medications, seems to decrease asthma symptoms and the need for rescue inhalers in children and adults with asthma. 
Athletic performance. Young people (age 20-35 years) seem to be able to exercise on a treadmill for a longer time after taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark daily for about a month. Also, athletes training for a physical fitness test or a triathalon seem to perform better in the tests and competitions when they take this extract daily for 8 weeks while training compared to only training.
Circulation problems. Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth seems to reduce leg pain and heaviness, as well as fluid retention, in people with circulation problems. Using this extract with compression stockings also appears to be more effective than using compression stockings alone. Some people also use horse chestnut seed extract to treat this condition, but using the maritime pine bark extract appears to be more effective.
Improving mental function. Research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth for 3-12 months improves mental function and memory in adults of all ages.
Disease of the retina in the eye. Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth for 2 months seems to slow or prevent further worsening of retinal disease caused by diabetes, atherosclerosis, or other diseases. It also seems to improve eyesight.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Age-related muscle loss. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth improves muscle function in elderly adults with signs of muscle loss.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth does not seem to help ADHD symptoms in adults. However, taking it by mouth for one month appears to improve symptoms in children.
Mental impairment. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark improves mental function in adults with mild mental impairment.
Common cold. Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth twice daily starting at the beginning of a cold seems to reduce the number of days with a cold and the number of lost working days. It also seems to reduce the amount of over-the-counter cold products needed to manage symptoms.
Clogged arteries (coronary artery disease). There is some evidence that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark three times daily for 4 weeks might help improve some complications associated with clogged arteries.
Blood clots in deep veins (deep vein thrombosis, DVT). There is some evidence that taking a specific combination product containing maritime pine might help to prevent DVT during long-haul plane flights. The product combines a blend of standardized maritime pine bark extract plus nattokinase. Also, taking a standardized maritime pine bark extract alone before a flight, 6 hours after the flight, and the following day might help to prevent blood clots forming in the veins during long flights in people at high risk. In addition, taking the extract for one year seems to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome. This condition can develop in people who already experienced a blood clot.
Dental plaque. Early research suggests that chewing at least 6 pieces of gum with added extract from maritime pine bark for 14 days reduces bleeding and prevents increased plaque.
Diabetes. Early evidence suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark daily for 3-12 weeks slightly decreases blood sugar in people with diabetes.
Foot ulcers due to diabetes. Early research suggests that taking maritime pine bark extract by mouth and applying it to the skin helps heal foot ulcers related to diabetes.
Circulation problems in diabetes. Early research shows that taking standardized maritime pine bark extract three times daily for 4 weeks improves circulation and symptoms in people with diabetes.
Swelling (edema). Early research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark reduces ankle swelling after long plane flights.
Erectile dysfunction (ED). Early research suggests that standardized maritime pine bark extract, used alone or in combination with L-arginine, might improve sexual function in men with ED. It seems to take up to 3 months of treatment for significant improvement.
Heart failure. Early research suggests that taking a specific combination product containing standardized maritime pine bark and coenzyme Q10 for 12 weeks improves some symptoms of heart failure.
Hemorrhoids. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth, alone or in combination with a cream containing this same extract, improves quality of life and symptoms of hemorrhoids. Other research shows that taking this same extract by mouth can improve the symptoms of hemorrhoids in women after giving birth.
High cholesterol. A standardized extract of maritime pine bark seems to lower ""bad cholesterol"" (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol) in people with high cholesterol. However, this extract doesn't seem to improve cholesterol levels in people with other conditions such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and erectile dysfunction. A different standardized extract of maritime pine bark seems to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good cholesterol"") in people with high blood pressure. 
High blood pressure. One standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) seems to lower systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) but does not lower diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number). This extract might also help lower blood pressure in some patients already treated with the blood pressure-lowering drug ramipril. However, this extract does not lower blood pressure in postmenopausal women. Also, other maritime pine bark extracts (Toyo-FVG and Oligopin)) do not appear to lower blood pressure in people with slightly high blood pressure.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark can reduce abdominal pain, cramps, and medication use in people with IBS.
Jet lag. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark, starting 2-3 days before a plane flight, can shorten the time that jet lag symptoms occur and also reduce the symptoms of jet lag.
Leg cramps. There is some evidence that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth daily might decrease leg cramps.
An inner ear disorder (Meniere's disease). Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark can decrease ringing in the ears and overall symptoms in adults with Meniere's disease.
Menopausal symptoms. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth decreases menopausal symptoms, including tiredness, headache, depression and anxiety, and hot flashes.
Metabolic syndrome. Early research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth three times daily for 6 months lowers triglycerides, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure, and increases high-density lipoprotein (""good"" or HDL) cholesterol in people with metabolic syndrome.
Oral mucositis. Applying a solution containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark inside the mouth for one week seems to help heal mouth ulcers in children and adolescents undergoing chemotherapy treatment.
Osteoarthritis. There is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of maritime pine for osteoarthritis. Taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth might reduce overall symptoms, but it does not seem to reduce pain or improve the ability to perform daily tasks.
Pain in late pregnancy. Early research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine by mouth daily during the last 3 months of pregnancy reduces lower back pain, hip joint pain, pelvic pain, and pain due to varicose veins or calf cramps.
Pelvic pain in women. There is early evidence that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth might help reduce pelvic pain in women with endometriosis or severe menstrual cramps.
Psoriasis. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth can reduce the size of skin plaques, improve quality of life, and reduce the use of steroids in people with psoriasis.
Problems with sexual function. Early research suggests that taking a combination product containing a standardized extract of maritime pine bark, L-arginine, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract daily for 8 weeks can help improve sexual function in women.
Improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Early research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark by mouth reduces symptoms of SLE in some patients.
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Early research suggests that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark nymouth reduces ringing in the ears.
Varicose veins. Early research shows that taking a standardized extract of maritime pine bark can reduce leg cramps, leg swelling, and the number of varicose veins and spider veins in women after giving birth.
Muscle soreness.
Stroke prevention.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate maritime pine for these uses.
","Maritime pine contains substances that might improve blood flow. It might also stimulate the immune system, reduce swelling, prevent infections, and have antioxidant effects.","A standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in doses of 50 mg to 450 mg daily for up to one year, and when applied to the skin as a cream for up to 7 days or as a powder for up to 6 weeks. It may can cause dizziness, stomach problems, headache, mouth sores, and bad breath.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Early research suggests that a standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is POSSIBLY SAFE when used in late pregnancy. However, until more is known, it should be used cautiously or avoided by women who are pregnant.

There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking maritime pine products if you are breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: A standardized extract of maritime pine bark (Pycnogenol, Horphag Research) is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth, short-term.
""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Maritime pine might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using maritime pine..
Bleeding conditions: In theory, high doses of maritime pine might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding conditions.
Diabetes: In theory, high doses of maritime pine might decrease blood sugar too much in people with diabetes.
Hepatitis: In theory, taking maritime pine might worsen liver function in people with hepatitis. 
Surgery: Maritime pine might slow blood clotting and reduce blood sugar. There is some concern that it might cause blood sugar to go too low and increase the chance of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using maritime pine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a chemical found in green plants, animals, and humans. It can also be made in a laboratory. MSM has become popular because of the book The Miracle of MSM: The Natural Solution for Pain. But there is little published scientific research to support its use. Contrary to some literature that promotes MSM, there is no Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for MSM or sulfur, which is in MSM. Sulfur deficiency has not been described in the medical literature.

People take MSM by mouth and apply it to the skin for chronic pain, osteoarthritis, joint inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation around the joints (bursitis), tendinitis, swelling around the tendons (tenosynovitis), nerve pain (neuropathy) caused by cancer drugs, musculoskeletal pain, muscle cramps, hardened skin condition called scleroderma, scar tissue, stretch marks, hair loss, wrinkles, protection against sun/wind burn, eye inflammation, oral hygiene, gum disease, wounds, cuts, and abrasions/accelerated wound healing.

People also take MSM by mouth for relief of allergies, chronic constipation, ""sour stomach"", ulcers, a bowel disease called diverticulosis, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), mood elevation, obesity, poor circulation, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. It is also taken by mouth for type 2 diabetes, liver problems, Alzheimer's disease, to control snoring, lung disorders including emphysema and pneumonia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematous), HIV infection and AIDS, and cancer (breast cancer and colon cancer).

MSM is also taken by mouth for eye inflammation, mucous membrane inflammation, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, leg cramps, migraine, headaches, hangover, parasitic infections of the intestinal and urogenital tracts including Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia, yeast infection, insect bites, radiation poisoning, and to boost the immune system.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for METHYLSULFONYLMETHANE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Hemorrhoids. Research shows that applying a specific gel containing MSM together with hyaluronic acid and tea tree oil (Proctoial, BSD Pharma) for 14 days can reduce pain, bleeding, and irritation in people with hemorrhoids.
Osteoarthritis. Research shows that taking MSM by mouth in two to three divided doses daily, either alone or together with glucosamine, can slightly reduce pain and swelling and improve function in people with osteoarthritis. But the improvements might not be clinically significant. Also, MSM might not improve stiffness or overall symptoms. Some research has looked at taking MSM with other ingredients. Taking an MSM product (Lignisul, Laborest Italia S.p.A.) together with boswellic acid (Triterpenol, Laborest Italia S.p.A.) daily for 60 days might reduce the need for anti-inflammatory drugs but does not reduce pain. Taking MSM, boswellic acid, and vitamin C (Artrosulfur C, Laborest Italia S.p.A.) for 6 months might reduce pain and improve walking distance. Taking MSM, glucosamine, and chondroitin for 12 weeks may also reduce pain in people with osteoarthritis. Also, early research suggests that taking a combination product containing MSM (AR7 Joint Complex, Robinson Pharma) by mouth for 12 weeks improves rating scores for joint pain and tenderness in people with osteoarthritis, but does not improve the appearance of joints.
Possibly ineffective for...Varicose veins and other circulatory problems (chronic venous insufficiency). Research shows that applying MSM and EDTA to the skin can reduce swelling in the calf, ankle, and foot in people with chronic venous insufficiency. But applying MSM alone seems to actually increase swelling.
Exercise performance. Research shows that taking MSM daily for 28 days does not improve exercise performance. Also, applying a specific cream containing MSM (MagPro, Custom Prescription Shoppe) before stretching does not seem to improve flexibility of endurance.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hay fever. Early research suggests that taking MSM (OptiMSM 650 mg) by mouth for 30 days can relieve some symptoms of hay fever.
Shoulder surgery. Early research suggest that taking a specific combination product containing MSM (Tenosan, Agave s.r.l.) for 3 months can reduce pain after surgery and slightly improve healing. But it does not seem to help the overall function of the shoulder after surgery.
Reducing nerve pain (neuropathy) caused by cancer drugs. Early research shows that taking a specific combination product (OPERA, GAMFARMA s.r.l) containing MSM and other ingredients for 12 weeks reduces nerve pain caused by cancer drugs compared to baseline.  It's unclear if this change is due to a placebo effect.
Muscle damage caused by exercise. Evidence for using MSM to reduce muscle damage caused by exercise is unclear. Some research shows that taking MSM daily beginning 10 days before a 14-km running exercise can help reduce muscle damage. But other research shows that taking MSM daily beginning 21 days before a 13.1-mile running exercise does not help to reduce muscle damage.
Joint pain. Research shows that taking a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing MSM daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain. But this product does not seem to improve stiffness or function.
Rosacea. Research shows that applying an MSM cream to the skin twice daily for one month can improve redness and other symptoms of rosacea.
Tendon pain due to overuse. Early research suggests that taking a specific combination product containing MSM (Tenosan, Agave s.r.l.) might improve the outcomes of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in people with tendon pain. But it is not clear if the benefits are from MSM or other ingredients in this product.

More evidence is needed to rate MSM for these uses.",MSM might supply sulfur to make other chemicals in the body.,"MSM is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 3 months or when applied to the skin in combination with other ingredients, such as silymarin or hyaluronic acid and tea tree oil, for up to 20 days. In some people, MSM might cause nausea, diarrhea, bloating, fatigue, headache, insomnia, itching, or worsening of allergy symptoms.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking MSM if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.

Niacin is a form of vitamin B3. It is found in foods such as yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Niacin is also produced in the body from tryptophan, which is found in protein-containing food. When taken as a supplement, niacin is often found in combination with other B vitamins. 

Do not confuse niacin with niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, IP-6, or tryptophan. See the separate listings for these topics. 

Niacin is commonly taken by mouth for high cholesterol and to increase levels of a specific type of good cholesterol, known as HDL. Niacin is also taken by mouth for preventing vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. It is also taken by mouth for metabolic syndrome and diarrhea caused by cholera infection. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for NIACIN are as follows:Likely effective for...
Abnormal levels of blood fats. Some niacin products are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as prescription products for treating abnormal levels of blood fats. These prescription niacin products typically come in high strengths of 500 mg or higher. Dietary supplement forms of niacin usually come in strengths of 250 mg or less. Since very high doses of niacin are required for improving cholesterol levels, dietary supplement niacin usually isn't appropriate. For people who need to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, the prescription drug class called ""statins"" is used. Niacin might be used in people with high levels of both cholesterol AND blood fats called triglycerides. Niacin may be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs when diet and single-drug therapy is not enough. Niacin improves cholesterol levels, but does not improve cardiovascular outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes. 
Treatment and prevention of niacin deficiency, and certain conditions related to niacin deficiency such as pellagra. Niacin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these uses. However, using niacinamide instead of niacin is sometimes preferred because niacinamide doesn't cause ""flushing,"" (redness, itching and tingling), a side effect of niacin treatment.

Possibly effective for...
Diarrhea from an infection called cholera. Taking niacin by mouth seems to control the loss of fluid due to cholera.
Abnormal levels of blood fats in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking niacin seems to improve levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides in HIV/AIDS patients with abnormal blood fat levels due to antiretroviral treatment.
Metabolic syndrome. Taking niacin seems to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol and reduce levels of blood fats called triglycerides in people with metabolic syndrome. Taking the niacin along with a prescription omega-3 fatty acid seems to work even better.
Ineffective for...
Cardiovascular disease. High quality research shows that niacin does not prevent cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke or death related to cardiovascular disease in people who take niacin to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. Niacin has not been shown to reduce the risk of death. Niacin improves cholesterol levels, but it does not improve outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. Niacin should not be taken to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Taking niacin by mouth along with medicines called bile acid sequestrants might reduce hardening of the arteries in men with this condition. It seems to work best in men with high levels of blood fats called triglycerides. But taking niacin does not seem to reduce hardening of the arteries in patients with a condition called peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Also, niacin does not prevent cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke.
Alzheimer's disease. People who consume higher amounts of niacin from food and multivitamins seem to have a lower risk of getting Alzheimer's disease than people who consume less niacin. But there is no evidence that taking a stand-alone niacin supplement helps to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
Cataracts. People who eat a diet high in niacin might have a reduced chance of developing nuclear cataracts. Nuclear cataract is the most common type of cataract. The effect of taking niacin supplementation is unknown.
Erectile dysfunction. Taking extended-release niacin 1.5 grams at bedtime for 12 weeks seems to help men with erectile dysfunction and high lipid levels maintain an erection during sexual intercourse.
Exercise performance. Research shows that taking a supplement containing niacin and other ingredients before exercise does not improve performance during exercise in men.
High levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). High blood levels of phosphate can result from kidney dysfunction. Some early research shows that taking niacin by mouth can reduce blood levels of phosphate in people with end-stage kidney disease and high levels of blood phosphate. But other research shows that taking niacin by mouth at a higher dose does not lower blood phosphate levels when taken along with medication used to lower blood phosphate levels.
Blockage of the vein in the eye (retinal vein occlusion): Early research shows that taking niacin might improve eyesight in people with a blockage in the retinal vein.
Sickle cell disease: Early research shows that taking niacin does not improve the levels of blood fats in people with sickle cell disease.
Acne.
Alcohol dependence.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Depression.
Dizziness.
Drug-induced hallucinations.
Migraine or premenstrual headache.
Motion sickness.
Schizophrenia.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate niacin for these uses.","Niacin is absorbed by the body when dissolved in water and taken by mouth. It is converted to niacinamide if taken in amounts greater than what is needed by the body.
 

Niacin is required for the proper function of fats and sugars in the body and to maintain healthy cells. At high doses, niacin might help people with heart disease because of its beneficial effects on clotting. It may also improve levels of a certain type of fat called triglycerides in the blood.
 

Niacin deficiency can cause a condition called pellagra, which causes skin irritation, diarrhea, and dementia. Pellagra was common in the early twentieth century, but is less common now, since some foods containing flour are now fortified with niacin. Pellagra has been virtually eliminated in western culture.


People with poor diet, alcoholism, and some types of slow-growing tumors called carcinoid tumors might be at risk for niacin deficiency.
","Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth. A common minor side effect of niacin is a flushing reaction. This might cause burning, tingling, itching, and redness of the face, arms, and chest, as well as headaches. Starting with small doses of niacin and taking 325 mg of aspirin before each dose of niacin will help reduce the flushing reaction. Usually, this reaction goes away as the body gets used to the medication. Alcohol can make the flushing reaction worse. Avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin.

Other minor side effects of niacin are stomach upset, intestinal gas, dizziness, pain in the mouth, and other problems.

When doses of over 3 grams per day of niacin are taken, more serious side effects can happen. These include liver problems, gout, ulcers of the digestive tract, loss of vision, high blood sugar, irregular heartbeat, and other serious problems.

When used daily for multiple years, niacin might increase the risk of developing diabetes.

Some concern has been raised about stroke risk in people taking niacin. In one large study, people who took high doses of niacin had a two-fold greater risk of stroke compared to those not taking niacin. However, it is unlikely that this outcome was due to niacin. Other research has shown that niacin has no effect on the risk of stroke. 
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amounts. The recommended amount of niacin for pregnant or breast-feeding women is 30 mg per day for women under 18 years of age, and 35 mg for women over 18.
Allergies: Niacin might worsen allergies by causing histamine, the chemical responsible for allergic symptoms, to be released.
Heart disease/unstable angina: Large amounts of niacin can increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Use with caution.
Crohn's disease: People with Crohn's disease might have low niacin levels and require supplementation during flare-ups.
Diabetes: Niacin might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacin should check their blood sugar carefully.
Gallbladder disease: Niacin might make gallbladder disease worse.
Gout: Large amounts of niacin might bring on gout.
Kidney disease: Niacin might accumulate in people with kidney disease. This might cause harm.
Liver disease: Niacin might increase liver damage. Don't use large amounts if you have liver disease.
Stomach or intestinal ulcers: Niacin might make ulcers worse. Don't use large amounts if you have ulcers.
Very low blood pressure: Niacin might lower blood pressure and worsen this condition.
Surgery: Niacin might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking niacin at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.
Fatty deposits around tendons (tendon xanthomas): Niacin might increase the risk of infections in xanthomas.
Thyroid disorders: Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Niacin might lower blood levels of thyroxine. This might worsen symptoms of certain thyroid disorders.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/924.html,"Anderson TJ, Grégoire J, Pearson GJ, et al. 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in the Adult.

","
There are two forms of vitamin B3. One form is niacin, the other is niacinamide. Niacinamide is found in many foods including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, beans, and cereal grains. Niacinamide is also found in many vitamin B complex supplements with other B vitamins. Niacinamide can also be formed in the body from dietary niacin.

Do not confuse niacinamide with niacin, NADH, nicotinamide riboside, inositol nicotinate, or tryptophan. See the separate listings for these topics.

Niacinamide is taken by mouth for preventing vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. It is also taken by mouth for acne, diabetes, oral cancer, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions. However, there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. 

Niacinamide is also applied to the skin for acne, eczema, and other skin conditions. There is also no good evidence to support these uses. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for NIACINAMIDE are as follows:Likely effective for...
A disease cause by niacin deficiency (pellagra). Niacinamide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these uses. Niacinamide is sometimes preferred over niacin because it does not cause ""flushing,"" (redness, itching and tingling), a side effect of niacin treatment.

Possibly effective for...
Acne. Early research shows that taking tablets containing niacinamide and other ingredients for 8 weeks improves skin appearance in people with acne. Other research shows that applying a cream containing niacinamide improves the appearance of skin in people with acne. 
Diabetes. Some research shows that taking niacinamide might help prevent the loss of insulin production in children and adults at risk for type 1 diabetes. It might also prevent the loss of insulin production and reduce the dose of insulin needed by children recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. However, niacinamide does not seem to prevent the development of type 1 diabetes in at-risk children. In people with type 2 diabetes, niacinamide seems to help protect insulin production and improve blood sugar control.
High levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). High blood levels of phosphate can be caused by reduced kidney function. In people with kidney failure who are on hemodialysis and have high levels of blood phosphate, taking niacinamide seems to help decrease phosphate levels when taken with or without phosphate binders.
Head and neck cancer. Research shows that taking niacinamide while receiving radiotherapy and a type of treatment called carbogen might help control tumor growth and increase survival in some people with cancer of the larynx. Taking niacinamide while receiving radiotherapy and carbogen seems to benefit people with cancer of the larynx who are also anemic. It also seems to help people who have tumors that are deprived of oxygen.
Skin cancer. Taking niacinamide seems to help prevent new skin cancer or precancerous spots (actinic keratosis) from forming in people with a history of skin cancer or actinic keratosis.
Osteoarthritis. Taking niacinamide seems to improve joint flexibility and reduce pain and swelling in people with osteoarthritis. Also, some people with osteoarthritis who take niacinamide might need to take fewer pain medications.

Possibly ineffective for...
Brain tumor. Early research shows that treating people with surgically removed brain tumors with niacinamide, radiotherapy, and carbogen does not improve survival compared to radiotherapy or radiotherapy and carbogen.
Bladder cancer. Treating people with bladder cancer with niacinamide, radiotherapy, and carbogen does not appear to decrease tumor growth or improve survival compared to radiotherapy or radiotherapy and carbogen. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). Early research suggests that taking niacinamide, vitamin E, and lutein for a year improves how well the retina works in people with age-related vision loss due to retina damage.
Aging skin. Early research shows that taking niacinamide, vitamin E, and lutein for almost a year improves how well the retina works in people with age-related vision loss due to retina damage.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that applying cream containing 2% niacinamide decreases water loss and improves hydration, and reduces redness and scaling, in people with eczema.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is conflicting evidence regarding the usefulness of niacinamide in combination with other vitamins for the treatment of ADHD.
Skin redness caused by injury or irritation (erythema). Early research shows that applying a cream containing niacinamide reduces skin redness, dryness, and itching caused by the acne medication isotretinoin. 
Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Early research shows that taking niacinamide does not help reduce itchiness in people with kidney disease.
Dark skin patches on the face (melasma). Early research shows that applying moisturizer containing 5% niacinamide or 2% niacinamide with 2% tranexamic acid for 4-8 weeks helps lighten skin in people with darkened patches of skin.
Cancer that starts in white blood cells (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Early research shows that taking niacinamide as part of treatment with a drug called vorinostat might help people with lymphoma go in to remission.
A skin condition that causes redness on the face (rosacea). Early research shows that taking tablets containing niacinamide and other ingredients for 8 weeks improves skin appearance in people with rosacea. 
Rough, scaly skin on the scalp and face (seborrheic dermatitis). Early research shows that applying a cream containing 4% niacinamide can reduce redness and scaling of the skin in people with seborrheic dermatitis. 
Alcoholism.
Alzheimer disease.
Arthritis.
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occur normally with age.
Depression.
High blood pressure.
Motion sickness.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate niacinamide for these uses.

","Niacinamide can be made from niacin in the body. Niacin is converted to niacinamide when it is taken in amounts greater than what is needed by the body. Niacinamide is easily dissolved in water and is well-absorbed when taken by mouth.

Niacinamide is required for the proper function of fats and sugars in the body and to maintain healthy cells.

Unlike niacin, niacinamide has no beneficial effects on fats and should not be used for treating high cholesterol or high fat levels in the blood.
","When taken by mouth: Niacinamide is LIKELY SAFE for most adults. Unlike niacin, niacinamide does not cause flushing. However, niacinamide might cause minor side effects such as stomach upset, gas, dizziness, rash, itching, and other problems. 

When doses of over 3 grams per day of niacinamide are taken, more serious side effects can happen. These include liver problems or high blood sugar.
When applied to the skin: Niacinamide is POSSIBLY SAFE. Niacinamide cream might cause mild burning, itching, or redness. 




Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Niacinamide is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amounts. The recommended amount of niacin for pregnant or breast-feeding women is 30 mg per day for women under 18 years of age, and 35 mg for women over 18 years of age.
Children: Niacinamide is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in the recommended amounts for children. 
Allergies: Niacinamide can make allergies more severe because they cause histamine, the chemical responsible for allergic symptoms, to be released.
Diabetes: Niacinamide might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacinamide should check their blood sugar carefully.
Gallbladder disease: Niacinamide might make gallbladder disease worse.
Gout: Large amounts of niacinamide might bring on gout.
Kidney dialysis: Taking niacinamide seems to increase the risk of low blood-platelet levels in people with kidney failure who are on dialysis. 
Liver disease: Niacinamide might increase liver damage. Don't use it if you have liver disease.
Stomach or intestinal ulcers: Niacinamide might make ulcers worse. Don't use it if you have ulcers.
Surgery: Niacinamide might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking niacinamide at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Oat is a plant. People use the seed (oat), leaves and stem (oat straw), and bran (the outer layer of whole oats) to make medicine.

Oat bran and whole oats are used for high blood pressure; high cholesterol; diabetes; and digestion problems including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diarrhea, and constipation. They are also used for preventing heart disease, gallstones, colon cancer, and stomach cancer.

Oats are most commonly used to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for OATS are as follows:Likely effective for...
Heart disease. Oat bran contains high amounts of fiber. Foods high in fiber can be used as part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol to prevent heart disease. In fact, food products containing whole oats that provide 750 mg of soluble fiber per serving can be labeled with the health claim that the product may reduce the risk of heart disease when included as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Lowering cholesterol. Eating oats, oat bran, and other soluble fibers can modestly reduce total and ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat. For each gram of soluble fiber (beta-glucan) consumed, total cholesterol decreases by about 1.42 mg/dL and LDL by about 1.23 mg/dL. Eating 3-10 grams of soluble fiber can reduce total cholesterol by about 4-14 mg/dL. But there's a limit. Doses of soluble fiber greater than 10 grams per day don't seem to increase effectiveness.

Eating three bowls of oatmeal (28 gram servings) daily can decrease total cholesterol by about 5 mg/dL. Oat bran products (oat bran muffins, oat bran flakes, oat bran Os, etc.) may vary in their ability to lower cholesterol, depending on the total soluble fiber content. Whole oat products might be more effective in lowering LDL and total cholesterol than foods containing oat bran plus beta-glucan soluble fiber.

The FDA recommends that approximately 3 grams of soluble fiber be taken daily to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, this recommendation doesn't match research findings; according to controlled clinical studies, at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber daily is needed to lower cholesterol.


Possibly effective for...
Diabetes . Eating oats and oat bran for 6 weeks decreases before-meal blood sugar, 24-hour blood sugar, and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Eating 50-100 grams of oats in place of other carbohydrates reduces after-meal blood sugar in some people. Long-term, eating 100 grams of oats in place of other carbohydrates has the most long-lasting effect on blood glucose. Furthermore, there is some evidence that consuming 50 grams of oat bran daily, which contains 25 grams of soluble fiber, might be more effective than the standard moderate fiber diet of 24 grams daily recommended by the American Diabetes Association.
Stomach cancer. People who eat high-fiber foods, such as oats and oat bran, seem to have a lower risk of stomach cancer.

Possibly ineffective for...
Colon cancer. People who eat oat bran or oats don't seem to have a lower risk of colon cancer. Also, eating oat bran fiber isn't linked with a lower risk of colon tumor recurrence.
High blood pressure. Eating oats as oatmeal or oat cereal doesn't reduce blood pressure in men with slightly high blood pressure.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Mental function. Early research shows that taking a specific wild green-oats extract (Neuravena) might improve the speed of mental performance in healthy adults. 
Dry skin. Using lotion containing colloidal oat extract seems to improve dry skin. 
Preventing fat redistribution syndrome in people with HIV disease. Eating a high-fiber diet, including oats, with adequate energy and protein might prevent fat accumulation in people with HIV. A one-gram increase in total dietary fiber may decrease the risk of fat accumulation by 7%.
Ulcerative colitis. Early research shows that taking a specific oat-based product (Profermin) by mouth can reduce symptoms and prevent recurrence of ulcerative colitis. 
Itchy skin in people with kidney disease. Early research shows that applying lotion containing oats reduces skin itching in people with this condition. The lotion seems to work as well as taking the antihistamine hydroxyzine 10 mg.

More evidence is needed to rate oats for these uses.","Oats might help reduce cholesterol and blood sugar levels and control appetite by causing a feeling of fullness. Oat bran might work by blocking the absorption from the gut of substances that contribute to heart disease, high cholesterol, and diabetes. When applied to the skin, oats appear to reduce swelling.","Oat bran and whole oats are LIKELY SAFE for most people when used in the amount found in foods. Oats can cause intestinal gas and bloating. To minimize side effects, start with a low dose and increase slowly to the desired amount. Your body will get used to oat bran and the side effects will likely go away.

Lotion containing oat extract is POSSIBLY SAFE to use on the skin. However, putting oat-containing products on the skin can cause some people to break out.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Oat bran and whole oats are LIKELY SAFE when ingested by pregnant and breast-feeding women in the amounts found in foods. 
Difficulty swallowing food or chewing problems: If you have swallowing problems (from a stroke, for example) or if you have trouble chewing because of missing teeth or poorly fitting dentures, it's best to avoid eating oats. Poorly chewed oats can cause blockage of the intestine.
Disorders of the digestive tract including the esophagus, stomach, and intestines: Avoid eating oat products. Digestive problems that could extend the length of time it takes for your food to be digested could allow oats to block your intestine.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/814.html,"Mackie AR, Bajka BH, Rigby NM, et al.

Olive is a tree. People use the oil from the fruit and seeds, water extracts of the fruit, and the leaves to make medicine.

Olive oil is used to prevent heart attack and stroke (cardiovascular disease), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and migraine headache.

Some people use olive oil to treat constipation, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, blood vessel problems associated with diabetes, and pain associated ear infections, arthritis, and gallbladder disease. Olive oil is also used to treat jaundice, intestinal gas, and meteorism (swelling of the abdomen due to gas). It is also used to destroy the bacteria that causes some ulcers, helicobacter pylori.

Some people also use olive oil to boost bacteria in the gut and as a ""cleanser"" or ""purifier.""

Olive oil is applied to the skin (used topically) for earwax, ringing ears (tinnitus), pain in the ears, lice, wounds, minor burns, psoriasis, stretch marks due to pregnancy, eczema, jock itch, ringworm, a skin disease caused tinea versicolor, and for protecting the skin from ultraviolet (UV) damage after sun exposure. In the mouth it is used to reduce gum disease.

In foods, olive oil is used as a cooking and salad oil.

In manufacturing, olive oil is used to make soaps, commercial plasters and liniments; and to delay setting in dental cements.

Olive oil is classified, in part, according to acid content, measured as free oleic acid. Extra virgin olive oil contains a maximum of 1% free oleic acid, virgin olive oil contains 2%, and ordinary olive oil contains 3.3%. Unrefined olive oils with more than 3.3% free oleic acid are considered ""unfit for human consumption.""

Olive oil that is mixed with a gas called ozone (ozonated olive oil) is promoted for everything from bee stings and insect bites to bacterial and fungal skin infections to cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows the use of ozone to fight bacteria on food, including meat and poultry, but the food industry has been slow to adopt it. Ozone is extremely unstable and must be produced on site. Topical olive oil products that are claimed to contain ozone are unlikely to remain stable during shipping. There are no clinically proven medical uses of ozone or ozonated olive oil. Antibacterial agents that are applied to the skin are a better choice.

Olive leaf is used for treating viral, bacterial, and other infections including influenza, swine flu, the common cold, meningitis, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), encephalitis, herpes, shingles, HIV/ARC/AIDS, and hepatitis B. Olive leaf is also used for pneumonia; chronic fatigue: tuberculosis (TB); gonorrhea; fever; malaria; dengue; ""blood poisoning"" (bacterial infections in the bloodstream); severe diarrhea; and infections in the teeth, ears, and urinary tract, and infections following surgery. Other uses include high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, hay fever, improving kidney and digestive function, and increasing urine flow.

Water extracts of olive fruit pulp are used for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for OLIVE are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Breast cancer. Women who consume more olive oil in their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing breast cancer.
Heart disease. Replacing saturated fats in the diet with olive oil can reduce risk factors for heart disease and stroke, including reducing blood pressure and cholesterol. Adding olive oil to the diet seems to help prevent a first heart attack and reduces death due to heart disease. Some research shows a high dietary intake of olive oil (54 grams/day; about 4 tablespoons) can reduced the risk of first heart attack by 82% when compared with a low intake of 7 grams of olive oil or less per day. Including 1 liter per week of extra-virgin olive oil in a Mediterranean diet for around 5 years also seems to help prevent heart attacks and strokes in people over age 55 who have diabetes or a combination of heart disease risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, high LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, low HDL (""good"") cholesterol, overweight, or with a family history of heart disease). A Mediterranean diet has high intakes of fruit, nuts, vegetables and cereals, moderate intake of fish and poultry, and low intake of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, and sweets. 

The FDA now allows labels on olive oil and on food that contains olive oil to state that limited, but not conclusive evidence, suggests that consuming 23 grams/day (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of heart disease. The FDA also allows products containing certain forms of olive oil to claim that consuming these products can reduce the risk of heart disease.
Constipation. Taking olive oil by mouth can help to soften stools in people with constipation.
Diabetes. People who eat higher amounts of olive oil (about 15-20 grams per day) seem to have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Eating more than 20 grams per day is not linked with additional benefit. Research also shows that olive oil can improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Olive oil in a Mediterranean-type diet might also reduce the risk of ""hardening of the arteries"" (atherosclerosis) compared to polyunsaturated oils such as sunflower oil in people with diabetes.
High cholesterol. Using olive oil in the diet instead of saturated fat can reduce total cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. However, some research suggests other dietary oils such as sunflower and rapeseed (canola) might reduce ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and another type of cholesterol called apolipoprotein B better than olive oil.
High blood pressure. Adding generous amounts of extra virgin olive oil to the diet and continuing with the usual treatments for high blood pressure can improve blood pressure over 6 months in people with high blood pressure. In some cases, people with mild to moderate high blood pressure can actually lower their dose of blood pressure medication or even stop taking medication altogether. However, do not adjust your medications without your healthcare provider's supervision. Taking olive leaf extract also seems to lower blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure.
Possibly ineffective for...Earwax. Applying olive oil to the skin does not appear to soften earwax.
Ear infection (otitis media). Applying olive oil to the skin does not appear to reduce pain in children with ear infections.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil along with standard care seems to improve eczema.
Cancer. People who eat more olive oil seem to have a lower risk of developing cancer. But dietary intake of olive oil is not linked with a lower risk of cancer-related death.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research suggests that people who consume more olive oil in their diet might have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer.
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Early research shows that taking 30 grams of olive oil before breakfast for 2-4 weeks helps get rid of Helicobacter pylori infections in some people.  
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions such as high blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, or high blood sugar that can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or diabetes. Taking olive leaf extract seems to help control of blood sugar in men with this condition. But it does not seem to reduce body weight, cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. 
Migraine. Taking olive oil daily for 2 months seems to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches. However, more research is needed.
Obesity. Taking olive oil daily for 9 weeks as part of a low-calorie diet seems to help with fat loss, but not overall weight loss.  
Osteoarthritis. Developing research shows that taking a freeze-dried water extract of olive fruit or an extract of olive leaf decreases pain and increases mobility in people with osteoarthritis.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking olive leaf extract daily along with calcium might slow down bone loss in postmenopausal women with low bone density.
Ovarian cancer. Research suggests that women who consume more olive oil in their diet have a lower risk of developing ovarian cancer.
A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Using ozonated olive oil in the mouth, alone or following mouth treatment such as teeth scaling and root planing, seems to reduce the build-up of plaque and prevent bleeding and inflammation of the gums.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin along with standard care can improve psoriasis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some research suggests that people whose diet includes a high amount of olive oil have a lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. However, early research shows that taking a water extract of olive fruit does not significantly improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Stretch marks. Early research shows that applying a small amount of olive oil to the stomach twice daily starting early in the second semester does not prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.
Ringworm (Tinea corporis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating ringworm.
Jock itch (Tinea cruris). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating jock itch.
A common fungal infection of the skin (Tinea versicolor). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating yeast infection.

 
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of olive for these uses.","Fatty acids in olive oil seem to decrease cholesterol levels and have anti-inflammatory effects. Olive leaf and olive oil might lower blood pressure. Olive might also be able to kill microbes, such as bacteria and fungus.","When taken by mouth: Olive oil is LIKELY SAFE when taken appropriately by mouth. Olive oil can be used safely as 14% of total daily calories. This is equal to about 2 tablespoons (28 grams) daily. Up to 1 liter per week of extra-virgin olive oil has been used safely as part of a Mediterranean-style diet for up to 5.8 years. Olive oil might cause nausea in a very small number of people. Olive leaf extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken appropriately by mouth. 

There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of olive leaf when taken by mouth.
When applied to the skin: Olive oil is LIKELY SAFE when applied to the skin. Delayed allergic responses and contact dermatitis have been reported. When used in the mouth following dental treatment, the mouth may feel more sensitive.
When inhaled: Olive trees produce pollen that can cause seasonal respiratory allergy in some people.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if olive is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Do not use amounts greater than the amount commonly found in foods. 

Diabetes: Olive oil might lower blood sugar. People with diabetes should check their blood sugar when using olive oil.
Surgery: Olive oil might affect blood sugar. Using olive oil might affect blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking olive oil 2 weeks before surgery.

Omega-6 fatty acids are types of fats. Some types are found in vegetable oils, including corn, evening primrose seed, safflower, and soybean oils. Other types of omega-6 fatty acids are found in black currant seed, borage seed, and evening primrose oils.

Omega-6 fatty acids are used for many conditions, but so far, the best information that science can provide is that putting arachidonic acid, a particular omega-6 fatty acid, in infant formula doesn't improve infant development. Not enough research has been done on omega-6 fatty acids to judge whether or not they are effective for other uses.

Most of the information we have on omega-6 fatty acid supplements comes from studying specific omega-6 fatty acids or plant oils containing omega-6 fatty acids. See the separate listings for gamma linolenic acid, as well as evening primrose, borage, and black currant.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDS are as follows:Possibly ineffective for...
Multiple sclerosis (MS). Taking omega-6 fatty acids does not seem to prevent the progression of MS.
Infant development. Adding the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid along with an omega-3 fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to infant formula does not seem to improve brain development, vision, or growth in infants. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early research suggests that taking a combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids twice daily for 3-6 months does not improve symptoms of ADHD. 
Heart disease. Population research suggests that different kinds of omega-6 fatty acids affect the heart and blood vessels differently. In the body, some kinds appear to be protective whereas others might worsen the disease. However, the omega-6 fatty acids shown to be more harmful when found in higher amounts in the body are not the ones typically eaten in the diet or found in supplements. How our body makes these types of omega-6 fatty acids is dependent on other health and lifestyle factors. 
A lung disease called COPD. Early research suggests that breathing problems are worse in people with COPD who eat large amounts of omega-6 fatty acids. 
Developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Early research suggests that taking a combination of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids for 3 months can improve reading, spelling, and behavior, but not coordination or movement in children with DCD.
Diabetes. Early research suggests that people who have more linoleic acid, a type of omega-6 fatty acid, in their body are less likely to develop diabetes than people with less.
Diarrhea in infants. Early research suggests that infants fed formula supplemented with an omega-6 fatty acid called arachidonic acid and an omega-3 fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for the first year of life have a lower risk of diarrhea.
Respiratory illness in infants. Early research suggests that infants fed formula supplemented with an omega-6 fatty acid called arachidonic acid and an omega-3 fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for the first year of life have a lower risk of lung problems.
Reducing the risk of heart disease.
Lowering bad cholesterol levels (LDL).
Increasing good cholesterol levels (HDL).
Reducing the risk of cancer.
Eyelid swelling.
To improve recovery after laser eye surgery.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of omega-6 fatty acids for these uses.","Omega-6 fatty acids are found everywhere in the body. They help with the function of all cells. If people don't eat enough omega-6 fatty acids, cells won't work properly. Too much omega-6 fatty acids can change the way cells react and have harmful effects on cells in the heart and blood vessels. ","Omega-6 fatty acids are LIKELY SAFE when consumed by adults and children over the age of 12 months as part of the diet in amounts between 5% and 10% of daily calories. However, there is not enough reliable information available to know if omega-6 fatty acids are safe to use as medicine.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Omega-6 fatty acids are LIKELY SAFE when consumed as part of the diet in amounts between 5% and 10% of daily calories. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking omega-6 fatty acid supplements if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
High triglycerides (a type of cholesterol): Omega-6 fatty acids can raise triglyceride levels.

Oregano is an herb with olive-green leaves and purple flowers. It grows 1-3 feet tall and is closely related to mint, thyme, marjoram, basil, sage, and lavender.

Oregano is native to warm western and southwestern Europe and the Mediterranean region. Turkey is one of the largest exporters of oregano. It now grows on most continents and under a variety of conditions. Countries known for producing high-quality oregano essential oils include Greece, Israel, and Turkey. 

Outside of the U.S. and Europe, plants referred to as ""oregano"" may be other species of Origanum, or other members of the Lamiaceae family.

Oregano is taken by mouth respiratory tract disorders such as coughs, asthma, allergies, croup, and bronchitis. It is also taken by mouth for stomach disorders such as heartburn, bloating, and parasites. Oregano is also taken by mouth for painful menstrual cramps, rheumatoid arthritis, urinary tract disorders including urinary tract infections (UTIs), headaches, diabetes, bleeding after having a tooth pulled, heart conditions, and high cholesterol.

Oregano oil is applied to the skin for skin conditions including acne, athlete's foot, dandruff, canker sores, warts, wounds, ringworm, rosacea, and psoriasis; as well as for insect and spider bites, gum disease, toothaches, muscle and joint pain, and varicose veins. Oregano oil is also applied to the skin as an insect repellent.

In foods and beverages, oregano is used as a culinary spice and a food preservative.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for OREGANO are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Parasites in the intestines. Some early research shows that taking 200 mg of a specific oregano leaf oil product (ADP, Biotics Research Corporation, Rosenberg, Texas) by mouth three times daily with meals for 6 weeks can kill certain types of parasites; however, these parasites usually do not require medical treatment.
Wound healing. Early research suggests that applying an oregano extract to the skin twice daily for up to 14 days after a minor skin surgery might reduce the risk of infection and improve scars.

More evidence is needed to rate oregano for these uses.","Oregano contains chemicals that might help reduce cough and spasms. Oregano also might help digestion by increasing bile flow and fighting against some bacteria, viruses, fungi, intestinal worms, and other parasites.","Oregano leaf and oregano oil are LIKELY SAFE when taken in amounts commonly found in food. Oregano leaf is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth or applied to the skin appropriately as medicine. Mild side effects include stomach upset. Oregano might also cause an allergic reaction in people who have an allergy to plants in the Lamiaceae family. Oregano oil should not be applied to the skin in concentrations greater than 1% as this might cause irritation.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Oregano is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in medicinal amounts during pregnancy. There is concern that taking oregano in amounts larger than food amounts might cause miscarriage. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking oregano if you are breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Bleeding disorders: Oregano might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Allergies: Oregano can cause reactions in people allergic to Lamiaceae family plants, including basil, hyssop, lavender, marjoram, mint, and sage.
Diabetes: Oregano might lower blood sugar levels. People with diabetes should use oregano cautiously.
Surgery: Oregano might increase the risk of bleeding. People who use oregano should stop 2 weeks before surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/644.html,"Teixeira B, Marques A, Ramos C, et al.

Oscillococcinum is a brand name homeopathic product manufactured by Boiron Laboratories. Similar homeopathic products are found in other brands.

Homeopathic products are extreme dilutions of some active ingredient. They are often so diluted that they don't contain any active medicine. Homeopathic products are permitted for sale in the U.S. due to legislation passed in 1938 sponsored by a homeopathic physician who was also a senator. The law still requires that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allow the sale of products listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States. However, homeopathic preparations are not held to the same safety and effectiveness standards as conventional medicines.

Oscillococcinum is used for symptoms of the common cold, the flu, and H1N1 (swine) flu.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for OSCILLOCOCCINUM are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Flu (influenza). There is no reliable evidence that taking oscillococcinum can prevent the flu. However, in people with flu symptoms, there is some evidence that oscillococcinum might help people get over the flu faster, but only by 6 or 7 hours. This may not be of much importance. The reliability of this finding is also questionable due to flaws in the study design and bias related to the company that makes the product.
Common cold.
H1N1 (swine) flu.


More evidence is needed to rate oscillococcinum for these uses.
","Oscillococcinum is a homeopathic product. Homeopathy is a system of medicine established in the 19th century by a German physician named Samuel Hahnemann. Its basic principles are that ""like treats like"" and ""potentiation through dilution."" For example, in homeopathy, influenza would be treated with an extreme dilution of a substance that normally causes influenza when taken in high doses.
A French physician discovered oscillococcinum while investigating the Spanish flu in 1917. But he was mistaken that his ""oscillococci"" were the cause of the flu.

Practitioners of homeopathy believe that more dilute preparations are more potent. Many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that they contain little or no active ingredient. Therefore, most homeopathic products are not expected to act like drugs, or have drug interactions or other harmful effects. Any beneficial effects are controversial and cannot be explained by current scientific methods.

Dilutions of 1 to 10 are designated by an ""X."" So a 1X dilution = 1:10 or 1 part of an active ingredient in 10 parts of water; 3X = 1:1000; 6X = 1:1,000,000. Dilutions of 1 to 100 are designated by a ""C."" So a 1C dilution = 1:100; 3C = 1:1,000,000. Dilutions of 24X or 12C or more contain zero molecules of the original active ingredient. Oscillococcinum is diluted to 200C.","Oscillococcinum seems to be safe for most people. This is a homeopathic preparation. This means that it does not contain any active ingredient. Most experts believe that it will have no beneficial effect and also no negative side effects. However, cases of severe swelling, including swelling of the tongue, and headache have been reported for some people taking oscillococcinum.

Palm oil is obtained from the fruit of the oil palm tree.

Palm oil is used for preventing vitamin A deficiency, cancer, brain disease, and aging. It is also used to treat malaria, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, dementia, and cyanide poisoning. Palm oil is used for weight loss and for increasing the body's metabolism. 

As food, palm oil is used for frying. It is also an ingredient in many processed foods.

Industrially, palm oil is used for manufacturing cosmetics, soaps, toothpaste, waxes, lubricants, and ink. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PALM OIL are as follows:Likely effective for...Preventing or treating a lack of vitamin A (vitamin A deficiency). Research shows that adding red palm oil to the diets of pregnant women and children in developing countries reduces the chance of having too little vitamin A. It also seems to help increase vitamin A levels in those who have too little. Red palm oil seems to be as effective as taking a vitamin A supplement for preventing or treating low levels of vitamin A. Doses of about 8 grams or less per day seem to work best. Higher doses don't seem to have more benefit.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Malaria. Early research suggests that eating palm oil in the diet does not seem to decrease symptoms of malaria in children under 5 years of age in developing countries.
Anti-aging.
Brain disease.
Cancer.
Cyanide poisoning.
High blood pressure.
Weight loss agent.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of palm oil for these uses.
",Palm oil contains saturated and unsaturated fats. Some types of palm oil contain vitamin E and beta-carotene. These types of palm oil might have antioxidant effects.,"Palm oil is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in food amounts. But palm oil contains a type of fat that can increase cholesterol levels. So people should avoid eating palm oil in excess. Palm oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when used as a medicine, short-term. Taking 9-12 grams daily for up to 6 months seems to be safe.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Palm oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken as a medicine during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Not enough is known about the use of palm oil as medicine during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.
Children: Palm oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth as a medicine. Palm oil has been used for up to 6 months in children under 5 years of age and for up to 12 months in children 5 years of age and older.
High cholesterol: Palm oil contains a type of fat that can increase cholesterol levels. Regularly eating meals containing palm oil can increase levels of ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This might be a problem for people who already have high cholesterol.

Pantothenic acid is a vitamin, also known as vitamin B5. It is widely found in both plants and animals including meat, vegetables, cereal grains, legumes, eggs, and milk.

Vitamin B5 is commercially available as D-pantothenic acid, as well as dexpanthenol and calcium pantothenate, which are chemicals made in the lab from D-pantothenic acid.

Pantothenic acid is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations. Vitamin B complex generally includes vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin/niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and folic acid. However, some products do not contain all of these ingredients and some may include others, such as biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), choline bitartrate, and inositol.

Pantothenic acid has a long list of uses, although there isn't enough scientific evidence to determine whether it is effective for most of these uses. People take pantothenic acid for treating dietary deficiencies, acne, alcoholism, allergies, baldness, asthma, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, burning feet syndrome, yeast infections, heart failure, carpal tunnel syndrome, breathing problems, celiac disease, colitis, pink eye (conjunctivitis), seizures, and bladder infections. It is also taken by mouth for dandruff, depression, diabetic nerve pain, enhancing immune function, improving athletic performance, tongue infections, gray hair, headache, hyperactivity, low blood sugar, trouble sleeping (insomnia), irritability, low blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, leg cramps associated with pregnancy or alcoholism, general nerve pain, and obesity.


Pantothenic acid is also taken by mouth for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), enlarged prostate, protection against mental and physical stress and anxiety, reducing side effects of thyroid therapy for people with decreased function of the thyroid gland, reducing signs of aging, reducing the risk of getting a cold or other infection, delayed growth, shingles, skin disorders, stimulating adrenal glands, sore mouth (stomatitis), chronic fatigue syndrome, toxicity related to medications such as salicylates or streptomycin, dizziness, constipation, and wound healing. It is also used following surgery to improve movement in the intestines and to reduce sore throat.


People apply dexpanthenol, which is made from pantothenic acid, to the skin for itching, promoting healing of mild eczemas and other skin conditions, insect stings, bites, poison ivy, diaper rash, and acne. It is also applied topically for preventing and treating skin reactions to radiation therapy. It is also applie to reduce skin reactions to radiotherapy treatment, for dry eyes and eye trauma, and for sprains.

Dexpanthenol is given with a needle in to the vein or muscle to improve intestinal movement (intestinal peristalsis), possibly following surgery of the gut, for abdominal bloating (distension) due to reduced intestinal function, and for gas following surgery or pregnancy.

A nasal spray containing dexpanthenol is used to reduce the feeling of having a stuffed nose (nasal obstruction) and to reduce a runny nose (nasal discharge).
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PANTOTHENIC ACID are as follows:Effective for...Pantothenic acid deficiency. Taking pantothenic acid by mouth prevents and treats pantothenic acid deficiency.Possibly ineffective for...Skin reactions from radiation therapy. Applying dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, to areas of irritated skin does not seem to reduce skin reactions caused by radiation therapy. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Athletic performance. Some research suggests that taking pantothenic acid in combination with pantethine and thiamine does not improve muscular strength or endurance in well-trained athletes.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is conflicting evidence regarding the usefulness of pantothenic acid in combination with large doses of other vitamins for the treatment of ADHD.
Constipation. Early research suggests that taking dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, by mouth daily or receiving dexpanthenol shots can help treat constipation.
Eye trauma. Early research shows that applying drops containing dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, reduces eye pain and discomfort after surgery to the retinal. But applying dexpanthenol ointment doesn't seem to help improve wound healing after surgery to the cornea.
Osteoarthritis. Early research suggests that pantothenic acid (given as calcium pantothenate) does not reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis.
Recovery of the bowels after surgery. Taking pantothenic acid or dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, does not seem to improve bowel function after gallbladder removal.
Sore throat after surgery. Taking dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, by mouth might reduce sore throat symptoms after surgery.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research suggests that pantothenic acid (given as calcium pantothenate) does not reduce the symptoms of arthritis in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Nasal dryness. Early research suggests that using a specific spray (Nasicur) that contains dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, helps relieve nasal dryness.
Sinus infection. Early research suggests that using a nasal spray containing dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, after sinus surgery reduces discharge from the nose, but not other symptoms.
Skin irritation. Applying dexpanthenol, a chemical similar to pantothenic acid, does not seem to prevent skin irritation caused by a certain chemical in soap. But it might help treat this type of skin irritation.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of pantothenic acid for these uses.","Pantothenic acid is important for our bodies to properly use carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids and for healthy skin.","Pantothenic acid is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. The recommended amount for adults is 5 mg per day. Even larger amounts (up to 10 grams) seem to be safe for some people. But taking larger amounts increases the chance of having side effects such as diarrhea.


Dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid, is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin, used as a nasal spray, or injected as a shot into the muscle appropriately, short-term.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Pantothenic acid is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in recommended amounts of 6 mg per day during pregnancy and 7 mg per day during breast-feeding. However, it is not known if taking more than this amount is safe. Avoid using larger amounts of pantothenic acid.
Children: Dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid, is POSSIBLY SAFE for children when applied to the skin.
Hemophila: Do not take dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid, if you have hemophila. It might increase the risk of bleeding.
Stomach blockage: Do not receive injections of dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid, if you have a gastrointestinal blockage.
Ulcerative colitis: Use enemas containing dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid, cautiously if you have ulcerative colitis.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/853.html,"Williams RJ, Lyman CM, Goodyear GH, Truesdail JH, Holaday D.

Papaya is a plant. The leaves and fruit are used to make medicine.

Papaya is taken by mouth to prevent cancer, treat diabetes, and prevent recurrence of a viral infection called human papilloma virus (HPV). But there is little scientific evidence to support these uses.

Papaya contains a chemical called papain, which is commonly used as a meat tenderizer.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PAPAYA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Cancer. Population research has found that eating papaya might prevent gallbladder and colorectal cancers in some people.
Diabetes. Early research suggests that consuming fermented papaya fruit can reduce blood sugar levels before and after meals in people with type 2 diabetes.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Population research has found that eating papaya fruit at least once per week might reduce the chance of getting a persistent HPV infection compared to never eating papaya fruit.
Gum disease. Early research shows that applying a gel containing fermented papaya into spaces around teeth called periodontal pockets can reduce gum bleeding, plaque, and gum inflammation in people with gum disease.
Wound healing. Early research shows that applying a dressing containing papaya fruit to the edges of a reopened surgical wound reduces healing time and length of hospitalization compared to treating the reopened wound with a hydrogen peroxide dressing.
Stomach and intestine problems.
Parasite infections.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of papaya for these uses.","Papaya contains a chemical called papain. Papain breaks down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. That’s why it works as a meat tenderizer. However, papain is changed by digestive juices, so there is some question about whether it could be effective as a medicine when taken by mouth.

Papaya also contains a chemical called carpain. Carpain seems to be able to kill certain parasites, and it might affect the central nervous system.

Papaya also seems to have antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-stimulating effects.","Papaya is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth in amounts commonly found in foods. 

Papaya is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth as medicine. 

Papaya is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in large amounts or when applied to the skin as papaya latex. Papaya latex contains papain. Taking large amounts of papain by mouth may damage the esophagus, which is the food tube in the throat. Applying papaya latex to the skin can cause severe irritation and allergic reactions in some people.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Papaya is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Do not take papaya by mouth in medicinal amounts if you are pregnant. There is some evidence that unprocessed papain, one of the chemicals found in papaya, might poison the fetus or cause birth defects. Not enough is known about the safety of papaya during breast-feeding. It is best to avoid taking it in amounts higher than normal food amounts.
Diabetes: Papaya that has been fermented can lower blood sugar. People with diabetes who are taking medications to lower their blood sugar should pay close attention to their blood sugar as adjustments to medications might be needed.
Low blood sugar: Papaya that has been fermented can lower blood sugar. Taking this form of papaya might make blood sugar too low in people who already have low blood sugar.
Underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism): There is concern that eating large amounts of papaya might make this condition worse. 
Latex allergy: If you are allergic to latex, there is a good chance you are also be allergic to papaya. If you have a latex allergy, avoid eating papaya or taking products that contain papaya.
Papain allergy: Papaya contains papain. If you are allergic to papain, avoid eating papaya or taking products that contain papaya.
Surgery: Papaya that has been fermented can lower blood sugar. In theory, this form of papaya might affect blood sugary during and after surgery. If you are taking papaya, you should stop 2 weeks before surgery.

Pau d'arco is a tree that grows in the Amazon rainforest and other tropical regions of South and Central America. Pau d'arco wood is dense and resists rotting. The name ""pau d'arco"" is Portuguese for ""bow tree,"" an appropriate term considering the tree's use by the native peoples of South America for making hunting bows. The bark and wood are used to make medicine.

People use pau d'arco for conditions such as infections, cancer, diabetes, stomach ulcers, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Using pau d'arco can also be unsafe, especially at higher doses.

Commercial products containing pau d'arco are available in capsule, tablet, extract, powder, and tea forms. But sometimes it's hard to know what is in pau d'arco products. Some studies have shown that some pau d'arco products sold in Canada, Brazil, and Portugal do not contain the active ingredients in the correct amounts.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PAU D'ARCO are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Anemia.

Peanut oil is the oil from the seed, also called the nut, of the peanut plant. Peanut oil is used to make medicine.

Peanut oil is used by mouth to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease and cancer. Peanut oil is sometimes applied directly to the skin for arthritis, joint pain, dry skin, eczema, and other skin conditions. But there is limited scientific evidence to support these uses.

Peanut oil is commonly used in cooking.

Pharmaceutical companies use peanut oil in various products they prepare. Peanut oil is also used in skin care products and baby care products.

Pennyroyal is a plant. The oil and leaves are used to make medicine. Throughout history, both American pennyroyal and European pennyroyal have been used interchangeably as a source of oil.
Despite serious safety concerns, pennyroyal is used for colds, pneumonia, and other breathing problems. It is also used for stomach pains, gas, intestinal disorders, and liver and gallbladder problems.
Women use it to start or regulate their menstrual periods, or to cause an abortion.
Pennyroyal is also used to control muscle spasms, cause sweating, and increase urine production.
Some people use it as a stimulant and to counteract weakness.
Pennyroyal is applied to the skin to kill germs, keep insects away, and treat skin diseases. It is also used topically for gout, venomous bites, and mouth sores; and as a flea-killing bath.
In foods, pennyroyal is used for flavoring.
In manufacturing, pennyroyal oil is used as a dog and cat flea repellent; and as a fragrance for detergents, perfumes, and soaps.

It can cause serious liver and kidney damage, as well as nervous system damage. Other side effects include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, burning of the throat, fever, confusion, restlessness, seizures, dizziness, vision and hearing problems, high blood pressure, abortion, lung failure, and brain damage.

Repeated use of an alcoholic pennyroyal leaf extract over a period of 2 weeks has been linked to a death.

Not enough is known about the safety of using pennyroyal leaf as a tea.
Special precautions & warnings:

Pennyroyal is LIKELY UNSAFE for anyone to use, but it is especially unsafe for children and people with the following conditions.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, it is LIKELY UNSAFE to take pennyroyal by mouth or apply it to your skin. There is some evidence that pennyroyal oil can cause abortions by causing the uterus to contract. But the dose needed for this effect could kill the mother or cause her life-long kidney and liver damage.

Pennyroyal leaf tea seems to be able to start menstruation, which could also threaten a pregnancy.
Children: It is LIKELY UNSAFE to give children pennyroyal by mouth. Two infants developed serious liver and nervous system injuries after taking pennyroyal, and one infant died.
Kidney disease: The oil in pennyroyal can irritate the kidney and make existing kidney disease worse.
Liver disease: The oil in pennyroyal can cause liver damage and might make existing liver disease worse.

Phosphate salts refers to many different combinations of the chemical phosphate with salts and minerals. Foods high in phosphate include dairy products, whole grain cereals, nuts, and certain meats. Phosphates found in dairy products and meats seem to be more easily absorbed by the body than phosphates found in cereal grains. Cola drinks contain a lot of phosphate - so much, in fact, that they can cause too much phosphate in the blood. 

People use phosphate salts for medicine. Be careful not to confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, which are very poisonous.

Phosphate salts are most commonly used for bowel cleansing, low blood levels of phosphate, constipation, high blood levels of calcium, and heartburn.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PHOSPHATE SALTS are as follows:Effective for...Preparing the bowel for a medical procedure. Taking sodium phosphate products by mouth before a colonoscopy procedure is effective for bowel cleansing. Some sodium phosphate products (OsmoPrep, Salix Pharmaceuticals; Visicol, Salix Pharmaceuticals) are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication. However, taking sodium phosphate can increase the risk of kidney damage in some people. For this reason, sodium phosphate products are no longer commonly used in the U.S. for bowel preparation.
Low phosphate levels in the blood. Taking sodium or potassium phosphate by mouth is effective for preventing or treating low phosphate levels in the blood. Intravenous phosphate salts may also treat low phosphate levels in the blood when used under the supervision of a physician.Likely effective for...Constipation. Sodium phosphate is an FDA-permitted over-the-counter (OTC) ingredient for the treatment of constipation. These products are taken by mouth or used as enemas.
Indigestion. Aluminum phosphate and calcium phosphate are FDA-permitted ingredients used in antacids.
High calcium levels in the blood. Taking phosphate salt (except calcium phosphate) by mouth is likely effective for treating high levels of calcium in the blood. But intravenous phosphate salts should not be used.
Possibly effective for...Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking potassium phosphate by mouth can help prevent calcium kidney stones from forming in patients with high urine levels of calcium.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Athletic performance. Some early research shows that taking sodium phosphate by mouth for 6 days before high-intensity cycling or sprinting can improve athletic performance. But other early research shows no benefit. More studies are needed in larger groups of people to see is sodium phosphate is really beneficial. Taking other phosphate salts such as calcium phosphate or potassium phosphate doesn't improve running or cycling performance. 
Diabetes complication (diabetic ketoacidosis). Early research shows that giving potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) does not improve a diabetes complication in which the body produces too many blood acids called ketones. People with this condition should only be given phosphates if they have low phosphate levels.
Osteoporosis. Research shows that taking calcium phosphate by mouth helps improve bone density of the hip and lower spine in women with osteoporosis. But it doesn't work better than other sources of calcium, such as calcium carbonate.
Complications that occur upon eating in people who were previously starving (refeeding syndrome). Early research shows that giving sodium and potassium phosphate intravenously (by IV) over 24 hours prevents refeeding syndrome when restarting nutrition in people who are severely malnourished or starved.
Sensitive teeth.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate phosphate salts for these uses.","Phosphates are normally absorbed from food and are important chemicals in the body. They are involved in cell structure, energy transport and storage, vitamin function, and numerous other processes essential to health. Phosphate salts can act as laxatives by causing more fluid to be drawn into the intestines and stimulating the gut to push out its contents faster.","Phosphate salts containing sodium, potassium, aluminum, or calcium are LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, or given intravenously (by IV) appropriately and short-term. Phosphate salts should only be used intravenously (by IV) under the supervision of a physician.

Phosphate salts (expressed as phosphorous) are POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken in doses higher than 4 grams per day for adults younger than 70 years of age and 3 grams per day for people who are older.

Regular long-term use can upset the balance of phosphates and other chemicals in the body and should be monitored by a healthcare professional to avoid serious side effects. Phosphate salts can irritate the digestive tract and cause stomach upset, diarrhea, constipation, headache, tiredness, and other problems.

Do not confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Phosphate salts from dietary sources are LIKELY SAFE for pregnant or breast-feeding women when used at the recommended allowances of 1250 mg daily for mothers between 14-18 years of age and 700 mg daily for those over 18 years of age. Other amounts are POSSIBLY UNSAFE and should only be used with the advice and ongoing care of a healthcare professional.
Children: Phosphate salts are LIKELY SAFE for children when used at the recommended daily allowances of 460 mg for children 1-3 years of age; 500 mg for children 4-8 years of age; and 1250 mg for children 9-18 years of age. Phosphate salts are  POSSIBLY UNSAFE if the amount of phosphate consumed (expressed as phosphorous) exceeds the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs are 3 grams per day for children 1-8 years; and 4 grams per day for children 9 years and older.
Heart disease: Avoid using phosphate salts that contain sodium if you have heart disease.
Fluid retention (edema): Avoid using phosphate salts that contain sodium if you have cirrhosis, heart failure, or other conditions that can cause edema.
High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia): Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body.
High levels of phosphate in the blood: People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely than other people to develop too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts. Use phosphate salts only with the advice and ongoing care of a healthcare professional if you have one of these conditions.

Propolis is a resin-like material made by bees from the buds of poplar and cone-bearing trees. Propolis is rarely available in its pure form. It is usually obtained from beehives and contains bee products. Bees use propolis to build their hives.


Propolis is used for swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). It is also used for burns, canker sores, diabetes, genital herpes, cold sores, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. 

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for PROPOLIS are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Most research shows that rinsing the mouth with a propolis mouth rinse helps heal sores caused by cancer drugs or dentures. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Burns. Early research shows that applying propolis to the skin every 3 days might help treat minor burns and prevent infections.
Canker sores. Early research shows that taking propolis by mouth daily for 6-13 months reduces canker sore outbreaks.
A painful disease transmitted by mosquitos (dengue fever). Research shows that taking propolis helps people with dengue fever leave the hospital faster. It is not known if propolis helps with symptoms of dengue fever. 
Diabetes. Research shows that taking propolis may slightly improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. But it doesn't seem to affect insulin levels or improve insulin resistance. 
Foot sores in people with diabetes. Early research shows that applying a propolis ointment to sores on the feet of people with diabetes might help the sores to heal faster. 
Genital herpes. Early research shows that applying a 3% propolis ointment four times daily for 10 days might improve healing of lesions in people with genital herpes. Some research suggests that it might heal lesions faster and more completely than the conventional treatment 5% acyclovir ointment.
A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). Early research suggests that using propolis in a gel or a rinse might help prevent or reduce signs of gum disease.
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Early research shows that taking 60 drops of a preparation containing Brazilian green propolis daily for 7 days does not reduce H. pylori infection.
Cold sores (herpes labialis). Early research shows that applying ointment containing 0.5% to 3% propolis five times daily improves healing time and reduce pain from cold sores.
Infection of the intestines by parasites. Early research suggests that taking a 30% propolis extract for 5 days can cure giardiasis in more people than the drug tinidazole.
Thrush. Early research suggests that using Brazilian green propolis extract four times daily for 7 days can prevent oral thrush in people with dentures.
A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Early research shows that deeply rinsing the gums with a propolis extract solution decreases bleeding of gums in people with periodontitis. Taking propolis by mouth helps to prevent loose teeth in people with this condition. But taking propolis by mouth doesn't seem to help with plaque or bleeding.
Athlete's foot (Tinea pedis). Early research shows that applying Brazilian green propolis to the skin decreases itching, peeling, and redness in students with athlete's foot.
Upper airway infection. There is some early evidence that propolis might help prevent or reduce the duration of common colds and other upper airway infections.
Swelling (inflammation) of the vagina (vaginitis). Early research suggests that applying a 5% propolis solution vaginally for 7 days can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in people with vaginal swelling.
Warts. Early research shows that taking propolis by mouth daily for up to 3 months cures warts in some people with plane and common warts. However, propolis does not seem to treat plantar warts.
Wound healing. Early research shows that using a propolis mouth rinse five times daily for 1 week might improve healing and reduce pain and swelling after mouth surgery. However, if people are already using a special dressing after dental surgery, using a propolis solution in the mouth does not seem to offer additional benefit. 
Improving immune response.
Infections.
Inflammation.
Nose and throat cancer.
Stomach and intestinal disorders.
Tuberculosis.
Ulcers.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate propolis for these uses.","Propolis seems to have activity against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It might also have anti-inflammatory effects and help skin heal.","When taken by mouth: Propolis is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. It can cause allergic reactions, especially in people who are allergic to bees or bee products. Lozenges containing propolis can cause irritation and mouth ulcers.
When applied to the skin: Propolis is POSSIBLY SAFE when applied to the skin appropriately. It can cause allergic reactions, especially in people who are allergic to bees or bee products. 

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn't enough reliable information to know if propolis is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Asthma: Some experts believe certain chemicals in propolis may make asthma worse. Avoid using propolis if you have asthma.
Bleeding conditions: A certain chemical in propolis might slow blood clotting. Taking propolis might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Allergies: Do not use propolis if you are allergic to bee by-products including honey, conifers, poplars, Peru balsam, and salicylates.
Surgery: A certain chemical in propolis might slow blood clotting. Taking propolis might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking propolis 2 weeks before surgery.

Raspberry ketone is a chemical from red raspberries, as well as kiwifruit, peaches, grapes, apples, other berries, vegetables such as rhubarb, and the bark of yew, maple, and pine trees. 

People take raspberry ketone by mouth for weight loss. It became popular for weight loss after it was mentioned on the Dr. Oz television show during the segment called ""Raspberry ketone: Miracle fat-burner in a bottle"" in February 2012.

People apply raspberry ketone to the skin for hair loss. 

Raspberry ketone is also used in foods, cosmetics, and other manufacturing as a fragrance or flavoring agent.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for RASPBERRY KETONE are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Hair loss (alopecia areata). Early research shows that applying a raspberry ketone solution to the scalp might increase hair growth in people with hair loss.
Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia). Early research shows that applying a raspberry ketone solution to the scalp might increase hair growth in people with male pattern baldness 
Obesity. Early research suggests that taking raspberry ketone plus vitamin C might decrease weight and body fat in healthy people. Other research suggests that taking a specific product (Prograde Metabolism, Ultimate Wellness Systems) containing raspberry ketone (Razberi K, Integrity Nutraceuticals) and other ingredients twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight, fat mass, waist and hip circumference when used with dieting compared to dieting alone in overweight people. The effects of taking raspberry ketone alone are not clear.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate raspberry ketone for these uses. 
"," Raspberry ketone is a chemical from red raspberries that is thought to help for weight loss. Some research in animals or in test tubes shows that raspberry ketone might increase some measures of metabolism. It might also affect a hormone in the body called adiponectin. Adiponectin can increase the rate at which the body burns fat and reduce appetite. However, it is important to keep in mind that there is no reliable scientific evidence that raspberry ketone improves weight loss when taken by people.","There isn't enough reliable information available to know if taking raspberry ketone alone is safe. There are some concerns about the safety of raspberry ketone because it is chemically related to a stimulant called synephrine. Therefore, it is possible that raspberry ketone might cause feelings of jitteriness, increase blood pressure, or rapid heartbeat. In one report, someone who took raspberry ketone described feelings of being shaky and a pounding heart beat (palpitations).


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking raspberry ketone if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Diabetes: Raspberry ketone might lower blood sugar levels.

Reishi mushroom is a fungus. Some people describe it as ""tough"" and ""woody"" with a bitter taste. The above-ground part and portions of the below-ground parts are used as medicine.

Reishi mushroom is used for cancer, aging, boosting the immune system to prevent or treat infections, and for many other reasons, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

In combination with other herbs, reishi mushroom is used to treat prostate cancer. Also in combination with other ingredients, reishi mushroom may be used for viruses, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), genital herpes, and cold sores.

High cholesterol. Reishi mushroom does not seem to lower cholesterol in people with diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Alzheimer's disease. Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom powder does not improve memory or quality of life in people with Alzheimer's disease.  
Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia; BPH). Men with enlarged prostates often have urinary symptoms. Taking reishi mushroom extract can improve some urinary symptoms such as the need to urinate often or immediately. But other symptoms such as urine flow rate don't seem to improve. Also it's not clear if reishi mushroom improves urinary symptoms in men with enlarged prostates. It might only improve urinary symptoms caused by other conditions. 
Cancer-related tiredness. Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom powder reduces tiredness in people with breast cancer.
Noncancerous tumors in the colon and rectum (colorectal adenomas). Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom extract can reduce the number and size of these tumors.
Clogged arteries. Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom extract (Ganopoly) reduces chest pain and shortness of breath in people with clogged arteries.
Diabetes. Most research shows that taking reishi mushroom extract doesn't improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. But most of these studies were small, and some conflicting results exist.
Genital herpes. Early research shows that taking a mixture of reishi mushroom and other ingredients helps reduces the time needed for herpes outbreaks to heal. 
Hepatitis B. Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom (Ganopoly) reduces how much of the hepatitis B virus is in the body. This product also seems to improve liver function in people with this condition.
Cold sores. Early research shows that taking a mixture of reishi mushroom and other ingredients reduces the time needed for cold sores to heal.
HPV (Human papilloma virus). Early research shows that taking a combination of reishi mushroom and coriolus mushroom reduces amounts of HPV virus in the mouth.
High blood pressure. The effect of reishi mushroom on blood pressure is conflicting. Taking reishi mushroom doesn't seem to lower blood pressure in people with only slightly high blood pressure. But it seems to lower blood pressure in people with more severe high blood pressure. 
Lung cancer. Early research shows that taking reishi mushroom does not shrink lung tumors. but it seems to improve immune function and quality of life in people with lung cancer.
Shingles-related pain. Some people report that hot water extracts of reishi mushroom decreases pain when conventional treatment does not work.
Altitude sickness.
Asthma and bronchitis.
Boosting the immune system.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
Fatigue.
HIV disease.
Kidney disorders.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of reishi mushroom for these uses.","Reishi mushroom contains chemicals that seem to have a variety of potentially beneficial effects, including activity against tumors (cancer) and beneficial effects on the immune system.","Reishi mushroom extract is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately for up to one year.

Reishi mushroom is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in a powdered form for more than one month. Use of powdered reishi mushroom has been associated with toxic effects on the liver. 

Reishi mushroom can also cause other side effects including dryness of the mouth, throat, and nasal area along with itchiness and rash, stomach upset and diarrhea, dizziness and headache, nosebleed, and bloody stools. Drinking reishi wine can cause a rash. Breathing in reishi spores can trigger allergies.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking reishi mushroom if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Bleeding disorder: High doses of reishi mushroom might increase the risk of bleeding in some people with certain bleeding disorders.
Low blood pressure: Reishi mushroom might lower blood pressure. There is a concern that it might make low blood pressure worse. If your blood pressure is too low, it is best to avoid reishi mushroom.
A clotting disorder called thrombocytopenia: High doses of reishi mushroom might increase the risk of bleeding in people with thrombocytopenia. If you have this condition, do not use reishi mushroom.
Surgery: High doses of reishi mushroom might increase the risk of bleeding in some people if used before or during surgery. Stop using reishi mushroom at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Resveratrol is a chemical found in red wine, red grape skins, purple grape juice, mulberries, and in smaller amounts in peanuts. It is used as a medicine.


Resveratrol is most commonly used for high cholesterol, cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions. However, there is not strong evidence to support the use of resveratrol for these uses.

","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for RESVERATROL are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Hay fever. Using a nasal spray containing resveratrol three times daily for 4 weeks seems to reduce allergy symptoms in adults with seasonal allergies. Using a nasal spray containing resveratrol and beta-glucans three times daily for 2 months also seems to reduce allergy symptoms in children with seasonal allergies.  

Possibly ineffective for...
Heart disease. People who consume higher amounts of dietary resveratrol do not seem to have a lower risk of heart disease compared to people who consume lower amounts. Also, taking resveratrol by mouth does not seem to improve levels of cholesterol or blood fats called triglycerides in people at risk for heart disease.  
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Most early research shows that resveratrol does not improve liver function, liver scarring, cholesterol levels, or weight in people with NAFLD. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Acne. Early research shows that applying a gel containing resveratrol to the face for 60 days reduces the severity of acne.
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Early research shows that taking trans-resveratrol does not improve hemoglobin levels or the need for blood transfusions in people with beta-thalassemia.
Cancer. People who consume higher amounts of dietary resveratrol do not seem to have a lower risk of cancer compared to people who consume lower amounts.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). It is unclear if resveratrol helps with memory or thinking skills. Resveratrol might improve mental function and memory in women after menopause. However, other research shows that resveratrol given in higher doses or for a longer time does not improve memory or thinking skills in healthy older adults.  Additionally, it doesn't seem to improve mental function in young adults.
Diabetes. Some research shows that resveratrol improves blood sugar control in people with diabetes. But other research shows no benefit. Resveratrol might help lower blood sugar in only patients with blood sugar levels that are not well controlled. More research is needed to confirm.
A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). . Early research suggests that taking a combination product containing resveratrol, vitamin C, zinc, and flavonoids slightly reduces coughing and mucus production in people with COPD. But it's not clear if the benefit is due to resveratrol or other ingredients.
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Early research shows that taking resveratrol helps to reduce body fat in people with metabolic syndrome. However, it doesn't help to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, or cholesterol. 
Osteoarthritis. Early research shows that adding resveratrol to standard treatments for knee osteoarthritis might improve pain, function, and stiffness more than standard treatments alone. 
Improving a medical procedure called peritoneal dialysis. Early research shows that resveratrol might make blood filtering go faster in people undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Early research shows that resveratrol decreases testosterone in women with PCOS. But it doesn't improve weight, lipid levels, acne, or unwanted hair growth in women with this condition.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Taking resveratrol along with drugs for RA seems to reduce the number of painful and swollen joints. But it's not known if resveratrol also helps reduce joint damage.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). Early research shows resveratrol might improve symptoms and reduce the activity of ulcerative colitis.
Aging skin.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).
Other conditions.




More evidence is needed to rate resveratrol for these uses.
",Resveratrol might expand blood vessels and reduce the activity of cells important in blood clotting. Some research suggests that resveratrol has weak estrogen (a female hormone) effects. It may also decrease pain and swelling (inflammation). Resveratrol might reduce levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood and help the body fight against disease. It might also prevent proteins in the brain from sticking together to help prevent diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.,"When taken by mouth: Resveratrol is LIKELY SAFE
when used in the amounts found in foods. When taken in doses up to 1500 mg daily for up to 3 months, resveratrol is POSSIBLY SAFE. Higher doses of up to 2000-3000 mg daily have been used safely for 2-6 months. However, these higher doses of resveratrol are more likely to cause stomach problems. 
When applied to the skin: Resveratrol is POSSIBLY SAFE
when applied to the skin for up to 30 days.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Resveratrol is LIKELY SAFE when used in amounts found in some foods. However, during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the source of resveratrol is important. Resveratrol is found in grape skins, grape juice, wine, and other food sources. Wine should not be used as a source of resveratrol during pregnancy and breast-feeding.
Children: Resveratrol is POSSIBLY SAFE in children when sprayed in the nostrils for up to 2 months.
Bleeding disorders: Resveratrol might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Resveratrol might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use resveratrol.
Surgery: Resveratrol might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using resveratrol at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.

Riboflavin is a B vitamin. It is involved in many processes in the body and is necessary for normal cell growth and function.  It can be found in certain foods such as milk, meat, eggs, nuts, enriched flour, and green vegetables. Riboflavin is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex products.

Some people take riboflavin by mouth to prevent low levels of riboflavin (riboflavin deficiency) in the body, for various types of cancer, and for migraine headaches. It is also taken by mouth for acne, muscle cramps, burning feet syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and blood disorders such as congenital methemoglobinemia and red blood cell aplasia. Some people use riboflavin for eye conditions including eye fatigue, cataracts, and glaucoma.

Some people also take riboflavin by mouth to maintain healthy hair, skin, and nails, to slow aging, for canker sores, multiple sclerosis, memory loss including Alzheimer's disease, high blood pressure, burns, liver disease, and sickle cell anemia.  ","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for RIBOFLAVIN are as follows:Effective for...
Preventing and treating low riboflavin levels (riboflavin deficiency). In adults and children who have too little riboflavin in their body, taking riboflavin by mouth can increase levels of riboflavin in the body. 

Possibly effective for...Cataracts.People who eat more riboflavin as part of their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing cataracts. Also, taking supplements containing riboflavin plus niacin seems to help prevent cataracts.
High amounts of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). Taking riboflavin by mouth for 12 weeks decreases levels of homocysteine by up to 40% in some people. Also, taking riboflavin along with folic acid and pyridoxine seems to lower homocysteine levels by 26% in people with high homocysteine levels caused by drugs that are used to prevent seizures.
Migraine headaches. Taking high-dose riboflavin by mouth seems to reduce the number of migraine headache attacks, by about 2 attacks per month. Taking riboflavin in combination with other vitamin sand minerals seems to also reduce the amount of pain experienced during a migraine.
 Possibly ineffective for...
Stomach cancer. Taking riboflavin along with niacin does help prevent gastric cancer.
Malnutrition caused by too little protein in the diet (kwashiorkor). Some research suggests that taking riboflavin, vitamin E, selenium, and N-acetyl cysteine by mouth does not reduce fluid, increase height or weight, or decrease infections in children at risk for kwashiorkor.
Lung cancer. Taking riboflavin by mouth along with niacin does not help prevent lung cancer. 
Malaria. Taking riboflavin along with iron, thiamine, and vitamin C by mouth, does not reduce the number or seriousness of malaria infections in children at risk of being exposed to malaria.
High blood pressure during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). In women that are 4 months pregnant, starting to take riboflavin by mouth does reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia during pregnancy.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Lactic acidosis (a serious blood-acid imbalance) in people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Early research shows that taking riboflavin by mouth might by helpful for treating lactic acidosis caused by drugs called nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Cervical cancer. Increasing intake of riboflavin from dietary and supplement sources, along with thiamine, folic acid, and vitamin B12, might decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer.
Cancer of the food pipe (esophageal cancer). Research on the effects of riboflavin for preventing esophageal cancer is conflicting. Some research shows that taking riboflavin by mouth may decrease the risk of getting esophageal cancer, while other research shows that it has no effect. 
High blood pressure. Early research shows that taking riboflavin by mouth in certain patients at higher risk of high blood pressure due to genetic differences may lower blood pressure when used in addition to prescribed blood pressure medications.
Liver cancer. Early research shows that taking riboflavin and niacin by mouth might reduce the risk of liver cancer in people less than 55 years-old. However, it does not seem to reduce the risk of liver cancer in older people.
Multiple sclerosis. Early research shows that taking riboflavin by mouth for 6 months does not improve disability in patients with multiple sclerosis.
White patches inside the mouth (oral leukoplakia). Early research shows that low levels of riboflavin in the blood are linked with an increased risk of oral leukoplakia. However, taking riboflavin supplements by mouth for 20 months does not seem to prevent or treat oral leukoplakia.
Iron deficiency during pregnancy. Early research shows that taking riboflavin, iron, and folic acid by mouth does not increase iron levels in pregnant women more than taking just iron and folic acid. 
Sickle cell disease. Early research shows that taking riboflavin by mouth for 8 weeks increases iron levels in people with low iron levels due to sickle cell disease. 
Stroke. Early research shows that taking riboflavin and niacin by mouth does not prevent stroke-related death in people at risk for stroke.
Acne.
Aging.
Boosting the immune system.
Canker sores.
Maintaining healthy skin and hair.
Memory loss including Alzheimer's disease.
Muscle cramps.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of riboflavin for these uses.","Riboflavin is required for the proper development of many things in the body including the skin, lining of the digestive tract, blood cells, and brain function.","Riboflavin is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth. In some people, riboflavin can cause the urine to turn a yellow-orange color. It may also cause diarrhea.
Special precautions & warnings:
Children: Riboflavin is LIKELY SAFE for most children when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts as recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board for the National Institute of Medicine (see dosing section below).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Riboflavin is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth and used appropriately for pregnant or breast-feeding women. The recommended amounts are 1.4 mg per day for pregnant women and 1.6 mg per day in breast-feeding women. Riboflavin is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in larger doses, short-term. Some research shows that riboflavin is safe when taken at a dose of 15 mg once every 2 weeks for 10 weeks.

Roman chamomile is a plant. The flowerheads are used to make medicine.

Some people take Roman chamomile by mouth for various digestive disorders including upset stomach (indigestion), nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and intestinal gas (flatulence). It is also commonly applied to the skin for pain and swelling (inflammation) and included as a germ-killer in ointments, creams, and gels used to treat cracked nipples, sore gums, and irritation of the skin. Some people put Roman chamomile in a steam bath and inhale it for sinus inflammation, hay fever, and sore throat. But there is limited scientific evidence to support any of these uses.

In foods and beverages, the essential oil and extract are used for flavoring.  

In manufacturing, the volatile oil of Roman chamomile is used as a fragrance in soaps, cosmetics, and perfumes; and to flavor cigarette tobacco. The extract is also used in cosmetics and soaps. Teas have been used as a hair tint and conditioner, and to treat parasitic worm infections.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ROMAN CHAMOMILE are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Indigestion.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Painful periods.
Sore throat.
Sinusitis.
Eczema.
Wounds.
Sore nipples and gums.
Liver and gallbladder problems.
Frostbite.
Diaper rash.
Hemorrhoids.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of Roman chamomile for these uses.",Roman chamomile contains chemicals that may help to fight cancer and diabetes. But more information is needed. ,"Roman chamomile is LIKELY SAFE for most people when used in amounts normally found in foods. It is POSSIBLY SAFE when used in large amounts and, in some people, may cause vomiting. 

The essential oil of Roman chamomile is POSSIBLY SAFE when inhaled or applied to the skin. In some people, when it is applied directly to the skin, it can make the skin red and itchy.

Rose hip is the round portion of the rose flower just below the petals. Rose hip contains the seeds of the rose plant. Dried rose hip and the seeds are used together to make medicine.

Fresh rose hip contains a lot of vitamin C, so it shares many uses with vitamin C including preventing and treating colds, flu, and vitamin C deficiencies. However, much of the vitamin C in rose hip is destroyed during drying and processing and also declines rapidly during storage. Because of this, many rose hip-derived ""natural"" vitamin C products have actually been fortified with lab-made vitamin C, but their labels may not always say so.

Orally, rose hip is also used for stomach disorders including stomach spasms, stomach acid deficiency, preventing stomach irritation and ulcers, and as a ""stomach tonic"" for intestinal diseases. Rose hip is also used for diarrhea, constipation, gallstones, gallbladder ailments, lower urinary tract and kidney disorders, fluid retention (dropsy or edema), gout, back and leg pain (sciatica), diabetes, high cholesterol, weight loss, high blood pressure, chest ailments, fever, increasing immune function during exhaustion, increasing blood flow in the limbs, increasing urine flow and quenching thirst.

Topically, rose hip is used for stretch marks.

In foods and in manufacturing, rose hip is used for tea, jam, soup, and as a natural source of vitamin C.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ROSE HIP are as follows:Possibly effective for...Osteoarthritis. Most research shows that taking a specific rose hip product (LitoZin/i-flex, Hyben Vital) by mouth twice daily for 3-4 months reduces pain and stiffness and improves function in people with osteoarthritis. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Obesity. Early research shows that taking rose hip powder mixed with apple juice does not affect weight or blood sugar levels in people who are obese. But it might slightly reduce cholesterol and blood pressure.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research shows that taking a specific rose hip product (LitoZin/i-flex, Hyben Vital) by mouth improves some symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Stretch marks (striae gravidarum). Early research shows that applying a specific cream containing rose hip oil and other ingredients (Velastisa Antiestrías, ISDIN) to the skin at least twice daily during pregnancy reduces the severity of stretch marks. It also might reduce the chance of getting stretch marks in women who didn't have stretch marks before becoming pregnant.
Boosting the immune system.
Diarrhea.
Fever.
Infections.
Preventing and treating colds.
Stomach irritations.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate rose hip for these uses.","Some people use rose hip as a source of vitamin C. It is true that fresh rose hip contains vitamin C. But processing and drying of the plant destroys most of the vitamin C. Besides vitamin C, other natural chemicals found in rose hip may be helpful for a variety of health conditions.","Rose hip is LIKELY SAFE for adults when taken by mouth appropriately. Rose hip can cause some side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, stomach cramps, fatigue, headache, inability to sleep, and others.

There is not enough reliable information about the safety of applying rose hip to the skin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking rose hip by mouth as a medicine during pregnancy or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid using amounts larger than those found in food. There is also not enough reliable information about the safety of rose hip when applied to the skin during pregnancy or breast feeding.
Diabetes: The vitamin C in rose hip might affect the control of diabetes, but not all experts agree on this.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency): Large amounts of the vitamin C in rose hip might increase the risk of complications.
Kidney stones: Large amounts of the vitamin C in rose hip might increase the chance of getting kidney stones.
Iron-related disorders such as hemochromatosis, thalassemia, or anemia: Use rose hip with caution if you have any of these conditions. The vitamin C in rose hip can increase iron absorption, which could make your condition worse.
Heart attack (myocardial infarction): Rose hip contains rugosin E. Rugosin E might cause blood clots. If you've had a heart attack, taking rose hip might increase the chance of blood clots or another heart attack.
Sickle cell disease: It is rare, but the vitamin C in rose hip might make blood more acidic. This could bring on a sickle cell crisis. It's best to avoid use.
Stroke: Rose hip contains rugosin E. Rugosin E might cause blood clots. If you've had a stroke, taking rose hip might increase the chance of blood clots or another stroke.
Blood clots in legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism): Rose hip contains rugosin E. Rugosin E might cause blood clots. If you've had blood clots in your legs or lungs before, taking rose hip might increase the chance of another clot.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/839.html,"García Hernández JÁ, Madera González D, Padilla Castillo M, Figueras Falcón T.

Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast. It was previously identified as a unique species of yeast. Now it is believed to be a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. But Saccharomyces boulardii is different from other strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae commonly known as brewer’s yeast and baker’s yeast. Saccharomyces boulardii is used as medicine.

Saccharomyces boulardii is most commonly used for treating and preventing diarrhea, including infectious types such as rotaviral diarrhea in children, diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal (GI) take-over (overgrowth) by ""bad"" bacteria in adults, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with tube feedings. It is also used to prevent and treat diarrhea caused by the use of antibiotics.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for SACCHAROMYCES BOULARDII are as follows:Likely effective for...
Diarrhea. Research shows that Saccharomyces boulardii can prevent diarrhea in people with feeding tubes. It also helps decrease how long diarrhea lasts in infants and children by about 12 hours to 1 day. However, Saccharomyces boulardii seems to be less effective than conventional medicines for diarrhea, such as loperamide (Imodium). 
Rotaviral diarrhea. Research shows that giving Saccharomyces boulardii to infants and children can shorten the duration of diarrhea caused by rotavirus by about 1 day.Possibly effective for...Acne. Research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth helps improve the appearance of acne.
Diarrhea in people taking antibiotics. Most research shows that Saccharomyces boulardii can help prevent diarrhea in adults and children being treated with antibiotics. For every 9-13 patients treated with Saccharomyces boulardii during treatment with antibiotics, one less person will develop antibiotic-related diarrhea.
Diarrhea caused by the bacteria Clostridium difficile. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii along with antibiotics seems to help prevent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea from re-occurring in people with a history of recurrence. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii along with antibiotics also seems to help prevent first episodes of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. But experts don't recommend using Saccharomyces for preventing first episodes.
Helicobacter pylori. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth along with standard H. pylori treatment helps treat this infection. About 12 people need to be treated with Saccharomyces boulardii for one patient who would otherwise remain infected to be cured. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii also helps prevent side effects such as diarrhea and nausea that occur with standard H. pylori treatment.
Diarrhea related to HIV. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth appears to reduce diarrhea related to HIV.
Traveler's diarrhea. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth appears to prevent traveler's diarrhea.

Possibly ineffective for...
Damage to the intestinal tract in preterm infants (Necrotizing enterocolitis; NEC). Research shows that giving Saccharomyces boulardii to preterm infants does not prevent NEC or death from any cause.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Amoeba infections (amebiasis). Early research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth along with antibiotics reduces diarrhea and stomach pain in people with amoeba infections.
Cholera. Saccharomyces boulardii does not seem to improve cholera symptoms, even when given with standard treatments. 
Crohn's disease. Taking Saccharomyces boulardii seems to reduce the number of bowel movements in people with Crohn's disease. Early research also shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii along with mesalamine can help people with Crohn's disease stay in remission longer. But taking Saccharomyces boulardii alone does not seem to help people with Crohn's disease stay in remission longer.
Cystic fibrosis. Early research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii by mouth does not reduce yeast infections in the digestive tract of people with cystic fibrosis.
Heart failure. Early research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii might improve heart function in people with heart failure. 
High cholesterol levels. Early research shows that Saccharomyces boulardii does not seem to affect cholesterol levels.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Research shows that taking Saccharomyces boulardii improves quality of life in people with diarrhea-predominant or mixed-type IBS. But Saccharomyces boulardii doesn't seem to improve most IBS symptoms such as stomach pain, urgency, or bloating.
Jaundice in infants. Some infants develop jaundice after birth due to high bilirubin levels. Giving Saccharomyces boulardii to term infants might prevent jaundice and reduce the need for phototherapy in a small number of these infants. But it's not known if Saccharomyces boulardii reduces the risk of jaundice in at-risk infants. Giving Saccharomyces boulardii to infants along with phototherapy doesn't lower bilirubin levels better than phototherapy alone.
Low birth weight. Giving a Saccharomyces boulardii supplement after birth seems to improve weight gain and feeding in preterm infants with low birth weight.
Ulcerative colitis. Early research shows that adding Saccharomyces boulardii to standard mesalamine therapy can reduce symptoms in people with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.
Canker sores.
Fever blisters.
High cholesterol.
Hives.
Lactose intolerance.
Lyme disease.
Urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Yeast infections.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate Saccharomyces boulardii for these uses.
","Saccharomyces boulardii is called a ""probiotic,"" a friendly organism that helps to fight off disease-causing organisms in the gut such as bacteria and yeast.","Saccharomyces boulardii is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth for up to 15 months. It can cause gas in some people. Rarely, it might cause fungal infections that can spread through the bloodstream to the entire body (fungemia).
Special precautions & warnings:
Children. Saccharomyces boulardii is POSSIBLY SAFE for children when taken by mouth appropriately. However, diarrhea in children should be evaluated by a healthcare professional before using Saccharomyces boulardii. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking Saccharomyces boulardii if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Elderly: The elderly might have an increased risk of fungal infection when taking Saccharomyces boulardii. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. 
Weakened immune system: There is some concern that taking Saccharomyces boulardii might cause fungemia, which is the presence of yeast in the blood. The actual number of cases of Saccharomyces boulardii-related fungemia is hard to determine. However, the risk seems to be greatest for people who are very sick or who have weakened immune systems. In particular, people with catheters, those receiving tube feeding, and those being treated with multiple antibiotics or antibiotics that work on a wide variety of infections seem to be most at-risk. In many cases, fungemia resulted from catheter contamination by air, environmental surfaces, or hands that have been contaminated with Saccharomyces boulardii. 
Yeast allergy: People with yeast allergy can be allergic to products containing Saccharomyces boulardii, and are best advised to avoid these products.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/332.html,"McDonald LC, Gerding DN, Johnson S, et al.; Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Senna is an herb. The leaves and the fruit of the plant are used to make medicine.
Senna is an FDA-approved over-the-counter (OTC) laxative. A prescription is not required to purchase senna. It is used to treat constipation and also to clear the bowel before diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy.
Senna is also used for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), anal or rectal surgery, tears in the lining of the anus (anal fissures), hemorrhoids, and weight loss.
Senna fruit seems to be gentler than senna leaf. This has led the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) to warn against long-term use of senna leaf, but not senna fruit. The AHPA recommends that senna leaf products be labeled, ""Do not use this product if you have abdominal pain or diarrhea. Consult a healthcare provider prior to use if you are pregnant or nursing. Discontinue use in the event of diarrhea or watery stools. Do not exceed recommended dose. Not for long-term use.""","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for SENNA are as follows:Likely effective for...Constipation. Taking senna by mouth is effective for short-term treatment of constipation. Senna is an FDA-approved nonprescription drug for adults and children ages 2 years and older. However, in children ages 3-15 years, mineral oil and a medication called lactulose might be more effective than taking senna. Senna also appears to be effective for treating constipation when used in combination with psyllium or docusate sodium. In elderly people, senna plus psyllium is more effective than lactulose for treating ongoing constipation. Senna plus docusate sodium is effective for treating constipation in the elderly and in people who have undergone anorectal surgery. Taking senna appears to be as effective as lactulose, psyllium, and docusate for relieving constipation in people taking opioids or loperamide. Possibly effective for...Bowel preparation before colonoscopy. Taking senna by mouth is as effective as castor oil and bisocodyl for bowel preparation. Some evidence suggests that senna is also at least as effective as polyethylene glycol for bowel preparation. However, conflicting evidence exists. It is unclear if taking senna with polyethylene glycol is more effective than taking polyethylene glycol alone. Senna appears to be less effective than sodium phosphate for bowel cleansing. However, taking a combination of senna, sodium picosulfate, and polyethylene glycol appears to be more effective than sodium phosphate for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. Using a combination of senna, mannitol, saline solution, and simethicone, before imaging of the bowel with a special capsule that is swallowed, seems to be more effective than using the same regimen without the senna.Possibly ineffective for...Diagnostic imaging. Taking senna by mouth does not appear to improve imaging of abdominal organs.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Hemorrhoids.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Losing weight.
Surgery of anus or rectum.
Tears in lining of anus (anal fissures).
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of senna for these uses.","Senna contains many chemicals called sennosides. Sennosides irritate the lining of the bowel, which causes a laxative effect.","Senna is LIKELY SAFE for most adults and children over age 2 when taken by mouth, short-term. Senna is an FDA-approved nonprescription medicine. Senna can cause some side effects including stomach discomfort, cramps, and diarrhea.

Senna is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth long-term or in high doses. Don't use senna for more than two weeks. Longer use can cause the bowels to stop functioning normally and might cause dependence on laxatives. Long-term use can also change the amount or balance of some chemicals in the blood (electrolytes) that can cause heart function disorders, muscle weakness, liver damage, and other harmful effects.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Senna is POSSIBLY SAFE during pregnancy and breast-feeding when taken by mouth, short-term. It is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth long-term or in high doses. Long-term, frequent use, or use of high doses has been linked to serious side effects including laxative dependence and liver damage.

Although small amounts of senna cross into breast milk, it doesn't seem to be a problem for nursing babies. As long as the mother uses senna in recommended amounts, senna does not cause changes in the frequency or consistency of babies' stools.
Electrolyte disturbances, potassium deficiency: Overuse of senna can make these conditions worse.
Dehydration, diarrhea or loose stools: Senna should not be used in people with dehydration, diarrhea, or loose stools. It can make these conditions worse.
Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions: Senna should not be used by people with abdominal pain (either diagnosed or undiagnosed), intestinal blockage, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, appendicitis, stomach inflammation, anal prolapse, or hemorrhoids.
Heart disease: Senna can cause electrolyte disturbances and might make heart disease worse.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/652.html,"Cogley K, Echevarria A, Correa C, De la Torre-Mondragón L.

Shark cartilage (tough elastic tissue that provides support, much as bone does) used for medicine comes primarily from sharks caught in the Pacific Ocean. Several types of extracts are made from shark cartilage including squalamine lactate, AE-941, and U-995.

Shark cartilage is most famously used for cancer. Shark cartilage is also used for osteoarthritis, plaque psoriasis, age-related vision loss, wound healing, damage to the retina of the eye due to diabetes, and inflammation of the intestine (enteritis).

Some people apply shark cartilage directly to the skin for arthritis and psoriasis.

Some people apply shark cartilage into the rectum for cancer.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for SHARK CARTILAGE are as follows:Likely ineffective for...Cancer. Most research shows that taking shark cartilage by mouth does not benefit people with advanced, previously treated cancers of the breast, colon, lung, prostate, or brain. It also doesn't seem to benefit people with advanced, previously treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Shark cartilage has not been studied in people with less advanced cancer.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Cancerous tumor called Kaposi sarcoma. There are reports that applying shark cartilage to the skin might decrease tumors called Kaposi sarcoma. These tumors are more common in people with HIV.
Osteoarthritis. When applied to the skin, products containing shark cartilage in combination with other ingredients reportedly reduce arthritis symptoms. However, any symptom relief is most likely due the camphor ingredient and not the other ingredients. Additionally, there is no research showing that shark cartilage is absorbed through the skin.
Psoriasis. Early research in people with plaque psoriasis shows that a specific shark cartilage extract (AE-941) improves the appearance of plaques and decreases itching when taken by mouth or applied to the skin.
A type of kidney cancer called renal cell carcinoma. Taking a specific shark cartilage extract (AE-941) by mouth might increase survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
Age-related vision loss.
Wound healing.
Other conditions.
More evidence is needed to rate shark cartilage for these uses.",Shark cartilage might prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for cancer to grow. It might also prevent the growth of blood vessels to psoriasis lesions. This might help heal these wounds.,"Shark cartilage is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for up to 40 months or when applied to the skin for up to 8 weeks.

It can cause a bad taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, constipation, low blood pressure, dizziness, high blood sugar, high calcium levels, weakness, and fatigue. It might also cause liver dysfunction. Some products have an unpleasant odor and taste.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking shark cartilage if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
""Autoimmune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions: Shark cartilage might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using shark cartilage.
High calcium levels (hypercalcemia): Shark cartilage might increase calcium levels, so it should not be used by people whose calcium levels are already too high.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/909.html,"Merly L, Smith SL.

Siberian ginseng is a plant. People use the root of the plant to make medicine.

Siberian ginseng is often called an ""adaptogen."" This is a non-medical term used to describe substances that can supposedly strengthen the body and increase general resistance to daily stress.

In addition to being used as an adaptogen, Siberian ginseng is used for conditions of the heart and blood vessels such as high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), and rheumatic heart disease.

It is also used for kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, high cholesterol, improving loss of sensation in extremities (peripheral neuropathy), fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, reducing the effects of a hangover, flu, colds, chronic bronchitis, and tuberculosis. It is also used for treating the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.

Some people use Siberian ginseng to improve athletic performance and the ability to do work. They also use it to treat sleep problems (insomnia) and the symptoms of infections caused by herpes simplex type 2.
 
It is also used to boost the immune system, prevent colds, and increase appetite.

In manufacturing, Siberian ginseng is added to skin care products.

Don't confuse Siberian ginseng with other types of ginseng. Siberian ginseng is not the same herb as American or Panax ginseng. Be careful about which product you choose. American and Panax ginseng can be a lot more expensive. It is said that years ago, the Soviet Union wanted to provide its athletes with the advantages offered by ginseng but wanted a less expensive version. So, Siberian ginseng became popular, and this is why most studies on Siberian ginseng have been done in Russia.

You should know that the quality of Siberian ginseng products varies a lot. Siberian ginseng is often misidentified or contains ""adulterants,"" which are other ingredients that do not contribute to the benefit of the product, but take up space in the product. Silk vine is a common adulterant of Siberian ginseng.

Before taking Siberian ginseng, talk with your healthcare provider if you take any medications.  This herb interacts with many prescription drugs.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for SIBERIAN GINSENG are as follows:Possibly effective for...Bipolar disorder. Taking Siberian ginseng plus lithium by mouth for 6 weeks appears to induce a similar response rate and remission rate as taking lithium plus fluoxetine in people with bipolar disorder.
Relieving symptoms of the common cold, when used in combination with an herb called andrographis. Some clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product containing Siberian ginseng plus andrographis (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) by mouth improves symptoms of the common cold when started within 72 hours of symptom onset. Some symptoms can improve after 2 days of treatment. However, it generally takes 4-5 days of treatment for the maximum benefit. Some research suggests this combination of Siberian ginseng and andrographis relieves cold symptoms in children better than echinacea. Also taking a specific product containing Siberian ginseng, echinacea, and malabar nut (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) for 6 days appears to improve coughing and congestion better than taking the drug bromohexine. 
Diabetes. Taking Siberian ginseng extract appears to decrease blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes.
A viral infection called herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2). Taking a specific Siberian ginseng extract, standardized to contain a specific ginseng ingredient called eleutheroside 0.3% (Elagen), seems to reduce the number, severity, and duration of herpes simplex type 2 infections.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Improving athletic performance. Research on the effects of Siberian ginseng for improving athletic performance is conflicting. Some research shows that taking a specific Siberian ginseng product (Endurox) does not seem to improve breathing or heart rate recovery following treadmill, cycling, or stair-stepping exercises. Also, taking a Siberian ginseng liquid extract that contains chemicals called eleutheroside B and eleutheroside E does not appear to improve endurance or performance in trained distance runners. However, other research shows that taking powdered Siberian ginseng containing these two chemicals might improve breathing and endurance while cycling.
Chronic fatigue syndrome. Taking Siberian ginseng by mouth does not seem to reduce symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.
Mental performance. Early research suggests that Siberian ginseng might improve memory and feelings of well-being in middle-aged people. Also, taking a combination of rhodiola, schisandra, and Siberian ginseng (ADAPT-232) seems to improve attention and mental speed and accuracy in women experiencing mental stress.
An inherited disorder that causes swelling and fevers (Familial Mediterranean fever). Early research suggests that taking a combination of Siberian ginseng, andrographis, schisandra, and licorice (ImmunoGuard, Inspired Nutritionals) reduces the duration, number, and severity of attaches of familial Mediterranean fever in children.
Hangover. Early research suggests that taking Siberian ginseng extract might relieve some symptoms associated with a hangover.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that injecting Siberian ginseng intravenously (by IV) might help reduce some risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol and an abnormal heart rate.
High Cholesterol. Taking Siberian ginseng extract appears to decrease triglyceride and total cholesterol levels.
Flu. Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing Siberian ginseng plus andrographis (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) helps relieve symptoms faster and reduce the risk of flu complications better than taking the drug amantadine. 
Stress. Early research suggests taking Siberian ginseng root has no effect on stress levels when taken alone or with stress management training.
Stroke. Early research suggests that injecting Siberian ginseng intravenously (by IV) might help treat strokes caused by a blockage of blood vessels that supply blood to the brain.
Osteoarthritis. Taking a combination of Panax ginseng, Siberian ginseng, and rehmannia for 6 weeks seems to improve physical function in people with knee osteoarthritis. However, the combination does not seem to reduce pain or stiffness.
Osteoporosis. Early research suggests that adding rehmannia and Siberian ginseng to calcium plus vitamin D treatment for one year helps reduce the loss of bone density in the spine and thigh bone in postmenopausal women.
Pneumonia. Early research suggests that taking a combination of rhodiola, schisandra, and Siberian ginseng (Chisan) along with standard treatment for 10-15 days helps reduce the length of time that antibiotics are needed and may improve quality of life in people with pneumonia better than standard treatment alone.
Quality of life. Some research shows that Siberian ginseng significantly improves sociability and sense of well-being in people over 65 years of age after 4 weeks of treatment. But the effects seem to disappear after 8 weeks.

More evidence is needed to rate Siberian ginseng for these uses.","Siberian ginseng contains many chemicals that affect the brain, immune system, and certain hormones. It might also contain chemicals that have activity against some bacteria and viruses.","Siberian ginseng is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth, short-term. While side effects are rare, some people can have drowsiness, changes in heart rhythm, sadness, anxiety, muscle spasms, and other side effects. In high doses, increased blood pressure might occur.

Siberian ginseng is POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth, long-term, or when injected intravenously (by IV), short term. Siberian ginseng has been taken by mouth in combination with rehmannia, calcium, and vitamin D for up to one year. Siberian ginseng has been injected by IV for up to 2 weeks.
Special precautions & warnings:
Children: Siberian ginseng is POSSIBLY SAFE in teenagers (ages 12-17 years) when taken by mouth for up to 6 weeks. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of Siberian ginseng when taken by teenagers long-term. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking Siberian ginseng if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Bleeding disorders: Siberian ginseng contains chemicals that might slow blood clotting. In theory, Siberian ginseng might increase the risk of bleeding and bruising in people with bleeding disorders.
Heart conditions: Siberian ginseng can cause a pounding heart, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure.  People who have heart disorders (e.g., ""hardening of the arteries,"" rheumatic heart disease, or history of heart attack) should use Siberian ginseng only under a healthcare provider's supervision.
Diabetes: Siberian ginseng might increase or decrease blood sugar. In theory, Siberian ginseng might affect blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Monitor your blood sugar carefully if you take Siberian ginseng and have diabetes.
Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Siberian ginseng might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use Siberian ginseng.
High blood pressure: Siberian ginseng should not be used by people with blood pressure over 180/90. Siberian ginseng might make high blood pressure worse.
Mental conditions such as mania or schizophrenia: Siberian ginseng might make these conditions worse. Use with caution.

Slippery elm is a tree that is native to eastern Canada and the eastern and central United States. Its name refers to the slippery feeling of the inner bark when it is chewed or mixed with water. The inner bark (not the whole bark) is used as medicine.

People take slippery elm by mouth for coughs, sore throat, colic, diarrhea, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), bladder and urinary tract infections and inflammation, syphilis, herpes, and for expelling tapeworms. It is also used for protecting against stomach and duodenal ulcers, for colitis, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal inflammation, and too much stomach acid. Slippery elm is also taken by mouth to cause an abortion and for cancer.

Slippery elm is applied to the skin for wounds, burns, gout, rheumatism, cold sores, boils, abscesses, ulcers, toothaches, sore throat, and as a lubricant to ease labor.

In manufacturing, slippery elm is used in some baby foods and adult nutritionals, and in some oral lozenges used for soothing throat pain.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for SLIPPERY ELM are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Sore throat. Slippery elm seems to soothe sore throats. Commercial lozenges containing slippery elm are preferred to the native herb when used for this condition. The lozenges prolong the pain-killing effect.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Cancer. Early research suggests that a specific product containing burdock root, Indian rhubarb, sheep sorrel, and slippery elm bark (Essiac, Resperin Canada Limited) does not improve quality of life in breast cancer patients.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early research suggests that taking a specific product containing slippery elm bark, lactulose, oat bran, and licorice root can increase bowel movements and reduce stomach pain and bloating in people with IBS that is characterized by constipation. A different combination product containing slippery elm bark, bilberry, cinnamon, and agrimony can reduce stomach pain, bloating, and gas in people with IBS that is characterized by diarrhea. The effects of taking slippery elm bark alone are not clear.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of slippery elm for these uses.",Slippery elm contains chemicals that can help soothe sore throats. It can also cause mucous secretion which might be helpful for stomach and intestinal problems.,"Slippery elm is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth appropriately. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of slippery elm when applied to the skin. In some people, slippery elm can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation when applied to the skin.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Folklore says that slippery elm bark can cause a miscarriage when it is inserted into the cervix of a pregnant woman. Over the years, slippery elm got the reputation of being capable of causing an abortion even when taken by mouth. However, there's no reliable information to confirm this claim. Nevertheless, stay on the safe side and don't take slippery elm if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/978.html,"Zalapa JE, Brunet J, Guries RP.

Decline in memory and thinking skills that normally occurs with age. Early research shows that taking an extract of a special type of spearmint daily might help with thinking skills in older adults who have started to notice problems with thinking. 
Male-pattern hair growth in women (hirsutism). Early research shows that drinking spearmint tea twice daily for up to one month can decrease levels of male sex hormone (testosterone) and increase levels of female sex hormone (estradiol) and other hormones in women with male-pattern hair growth. But it doesn't seem to greatly reduce the amount or location of male-pattern hair growth in women with this condition.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Early research shows that using 30 drops of a product containing lemon balm, spearmint, and coriander after meals for 8 weeks reduces stomach pain in people with IBS when taken along with the drug loperamide or psyllium.
Osteoarthritis. Early research shows that drinking spearmint tea reduces pain and stiffness by a small amount in people with knee osteoarthritis.

Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a bushy shrub that is native to northeast Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina. It is now grown in other parts of the world, including Canada and part of Asia and Europe. It is probably best known as a source of natural sweeteners.

Some people take stevia by mouth for medical purposes such as lowering blood pressure, treating diabetes, heartburn, high uric acid levels in the blood, for weight loss, to stimulate the heart rate, and for water retention.

Extracts from the stevia leaves are available as sweeteners in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Russia, Israel, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina. In the US, stevia leaves and extract are not approved for use as a sweetener, but they can be used as a ""dietary supplement"" or in skin care products. In December 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status to rebaudioside A, one of the chemicals in stevia, to be used as a food additive sweetener.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for STEVIA are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Diabetes. Research on how stevia might affect blood sugar in people with diabetes is inconsistent. Some early research suggests that taking 1000 mg daily of stevia leaf extract containing 91% stevioside might reduce blood sugar levels after meals by 18% in people with type 2 diabetes. However, other research shows that taking 250 mg of stevioside three times daily does not decrease blood sugar levels or HbA1c (a measure over blood sugar levels over time) after three months of treatment.
High blood pressure. How stevia might affect blood pressure is unclear. Some research suggests that taking 750-1500 mg of stevioside, a chemical compound in stevia, daily reduces systolic blood pressure (the upper number in a blood pressure reading) by 10-14 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) by 6-14 mmHg. However, other research suggests that taking stevioside does not reduce blood pressure.
Heart problems.
Heartburn.
Weight loss.
Water retention.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of stevia for these uses.","Stevia is a plant that contains natural sweeteners that are used in foods. Researchers have also evaluated the effect of chemicals in stevia on blood pressure and blood sugar levels. However, research results have been mixed.","Stevia and chemicals contained in stevia, including stevioside and rebaudioside A, are LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth as a sweetener in foods. Rebaudioside A has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status in the U.S. for use as a sweetener for foods. Stevioside has been safely used in research in doses of up to 1500 mg daily for 2 years.

Some people who take stevia or stevioside can experience bloating or nausea. Other people have reported feelings of dizziness, muscle pain, and numbness.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking stevia if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Allergy to ragweed and related plants: Stevia is in the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. This family includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many other plants.   In theory, people who are sensitive to ragweed and related plants may also be sensitive to stevia.
Diabetes: Some developing research suggests that some of the chemicals contained in stevia might lower blood sugar levels and could interfere with blood sugar control. However, other research disagrees. If you have diabetes and take stevia or any of the sweeteners it contains, monitor your blood sugar closely and report your findings to your healthcare provider.
Low blood pressure: There is some evidence, though not conclusive, that some of the chemicals in stevia can lower blood pressure. There is a concern that these chemicals might cause blood pressure to drop too low in people who have low blood pressure. Get your healthcare provider's advice before taking stevia or the sweeteners it contains, if you have low blood pressure.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/682.html,"Lemus-Mondaca R, Vega-Galvez A, Zura-Bravo L, Ah-Hen K.

Thiamine is a vitamin, also called vitamin B1. Vitamin B1 is found in many foods including yeast, cereal grains, beans, nuts, and meat. It is often used in combination with other B vitamins, and found in many vitamin B complex products. Vitamin B complexes generally include vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin/niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and folic acid. However, some products do not contain all of these ingredients and some may include others, such as biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), choline bitartrate, and inositol.

People take thiamine for conditions related to low levels of thiamine (thiamine deficiency syndromes), including beriberi and inflammation of the nerves (neuritis) associated with pellagra or pregnancy.

Thiamine is also used for digestive problems including poor appetite, ulcerative colitis, and ongoing diarrhea.

Thiamine is also used for AIDS and boosting the immune system, diabetic pain, heart disease, alcoholism, aging, a type of brain damage called cerebellar syndrome, canker sores, vision problems such as cataracts and glaucoma, and motion sickness. Other uses include preventing cervical cancer and progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Some people use thiamine for maintaining a positive mental attitude; enhancing learning abilities; increasing energy; fighting stress; and preventing memory loss, including Alzheimer's disease.

Healthcare providers give thiamine shots for a memory disorder called Wernicke's encephalopathy syndrome, other thiamine deficiency syndromes in critically ill people, alcohol withdrawal, and coma.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for THIAMINE are as follows:Effective for...Metabolic disorders. Taking thiamine by mouth helps correct certain inherited metabolic disorders, including Leigh's disease, maple syrup urine disease, and others.
Thiamine deficiency. Taking thiamine by mouth helps prevent and treat thiamine deficiency.
Brain disorder due to thiamine deficiency (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). Thiamine helps decrease the risk and symptoms of a specific brain disorder called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). This brain disorder is related to low levels of thiamine. It is often seen in alcoholics. Giving thiamine shots seems to help decrease the risk of developing WKS and decrease symptoms of WKS during alcohol withdrawal.
Possibly effective for...Cataracts. High thiamine intake as part of the diet is associated with reduced odds of developing cataracts.
Kidney disease in people with diabetes. Early research shows that taking high-dose thiamine (300 mg daily) decreases the amount of albumin in the urine in people with type 2 diabetes. Albumin in the urine is an indication of kidney damage.
Painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea). Taking thiamine seems to reduce menstrual pain in teenage girls and young women. 
Possibly ineffective for...Repelling mosquitos. Some research shows that taking B vitamins, including thiamine, does not help to repel mosquitos. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Preventing cervical cancer. Increased intake of thiamine and other B vitamins is linked with a decreased risk of precancerous spots on the cervix.
Shingles (herpes zoster). Injecting thiamine under the skin seems to reduce itch but not pain in people with shingles. 
Prediabetes. Early research shows that taking thiamine by mouth helps decrease post-meal blood sugar levels in people with prediabetes. 
Aging.
AIDS.
Alcoholism.
Brain conditions.
Canker sores.
Chronic diarrhea.
Heart disease.
Poor appetite.

Ulcerative colitis.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate thiamine for these uses.",Thiamine is required by our bodies to properly use carbohydrates. It also helps maintain proper nerve function.,"Thiamine is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts, although rare allergic reactions and skin irritation have occurred. It is also LIKELY SAFEwhen given appropriately intravenously (by IV) or as a shot into the muscle by a healthcare provider. Thiamine shots are an FDA-approved prescription product.

Thiamine might not properly enter the body in some people who have liver problems, drink a lot of alcohol, or have other conditions.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Thiamine is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant or breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amount of 1.4 mg daily. Not enough is known about the safety of using larger amounts during pregnancy or breast-feeding.
Alcoholism and a liver disease called cirrhosis: Alcoholics and people with cirrhosis often have low levels of thiamine. Nerve pain in alcoholism can be worsened by thiamine deficiency. These people might require thiamine supplements.
Critical illness: People that are critically ill such as those that had surgery might have low levels of thiamine.  These people might require thiamine supplements.
Hemodialysis: People undergoing hemodialysis treatments might have low levels of thiamine. They might require thiamine supplements.
Syndromes in which it is difficult for the body to absorb nutrients (malabsorption syndromes): People with malabsorption syndromes may have low levels of thiamine. The might require thiamine supplements.

Vitamin B6 is a type of B vitamin. It can be found in certain foods such as cereals, beans, vegetables, liver, meat, and eggs. It can also be made in a laboratory.

Vitamin B6 is used for preventing and treating low levels of pyridoxine (pyridoxine deficiency) and the anemia that may result. It is also used for heart disease, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), depression, and many other conditions. 


Vitamin B6 is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex products.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for VITAMIN B6 are as follows:Effective for...
Seizures. Administering vitamin B6 intravenously (by IV) controls seizures in infants that are caused by vitamin B6 dependence.
A condition in which the body makes abnormal red blood cells that build up iron (sideroblastic anemia). Administering vitamin B6 as pyridoxine intravenously (by IV) controls seizures in infants that are caused by pyridoxine dependence.
Vitamin B6 deficiency. Taking vitamin B6 by mouth is effective for preventing and treating vitamin B6 deficiency.
Likely effective for...High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). Taking vitamin B6 by mouth, usually with folic acid, is effective for treating high homocysteine levels in the blood.
Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration). Some research shows that taking vitamin B6 with other vitamins including folic acid and vitamin B12 might help prevent the loss of vision caused by an eye disease called macular degeneration.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). As people age, their arteries tend to lose their ability to stretch and flex. Garlic and other ingredients seem to reduce this effect. Taking a specific supplement containing garlic, amino acids (part of proteins), and vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 (Kyolic, Total Heart Health, Formula 108, Wakunga) seem to reduce symptoms of hardening of the arteries.
Kidney stones. People with a hereditary disorder called type I primary hyperoxaluria have an increased risk of forming kidney stones. There is some evidence that taking vitamin B6 by mouth, alone or along with magnesium, or getting vitamin B6 injected into the vein, can decrease the risk of kidney stones in people with this condition. However, it does not appear to help people with other kinds of kidney stones.
Morning sickness. Some research suggests that taking vitamin B6, usually as pyridoxine, improves symptoms of mild to moderate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology considers vitamin B6 a first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by pregnancy. Vitamin B6 plus the medication doxylamine is recommended for women who do not get better when treated with just vitamin B6. However, taking this combination is less effective than the medication ondansetron.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). There is some evidence that taking vitamin B6 as pyridoxine by mouth can improve PMS symptoms including breast pain. The lowest effective dose should be used. Higher doses will increase the chance of side effects and are not likely to increase the beneficial effects.
A movement disorder often caused by antipsychotic drugs (tardive dyskinesia). Taking vitamin B6 seems to improve movement disorders in people taking certain drugs for schizophrenia.
Possibly ineffective for...
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. . One study shows that taking vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 might help prevent certain parts of the brain from deteriorating in elderly people. However, most research shows that taking vitamin B6 along with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not improve mental function in elderly people.
Alzheimer disease. Early research suggests that higher intake of vitamin B6 from supplements or as part of the diet is not associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease in older people.
Autism. Taking vitamin B6 along with magnesium does not seem to improve behavior in children with autism.
Carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 might relieve certain symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, most research suggests that this supplement does not benefit people with this condition.
Cataracts. Research shows that taking vitamin B6 in combination with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not prevent cataracts in women. And it might increase the risk of having the cataracts removed.
An adverse skin reaction caused by cancer drug treatment (chemotherapy-induced acral erythema). Hand-foot syndrome is a skin reaction caused by cancer drugs. Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to prevent this skin reaction in people treated with cancer drugs. There's also concern that vitamin B6 might reduce how well the cancer drugs work.
Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Research shows that taking a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 does not reduce the risk of colorectal polyps in women at high risk of heart disease.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Research shows that taking a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 does not prevent broken bones in people with weak bones (osteoporosis).
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Acne. Early research suggests that taking a product containing nicotinamide, azelaic acid, zinc, vitamin B6, copper, and folic acid, reduces lesion swelling and helps with the appearance of acne in adults and children.
A procedure to open a blocked or narrowed blood vessel (angioplasty). Evidence on the benefits of vitamin B6 for preventing the re-blockage of blood vessels after angioplasty is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 might reduce the re-blockage of blood vessels in people treated with balloon angioplasty. But other research shows no benefit in people who underwent coronary stenting.
Asthma. The effectiveness of vitamin B6 supplementation in children with asthma is unclear.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that taking vitamin B6 daily for 4 weeks does not reduce eczema symptoms in children.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early research shows that taking vitamin B6 by mouth, with or without high doses of other B vitamins, might help ADHD. However, research using high doses of both vitamin B6 and other vitamins seems to have no effect on ADHD symptoms. 
Cancer. Eating more foods that contain vitamin B6 has been linked with a lower risk of cancer. But taking vitamin B6 along with other vitamins and nutrients doesn't prevent cancer in people with heart disease or kidney damage.
Heart disease. Taking B vitamin combinations that include vitamin B6 does not seem to prevent death or heart attack in people with heart disease. But some recent data shows it might slightly lower the risk of stroke.
Cavities. Taking vitamin B6 may reduce the risk of dental cavities during pregnancy.
Depression. Eating more food that contains vitamin B6 has been linked with a lower risk of depression. Taking a vitamin B6 supplement doesn't seem to reduce depression symptoms in most people. But it might reduce the risk of developing depression in women taking birth control pills.
Diabetes. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 improves blood sugar levels in women who are pregnant and have low levels of vitamin B6. But not all research agrees.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). There is conflicting evidence about the role of vitamin B6 in people with diabetes-related nerve pain . Some research suggests that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with thiamine or folic acid and vitamin B12 improves some symptoms of nerve pain so that people feel happier. However, the nerves do not seem to function any better.
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily might reduce painful periods.
Seizures in women with pre-eclampsia (eclampsia). Taking vitamin B doesn't seem to reduce the risk of seizures during pregnancy.
High blood pressure. Early research suggests that taking pyridoxine can lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure.
High levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 does not reduce high levels of blood fats called triglycerides. However, it might slightly reduce cholesterol levels.
Insomnia. Some research shows that taking a product containing a protein called casein, plants called zizyphus and hops, as well as magnesium and vitamin B6, does not help people sleep better.
Nerve damage caused by a drug for tuberculosis (isoniazid-induced neuropathy). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily might reduce nerve damage caused by isoniazid, a medication taken for tuberculosis.
Breast-feeding. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily for about one week after giving birth does not stop breast milk production.
Lung cancer. People who have higher blood levels of vitamin B6 seem to have a lower risk of lung cancer. This seems to be especially true for men and for people with a history of smoking. It's unclear if taking vitamin B6 as a supplement can reduce the risk of lung cancer.
Nausea and vomiting. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 does not reduce nausea or vomiting or improve symptoms of dehydration in children with an infection in the stomach or intestines. However it might reduce the risk of nausea in women taking birth control pills.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.
Preterm birth. Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to reduce the risk of preterm birth.
Seizures not caused by epilepsy. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily for 12 months does not reduce the risk of seizures caused by a high fever in children.
Stroke. Taking B vitamin supplements that include vitamin B6 might slightly reduce stroke risk in people with heart disease. But it's unknown which combination of B vitamins has the most benefit. 
Nerve damage caused by the drug vincristine. One report suggests that vitamin B6 might help reverse nerve damage caused by the chemotherapy drug vincristine. Research is needed to confirm these results.
Allergies.
Down syndrome.
Kidney problems.
Long-term swelling (inflammation) in the digestive tract (inflammatory bowel disease or IBD).
Lyme disease.
Muscle cramps.
Night leg cramps.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate vitamin B6 for these uses.","Vitamin B6 is required for the proper function of sugars, fats, and proteins in the body. It is also required for the proper growth and development of the brain, nerves, skin, and many other parts of the body.","When taken by mouth: Vitamin B6 is LIKELY SAFE for most people when used appropriately. When taken in amounts greater than the recommended dietary allowance, vitamin B6 is POSSIBLY SAFE. In some people, vitamin B6 might cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, headache, tingling, sleepiness, and other side effects.

Vitamin B6 is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in large doses, long-term. When used in high doses it might cause brain and nerve problems.
When given by IV: Vitamin B6 is LIKELY SAFE when given by IV under medical supervision for uses approved by the FDA.
When given as a shot: Vitamin B6 is LIKELY SAFE when given as a shot into the muscle under medical supervision in amounts approved by the FDA. Using large doses of vitamin B6 as a shot into the muscle is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. It might cause muscle problems. 


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding:  Vitamin B6 is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant women when taken under the supervision of their healthcare provider. It is sometimes used in pregnancy to control morning sickness. High doses are UNSAFE. High doses can cause newborns to have seizures.

Vitamin B6 is LIKELY SAFE for breast-feeding women when used in amounts not larger than 2 mg per day (the recommended dietary allowance). Avoid using higher amounts. Not enough is known about the safety of vitamin B6 at higher doses in breast-feeding women.
Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty). Using vitamin B6 along with folic acid and vitamin B12 intravenously (by IV) or by mouth might worsen narrowed arteries. Vitamin B6 should not be used by people recovering from this procedure.
Weight loss surgery. Taking a vitamin B6 supplement is not needed for people that have had weight loss surgery. And taking too much vitamin B6 might increase the chance of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and browning skin. 
Diabetes. Using a combination of vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 might increase the risk of cancer in people with diabetes and a recent stroke. Vitamin B6 should not be used by patients with diabetes that have had a recent stroke.

Vitamin K is a vitamin found in leafy green vegetables, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts. The name vitamin K comes from the German word ""Koagulationsvitamin.""

Several forms of vitamin K are used around the world as medicine. Vitamin K1 (phytonadione) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone) are available in North America. Vitamin K1 is generally the preferred form of vitamin K because it is less toxic, works faster, is stronger, and works better for certain conditions.

Vitamin K is most commonly used for blood clotting problems. For example, vitamin K is used to reverse the effects of ""blood thinning"" medications when too much is given. It is also used to prevent clotting problems in newborns who don't have enough vitamin K. Vitamin K is also given to treat and prevent vitamin K deficiency, a condition in which the body doesn't have enough vitamin K.
 
An increased understanding of the role of vitamin K in the body beyond blood clotting led some researchers to suggest that the recommended amounts for dietary intake of vitamin K be increased. In 2001, the National Institute of Medicine Food and Nutrition Board increased their recommended amounts of vitamin K slightly, but refused to make larger increases. They explained there wasn't enough scientific evidence to make larger increases in the recommended amount of vitamin K.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for VITAMIN K are as follows:Effective for...Preventing bleeding problems in newborns with low levels of vitamin K (hemorrhagic disease). Giving vitamin K1 by mouth or as a shot into the muscle helps prevent bleeding problems in newborns. Shots seem to work the best.
Treating and preventing bleeding problems in people with low levels of the blood clotting protein prothrombin. Taking vitamin K1 by mouth or as an injection into the vein can prevent and treat bleeding problems in people with low levels of prothrombin due to using certain medications.
An inherited bleeding disorder called vitamin K-dependent clotting factors deficiency (VKCFD). Taking vitamin K by mouth or as an injection into the vein can help prevent bleeding in people with VKCFD.
Reversing the effects of too much warfarin used to prevent blood clotting. Taking vitamin K1 by mouth or as in injection into the vein can reverse too much blood clotting caused by warfarin. However, injecting vitamin K1 under the skin does not seem to work. Taking vitamin K along with warfarin also seems to help stabilize blood clotting time in people taking warfarin. It works best in people who have low vitamin K levels.Possibly effective for...
Weak bones (osteoporosis). Taking a specific form of vitamin K2 seems to improve bone strength and reduce the risk of fracture in most older women with weak bones. But it doesn't seem to benefit older women who still have strong bones. Taking vitamin K1 seems to increase bone strength and might prevent fractures in older women. But it might not work as well in older men. Vitamin K1 doesn't seem to improve bone strength in women who have not gone through menopause or in people with Crohn's disease. 

Possibly ineffective for...
Bleeding within the fluid-filled areas (ventricles) of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage). Giving vitamin K to women at risk for very preterm births does not seem to prevent bleeding in the brain of preterm infants. It also doesn't seem to reduce the risk of nerve injury caused by these bleeds.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Athletic performance. Early research suggests that taking vitamin K2 by mouth might improve exercise performance by increasing the work of the heart.
Blood disorder (beta-thalassemia). Early research shows that taking vitamin K2 by mouth along with calcium and vitamin D can improve bone mass in children with this blood disorder.
Breast cancer. Research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 is linked with a lower risk of developing breast cancer.
Cancer. Some research has linked a higher food intake of vitamin K2, but not vitamin K1, with a reduced risk of death from cancer. But other research has linked a higher food intake of vitamin K1, but not vitamin K2, with a reduced risk of death from cancer.
Cataracts. Some research has linked a higher food intake of vitamin K2 with a lower risk of getting cataracts.
Colorectal cancer. Early research suggests that a higher dietary intake of vitamin K is not linked with a reduced risk of cancer of the colon and rectum.
Heart disease. Higher dietary intake of vitamin K2 has been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, risk factors for heart disease, and death due to heart disease in older men and women. But vitamin K2 intake from food does not seem to be linked with a reduced risk a heart disease in people at high risk for this condition. Dietary intake of vitamin K1 has not been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease. But increasing vitamin K1 intake from food has been linked with a reduced risk of death due to heart disease. Also, taking vitamin K1 as a supplement seems to prevent or reduce the advancement of coronary calcification. This is a risk factor for heart disease.
Cystic fibrosis. People with cystic fibrosis can have low levels of vitamin K due to problems digesting fat. Taking a combination of vitamins A, D, E, and K seems to improve vitamin K levels in people with cystic fibrosis who have trouble digesting fat. Also, early research shows that taking vitamin K by mouth for can enhance the production of osteocalcin. Osteocalcin plays a role in the body's bone-building and metabolic regulation. But there is no reliable evidence suggesting that vitamin K improves overall health in people with cystic fibrosis.
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking a multivitamin fortified with vitamin K1 does not lower the risk of developing diabetes compared to taking a regular multivitamin.
Skin rash associated with a type of cancer medicine. People who are given a certain type of anticancer medicine often develop skin rash. Early research shows that applying a cream containing vitamin K1 helps prevent skin rash in people being given this type of medicine. 
High cholesterol. There is early evidence that vitamin K2 might lower cholesterol in people on dialysis with high cholesterol levels.
Liver cancer. Taking vitamin K2 does not seem to prevent liver cancer recurrence. But some early research shows that taking vitamin K2 reduces the risk of liver cancer in people with liver cirrhosis.
Lung cancer. Early research suggests that higher intake of vitamin K2 from food is linked with a reduced risk of lung cancer and lung cancer-related death. Dietary intake of vitamin K1 does not seem to be linked with a reduced risk of these events.
Multiple sclerosis (MS). Interferon is a medicine that helps people with MS. This medicine often causes a rash and burning of the skin. Early research shows that applying vitamin K cream modestly reduces rash and burning in people with treated with interferon.
Prostate cancer. Early research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin K2, but not vitamin K1, is linked with a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Early research shows that taking vitamin K2 along with arthritis medicine reduces markers of joint swelling better than taking arthritis medicine alone.
Stroke. Population research suggests that dietary intake of vitamin K1 is not linked with a reduced risk of stroke.

More evidence is needed to rate vitamin K for these uses.","Vitamin K is an essential vitamin that is needed by the body for blood clotting, bone building, and other important processes.","The two forms of vitamin K (vitamin K1 and vitamin K2) are LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth or injected into the vein appropriately. Most people do not experience any side effects when taking vitamin K in the recommended amount each day. However, some people may have an upset stomach or diarrhea.

Vitamin K1 is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when applied as a cream that contains 0.1% vitamin K1.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: When taken in the recommended amount each day, vitamin K is considered safe for pregnant and breast-feeding women. Don't use higher amounts without the advice of your healthcare professional.
Children: The form of vitamin K known as vitamin K1 is LIKELY SAFE for children when taken by mouth or injected into the body appropriately.
Diabetes: The form of vitamin K known as vitamin K1 might lower blood sugar levels. If you have diabetes and take vitamin K1, monitor your blood sugar levels closely.
Kidney disease: Too much vitamin K can be harmful if you are receiving dialysis treatments due to kidney disease.
Liver disease: Vitamin K is not effective for treating clotting problems caused by severe liver disease. In fact, high doses of vitamin K can make clotting problems worse in these people.
Reduced bile secretion: People with decreased bile secretion who are taking vitamin K might need to take supplemental bile salts along with vitamin K to ensure vitamin K absorption.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/983.html,"McFarlin BK, Henning AL, Venable AS.

Whey protein is the protein contained in whey, the watery portion of milk that separates from the curds when making cheese.

Whey protein is commonly used for improving athletic performance and increasing strength, but evidence to support these uses is mixed. Whey protein is also used to reverse weight loss in people with HIV and to help prevent allergic conditions in infants.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for WHEY PROTEIN are as follows:Possibly effective for...
Athletic performance. Most research shows that taking whey protein in combination with strength training increases lean body mass, strength, and muscle size in healthy young adults. Taking whey protein also appears to improve running speed and recovery from exercise in untrained adults. Whey protein seems to work as well as soy, chicken or beef protein for increasing muscle strength.
Eczema. Research shows that infants who consume whey protein by mouth during the first 3-12 months of life have a lower risk of developing red, itchy skin by the age of 3 years.
A condition associated with an increased risk for developing allergic reactions (atopic disease). Research shows that infants who consume whey protein by mouth during the first 3-12 months of life are less likely to be prone to allergies and allergic reactions compared to infants who receive standard formula. However, taking why protein might not be helpful for treating atopic diseases once they develop.
Weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Some research shows that taking whey protein by mouth can help decrease weight loss in people with HIV.
Red, scaly skin (plaque psoriasis). Some evidence shows that taking a specific whey protein extract daily for 8 weeks can reduce psoriasis symptoms.Possibly ineffective for...
A lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Some research shows that taking a specific whey protein supplement daily for 6 weeks can improve shortness of breath but not lung function or quality of life in people with COPD. Other research suggests that taking whey protein supplements does not improve lung function, muscle function, or exercise in people with COPD.
Osteoporosis. Research suggests that taking a drink containing whey protein daily for up to  2 years does not improve bone density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Muscle loss in the elderly. Adding whey protein to exercise seems to increase muscle in older people. However, it also works when it is taken with other compounds like creatine, fats, vitamins, or minerals.  
Asthma. Early research shows that taking a specific type of whey protein daily for 30 days does not improve lung function in children with asthma.
Cancer. There is some evidence that taking whey protein might help reduce tumor size in some people with cancer that has spread.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research shows that taking a small amount of whey protein does not improve memory or thinking skills in older adults. However, it might improve memory in older adults that are very tired. 
Cystic fibrosis. Early research suggests that taking whey protein daily for 28 days improves lung function in children, but not adults with cystic fibrosis.
Diabetes. Early research shows that consuming a specific drink containing whey protein concentrate immediately before a meal decreases blood sugar in people with diabetes. However, taking whey protein daily and exercising daily does not seem to lower blood sugar over a longer time period.  
Asthma caused by exercise. Early research suggests that taking whey protein daily for 10 days improves lung function in people with asthma caused by exercise.
Muscle damage caused by exercise. Whey protein might improve recovery from exercise and muscle damage from exercise. However, it does not seem to work for everyone. 
Liver disease (hepatitis). Early research suggests that taking a specific type of whey protein daily for 12 weeks can improve liver function in some people with hepatitis B. However, it does not appear to benefit people with hepatitis C.
HIV/AIDS. Early research suggests that taking whey protein for 4 months does not improve immune function in children with HIV.
Infections developed while in the hospital. Early research suggests that taking a specific whey protein supplement daily for up to 28 days has a similar effect on the rate of hospital-acquired infections as taking a combination of zinc, selenium, glutamine, and metoclopramide.
High cholesterol. Early research suggests that taking whey protein daily while participating in weight lifting exercises does not reduce cholesterol levels or body fat in overweight men with high cholesterol.
High blood pressure. Taking 28 grams of whey protein or 20 grams of hydrolyzed whey protein daily for 6-8 weeks can lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But taking low amounts of whey protein (2.6 grams daily) doesn't have any benefit.
Muscular disease (mitochondrial myopathies). Early research suggests that taking a whey protein supplement daily for one month does not improve muscle strength or quality of life in people with mitochondrial diseases.
Liver disease not due to alcohol use (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH). Early research suggests that taking whey protein daily for 12 weeks can improve liver function in patients with NASH.
Parkinson's disease. Some research shows that taking whey protein doesn't help Parkinson's disease symptoms. 
An ovary disorder known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Early research suggests that taking a supplement containing whey protein daily for 2 months can reduce body weight, fat mass, and cholesterol in people with ovarian cysts. However, whey protein does not improve blood sugar and seems to decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol.
Aching and stiffness caused by inflammation (polymyalgia rheumatica). Early research suggests that taking whey protein in a dairy product twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve muscle function, walking speed, or other movement tests in people with polymyalgia rheumatica.
Weight loss. The effects of whey protein on weight loss seem to vary depending on whether it is used alone or along with dieting or exercise. Taking whey protein along with dieting might prevent the loss of lean muscle and increase the loss of body fat in people who are obese or overweight. This might improve overall body composition. But taking whey protein while dieting doesn't seem to increase overall weight loss in most people who are obese or overweight. It's too soon to know if taking whey protein without dieting improves weight loss. When used along with exercise, whey protein doesn't seem to improve weight loss compared to exercise alone. In overweight teens, drinking a whey protein beverage for 12 weeks seems to increase weight and body mass index (BMI).
Other conditions.



More evidence is needed to rate whey protein for these uses.
",Whey protein is a source of protein that might improve the nutrient content of the diet. Whey protein might also have effects on the immune system.,"Whey protein is LIKELY SAFE for most children and adults when taken by mouth appropriately. High doses can cause some side effects such as increased bowel movements, nausea, thirst, bloating, cramps, reduced appetite, tiredness (fatigue), and headache.
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking whey protein if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Milk allergy: If you are allergic to cow's milk, avoid using whey protein.

Wild yam is a plant. It contains a chemical called diosgenin. This chemical can be made in the laboratory into various steroids, such as estrogen and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The root and the bulb of the plant are used as a source of diosgenin, which is prepared as an “extract,” a liquid that contains concentrated diosgenin.

There are over 600 species of wild yam. Some species are grown specifically as a source of diosgenin for laboratories to use in making steroids. These species are generally not eaten due to a bitter flavor. Only about 12 of the 600 species are considered edible.

Diosgenin or wild yam is often promoted as a “natural alterative” to estrogen therapy, so you will see it used for estrogen replacement therapy, vaginal dryness in older women, PMS (premenstrual syndrome), menstrual cramps, weak bones (osteoporosis), increasing energy and sexual drive in men and women, and breast enlargement. Wild yam does seem to have some estrogen-like activity, but it is not actually converted into estrogen in the body. It takes a laboratory to do that.

Similarly, you will also see wild yam and diosgenin promoted as a “natural DHEA.” This is because in the laboratory DHEA is made from diosgenin, but this chemical reaction is not believed to occur in the human body. So taking wild yam extract will not increase DHEA levels in people. Individuals who are interested in taking DHEA should avoid wild yam products labeled as ""natural DHEA.""

Wild yam is also used for treating a disorder of the intestines called diverticulosis, gallbladder pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and for increasing energy.

Some women apply wild yam creams to the skin to reduce menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for WILD YAM are as follows:Possibly ineffective for...Menopausal symptoms.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking wild yam if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Wild yam might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, do not use wild yam.
Protein S deficiency: People with protein S deficiency have an increased risk of forming clots. There is some concern that wild yam might increase the risk of clot formation in these people because it might act like estrogen. There is one case report of a patient with protein S deficiency and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed a clot in the vein serving the retina in her eye 3 days after taking a combination product containing wild yam, dong quai, red clover, and black cohosh. If you have protein S deficiency, it is best to avoid using wild yam until more is known.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/970.html,"Pengelly A, Bennett K.

Willow bark is the bark from several varieties of the willow tree, including white willow or European willow, black willow or pussy willow, crack willow, purple willow, and others. The bark is used to make medicine.

Willow bark acts a lot like aspirin, so it is used for pain, including headache, muscle or joint pain, menstrual cramps, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, gout, and a disease of the spine called ankylosing spondylitis.

Willow bark's pain relieving potential has been recognized throughout history. Willow bark was commonly used during the time of Hippocrates, when people were advised to chew on the bark to relieve pain and fever.

Willow bark is also used for the common cold, flu, and weight loss.

Salicin, the active ingredient in willow bark, seems to have contributed to the death of the composer, Ludwig von Beethoven. Apparently, Beethoven ingested large amounts of salicin before he died. His autopsy report is the first recorded case of a particular type of kidney damage that can be caused by salicin.","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for WILLOW BARK are as follows:Possibly effective for...Treating lower back pain. Willow bark seems to reduce lower back pain. Higher doses seem to be more effective than lower doses. It can take up to a week for significant improvement in symptoms.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...Joint pain. Research shows that taking a specific product containing glucosamine sulfate, methylsufonlylmethane, white willow bark extract, ginger root concentrate, boswellia extract, turmeric root extract, cayenne, and hyaluronic acid (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital, Charlotte, NC) in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain. But this product doesn't seem to help joint stiffness or function.
Weight loss. Early research suggests that taking willow bark in combination with ephedra and cola nut might cause slight weight loss in overweight and obese people. However, it is not wise to use this combination because of safety concerns about ephedra. Ephedra has been banned in the United States due to severe harmful side effects.
Osteoarthritis. Research on willow bark extract for osteoarthritis has produced conflicting results. Some research shows it can reduce osteoarthritis pain. In fact, there is some evidence suggesting that willow bark extract works as well as conventional medications for osteoarthritis. But other research shows no benefit.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research suggests that willow bark extract is not effective for rheumatoid arthritis.
Joint pain.
Treating fever.
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of willow bark for these uses.",Willow bark contains a chemical called salicin that is similar to aspirin.,"Willow bark is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth for a short time (up to 12 weeks).

It may cause headaches, stomach upset, and digestive system upset. It can also cause itching, rash, and allergic reactions, particularly in people allergic to aspirin.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the safety of using willow bark during pregnancy. It's best to avoid using it.

Using willow bark while breast-feeding is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Willow bark contains chemicals that can enter breast milk and have harmful effects on the nursing infant. Don't use it if you are breast-feeding.
Children: Willow bark is POSSIBLY UNSAFE n children when taken by mouth for viral infections such as colds and flu. There is some concern that, like aspirin, it might increase the risk of developing Reye's syndrome. Stay on the safe side and don't use willow bark in children.
Bleeding disorders: Willow bark might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders.
Kidney disease: Willow bark might reduce blood flow through the kidneys, which might lead to kidney failure in certain people. If you have kidney disease, don't use willow bark.
Sensitivity to aspirin: People with ASTHMA, STOMACH ULCERS, DIABETES, GOUT, HEMOPHILIA, HYPOPROTHROMBINEMIA, or KIDNEY or LIVER DISEASE might be sensitive to aspirin and also willow bark. Using willow bark might cause serious allergic reactions. Avoid use.
Surgery: Willow bark might slow blood clotting. There is a concern it could cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using willow bark at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/955.html,"Wuthold K, Germann I, Roos G, et al.

Yerba mate is a plant. The leaves are used to make medicine.

Some people take yerba mate by mouth to relieve mental and physical tiredness (fatigue), as well as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is also taken by mouth for heart-related complaints including heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and low blood pressure.

Some people also take yerba mate by mouth to improve mood and depression; for diabetes; high cholesterol; weak bones (osteoporosis); to relieve headache and joint pains; to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bladder and kidney stones; for weight loss; and as a laxative. 

In foods, yerba mate is used to make a tea-like beverage. 
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for YERBA MATE are as follows:Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Athletic performance. Early research shows that one dose of yerba mate prior to exercise might reduce hunger before exercising and improve mood after exercising in women. Other research shows that taking yerba mate daily for 5 days might modestly improve exercise performance in trained athletes.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research shows that drinking a beverage containing yerba mate does not improve memory, reaction time, or mental accuracy in healthy females.
Diabetes. Early research shows that drinking yerba mate tea three times daily for 60 days can lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Early research shows that drinking tea containing yerba mate three times daily for 40 days can lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol, in people with high cholesterol. This includes people already taking statin drugs. However, other early research shows that yerba mate does not change lipid levels in adults with HIV who do not already have high cholesterol.
Obesity. Early research shows that taking yerba mate by mouth might decrease fat and cause weight loss when used alone or in combination with guarana and damiana.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Drinking yerba mate tea every day for at least 4 years might reduce the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women. However, other research suggests that yerba mate might not have any effect on the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women.
Prediabetes. Early research shows that drinking yerba mate tea three times daily for 60 days does not reduce fasting blood sugar in people with prediabetes. However, it might reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), a measure of average blood sugar.

More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of  yerba mate for these uses.","Yerba mate contains caffeine and other chemicals which stimulate the brain, heart, muscles lining blood vessels, and other parts of the body.","When taken by mouth:Yerba mate is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken for short periods of time. Yerba mate contains caffeine, which in some people can cause side effects such as inability to sleep (insomnia), nervousness and restlessness, upset stomach, nausea and vomiting, increased heart rate and breathing, and other side effects.

Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken in large amounts or for long periods of time. Consuming large amounts of yerba mate (more than 12 cups daily) might cause headache, anxiety, agitation, ringing in the ears, and irregular heartbeats. Drinking large amounts of yerba mate (1-2 liters daily) also increases the risk of esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and possibly laryngeal or mouth cancer. This risk is especially high for people who smoke or drink alcohol.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. One concern is that using yerba mate seems to increase the risk of getting cancer. It's not known whether that risk is transferred to the developing fetus. Another concern is the caffeine content of yerba mate. Caffeine crosses the placenta and enters the fetus' bloodstream, producing caffeine levels in the fetus that resemble the caffeine level in the mother. In general, mothers should avoid consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily; that's about 6 cups of yerba mate. Infants born to mothers who consume a lot of caffeine during pregnancy sometimes show symptoms of caffeine withdrawal after birth. High doses of caffeine have also been linked with miscarriage, premature delivery, and low birth weight. However, researchers studied mothers who drank yerba mate tea during pregnancy and found no strong link between drinking yerba mate and premature delivery or small birth weight. But this study has been criticized because it did not consider the amount of yerba mate or caffeine used by the mothers; it looked only at how often they used yerba mate.

Yerba mate is also POSSIBLY UNSAFE during breast-feeding. It is not known whether the cancer-causing chemicals in yerba mate pass into breast milk, but that is a concern. The caffeine in yerba mate is also a problem. It might cause irritability and increased bowel movements in nursing infants.
Children: Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for children when taken by mouth. Yerba mate is linked with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and possibly laryngeal or mouth cancer.
Alcoholism: Heavy alcohol use combined with long-term yerba mate use increases the risk of cancer from 3-fold to 7-fold.
Anxiety disorders: The caffeine in yerba mate might make anxiety disorders worse.
Bleeding disorders: Caffeine might slow clotting. As a result, there is a concern that the caffeine in yerba mate might make bleeding disorders worse. But so far, this effect has not been reported in people.
Heart conditions: Caffeine in yerba mate can cause irregular heartbeats in certain people. If you have a heart condition, discuss using yerba mate with your healthcare provider.
Diabetes: Some research shows that the caffeine in yerba mate may affect the way people with diabetes process sugar and may complicate blood sugar control. There is also some interesting research that shows caffeine may make the warning symptoms of low blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes more noticeable. Some studies show that the symptoms of low blood sugar are more intense when they start in the absence of caffeine, but as low blood sugar continues, symptoms are greater with caffeine. This might increase the ability of people with diabetes to detect and treat low blood sugar. However, the downside is that caffeine might actually increase the number of low-sugar episodes. If you have diabetes, talk with your healthcare provider before using yerba mate.
Diarrhea: Yerba mate contains caffeine. The caffeine in yerba mate, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Glaucoma: Using yerba mate increases the pressure inside the eye due to the caffeine it contains. The increase in pressure occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. If you have glaucoma, discuss your use of yerba mate with your healthcare provider.
High blood pressure: Yerba mate contains caffeine. Drinking caffeine might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this effect might be less in people who drink caffeine regularly.  
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Yerba mate contains caffeine. The caffeine in yerba mate, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS.
Weak bones (osteoporosis): Some researchers have found that postmenopausal women who drink 4 cups or more daily of a traditional South American yerba mate tea have higher bone density. But other research shows that yerba mate might not have any effect on the bones of postmenopausal women. Also, the caffeine in yerba mate tends to flush calcium out of the body in the urine. This can contribute to weak bones. If you have osteoporosis, limit caffeine consumption to less than 300 mg per day (approximately 6 cups of yerba mate). Taking extra calcium may help to make up for the calcium that is flushed out. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium from your food and supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine daily (about 8-10 cups of yerba mate) doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women who have an inherited condition that keeps them from processing vitamin D normally, should be especially cautious when using caffeine.

There are some women who are at special risk for weak bones. These women have an inherited condition that makes it hard for them to use vitamin D properly. Vitamin D works with calcium to build strong bones. These women should be especially careful to limit the amount of caffeine they get from yerba mate as well as other sources.
Smoking: The risk of getting cancer is 3 to 7 times higher in people who smoke and use yerba mate for long periods of time.

Zinc is a mineral. It is called an ""essential trace element"" because very small amounts of zinc are necessary for human health. Since the human body does not store excess zinc, it must be consumed regularly as part of the diet. Common dietary sources of zinc include red meat, poultry, and fish. Zinc deficiency can cause short stature, reduced ability to taste food, and the inability of testes and ovaries to function properly.


Zinc is taken by mouth for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency and its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, slow wound healing, and Wilson's disease.


It is also used for boosting the immune system, improving growth and heath in zinc deficient infants and children, for treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, the flu, upper respiratory tract infections, preventing and treating lower respiratory infections, swine flu, bladder infections, ringing in the ears, and severe head injuries. It is also used for malaria and other diseases caused by parasites.

Some people use zinc for an eye disease called macular degeneration, for night blindness, and for cataracts. It is also used for asthma; diabetes and associated nerve damage; high blood pressure; AIDS/HIV, AIDS/HIV-related pregnancy complications; HIV-related diarrhea and AIDS diarrhea-wasting syndrome, AIDS-related infections, and high levels of bilirubin in blood (hyperbilirubinemia).

It is also taken by mouth anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, depression after pregnancy (postpartum depression), dementia, dry mouth, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), blunted sense of taste (hypogeusia), hepatic encephalopathy, alcohol-related liver disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, canker sores, stomach ulcers, leg ulcers, and bed sores.
 
Some men take zinc by mouth for male fertility problems and enlarged prostate, as well as erectile dysfunction (ED).
 
Zinc is taken by mouth for osteoporosis, cysts on the ovaries, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, warts, and muscle cramps in people with liver disease. It is also used for sickle cell disease, itching, rosacea, hair loss, psoriasis, eczema, acne, a blood disorder called thalassemia, Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Hansen's disease, and cystic fibrosis.

It is also taken by mouth for cancer prevention, including esophageal cancer, colon and rectal cancer, stomach cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer recurrence, nasal and throat cancer recurrence, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Zinc is used by mouth to prevent inflammation in the lining of the digestive tract, chemotherapy-related complications, anemia, pregnancy-related complications including iron deficiency, vitamin A deficiency (taken with vitamin A), seizures, arsenic poisoning, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clogged arteries, leukemia, burns, diaper rash, leprosy, and skin lesions caused by leishmania infection.

Some athletes use zinc by mouth for improving athletic performance and strength.


Zinc is also applied to the skin for treating acne, foot ulcers caused by diabetes, leg ulcers, diaper rash, warts, aging skin, brown patches on the face, herpes simplex infections, parasitic infections, and to speed wound healing. Zinc is also applied to the anus for people with problems controlling bowel movements.


Zinc citrate is used in toothpaste and mouthwash to prevent dental plaque formation and gingivitis. Zinc is also used in chew gum, candies, and mouth rinses to treat bad breath.

There is a zinc preparation that can be sprayed in the nostrils for treating the common cold.

Zinc sulfate is used in eye drop solutions to treat eye irritation.

Zinc is injected into the vein to improve nutrition in people recovering from burns.


Note that many zinc products also contain another metal called cadmium. This is because zinc and cadmium are chemically similar and often occur together in nature. Exposure to high levels of cadmium over a long time can lead to kidney failure. The concentration of cadmium in zinc-containing supplements can vary as much as 37-fold. Look for zinc-gluconate products. Zinc gluconate consistently contains the lowest cadmium levels.
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ZINC are as follows:Effective for...Zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency might occur in people with severe diarrhea, conditions that make it hard for the bowel to absorb food, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism. It may also occur after major surgery and during long-term use of tube feeding in the hospital. Taking zinc by mouth or giving zinc intravenously (by IV) helps to restore zinc levels in people who are zinc deficient. However, taking zinc supplements regularly is not recommended.
Likely effective for...Diarrhea. Taking zinc by mouth reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea in children who are undernourished or zinc deficient. Severe zinc deficiency in children is common in developing countries. Also giving zinc to undernourished women during pregnancy and for one month after delivery reduces the incidence of diarrhea in infants during the first year of life.
An inherited disorder that causes copper to build up in many organs (Wilson disease). Taking zinc by mouth improves symptoms of an inherited disorder called Wilson disease. People with Wilson disease have too much copper in their bodies. Zinc blocks how much copper is absorbed and increases how much copper the body releases.
Possibly effective for...Acne. Research suggests that people with acne have lower blood and skin levels of zinc. Taking zinc by mouth appears to help treat acne. However, it's unclear how beneficial zinc is compared to acne medications such as tetracycline or minocycline. Applying zinc to the skin in an ointment does not seem to help treat acne unless used in combination with the antibiotic drug called erythromycin.
A disorder of zinc deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica). Taking zinc by mouth seems to help improve symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica. 
An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). People who consume more zinc as part of their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing age-related vision loss. Research shows that taking supplements containing zinc and antioxidant vitamins may modestly slow vision loss and prevent age-related vision loss from becoming advanced in people at high risk. It's still not clear if taking zinc along with antioxidant vitamins helps prevent age-related vision loss from becoming advanced in people at low risk. Most research shows that taking zinc alone, without antioxidant vitamins, does not help most people with age-related vision loss. However, it's possible that people with certain genes that make them susceptible to age-related vision loss might benefit from zinc supplements.
An eating disorder (anorexia nervosa). Taking zinc supplements by mouth might help increase weight gain and improve depression symptoms in teens and adults with anorexia.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is evidence that children with ADHD might have lower blood levels of zinc than children without ADHD. There is also evidence that people with ADHD who have lower zinc levels might not respond well enough to prescription medications for ADHD (stimulants). Thus, zinc supplements are of interest for people with ADHD. Taking zinc by mouth along with medicine for ADHD might slightly improve hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and socialization problems in some children with ADHD. But zinc doesn't seem to improve attention span. Most studies using zinc for ADHD have taken place in the Middle East, where zinc deficiency is more common than in Western countries. One small study shows that taking zinc alone or as add-on therapy to prescription ADHD medication does not consistently improve symptoms of ADHD. But it does seem to lower the optimal dose of ADHD medication that is needed.
Burns. Giving zinc intravenously (by IV) together with other minerals seems to improve wound healing in people with burns. However, taking zinc alone does not appear to improve wound healing in all people with burns, but it might reduce recovery time in people with severe burns.
Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Research suggests that taking a supplement containing selenium, zinc, vitamin A 2, vitamin C, and vitamin E by mouth daily for 5 years reduces the risk of recurrent large-bowel tumors by about 40%.
Common cold. Although some conflicting results exist, most research shows that taking lozenges containing zinc gluconate or zinc acetate by mouth helps reduce the duration of a cold in adults. However, side effects such as bad taste and nausea might limit its usefulness. It is unclear if zinc helps prevent common colds. In adults, taking zinc supplements by mouth does not seem to prevent common colds. However, zinc gluconate lozenges might help prevent colds in children and adolescents. Using zinc as a nose spray does not seem to help prevent colds.
Depression. Early research suggests that zinc levels are lower in people with depression. Ingesting more zinc is associated with less risk of depression. Some research suggests that taking zinc along with antidepressants improves depression in people with major depression. However, other research shows that it improves depression in only people who do not respond to treatment with antidepressants alone. It doesn't seem to improve depression in people who respond to antidepressant treatment.
Foot sores in people with diabetes. Research suggests that applying zinc hyaluronate gel can help foot ulcers heal faster than conventional treatment in people with diabetes.
Diaper rash. Giving zinc gluconate by mouth to infants seems to speed up the healing of diaper rash. Applying zinc oxide paste also seems to improve the healing of diaper rash. However, it doesn't seem to work as well as applying 2% eosin solution.
A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). Using toothpastes containing zinc, with or without an antibacterial agent, appears to prevent plaque and gingivitis. Some evidence also shows that zinc-containing toothpaste can reduce existing plaque. However, other conventional treatments may be more effective. Also, most studies that showed benefit used zinc citrate in combination with triclosan, which is not available in the US.
Bad breath. Research suggests that chewing gum, sucking on a candy, or using a mouth rinse containing zinc reduces bad breath.
Cold sores (herpes labialis). Applying zinc sulfate or zinc oxide to the skin, alone or with other ingredients, seems to reduce the duration and severity of oral and genital herpes. However, zinc might not be beneficial for recurrent herpes infections.
Reduced ability to taste (hypogeusia). Some early research suggests that taking zinc by mouth does not improve taste disorders in children with zinc deficiency. But most evidence suggests that taking zinc by mouth is effective for people with a reduced ability to taste foods due to zinc deficiency or some other conditions.
Skin infection caused by Leishmania parasites (Leishmania lesions). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate by mouth or injecting as a solution into lesions helps heal lesions in people with Leishmaniasis. However, injecting zinc solutions into lesions does not seem to be more effective than conventional treatments.
Leprosy. Taking zinc by mouth in combination with anti-leprosy drugs seems to help treat leprosy. 
Muscle cramps. Taking zinc by mouth seems to help treat muscle cramps in people with cirrhosis and zinc deficiency.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Low zinc intake seems to be linked to lower bone mass. Taking a zinc supplement in combination with copper, manganese, and calcium might decrease bone loss in women who have passed menopause.
Stomach ulcers. Taking zinc acexamate by mouth seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers. However, this form of zinc is not available in the US.
Sore throat (pharyngitis). Using a zinc lozenge before surgery that involves having a tube placed into the windpipe seems to reduce the chance of having a sore throat after surgery.
Pneumonia. Most research suggests that taking zinc might help PREVENT pneumonia in undernourished children. However, research assessing the effects of zinc for TREATING pneumonia once it develops shows conflicting.
Preterm birth. Taking zinc by mouth during pregnancy appears to reduce the risk for early delivery. But zinc supplementation doesn't seem to reduce the risk for stillbirths, miscarriage, or infant deaths.
Bed sores (pressure ulcers). Applying zinc paste appears to help improve the healing of bed sores in elderly people. Also, increasing zinc intake in the diet seems to improve bed sore healing in hospitalized patients with bed sore.
Illness from a Shigella bacteria infection (shigellosis). Research shows that taking a multivitamin syrup containing zinc along with conventional treatment can improve recovery time and reduce diarrhea in undernourished children with food poisoning.
Sickle cell disease. Taking zinc by mouth seems to help reduce symptoms of sickle cell disease in people with zinc deficiency. Taking zinc supplements also appears to decrease the risk for complications and infections related to sickle cell disease.
Leg sores caused by weak blood circulation (venous leg ulcer). Taking zinc sulfate by mouth appears to help some types of leg ulcers heal faster. The effects seem to be greater in people with low levels of zinc before treatment. Applying zinc paste to leg ulcers also appears to improve healing.
Vitamin A deficiency. Taking zinc by mouth together with vitamin A seems to improve vitamin A levels in undernourished children better than vitamin A or zinc alone.
Warts. Early research suggests that applying a zinc sulfate solution improves plane warts but not common warts. Applying zinc oxide ointment appears to be as effective as conventional treatments for curing warts. Taking zinc sulfate by mouth also appears to be effective.

Possibly ineffective for...
Patchy hair loss (alopecia areata). Although there is early evidence that suggests taking zinc together with biotin might be helpful for hair loss, most studies suggest that zinc is not effective for this condition.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Taking zinc by mouth does not appear to improve skin redness or itching in children with eczema.
Cataracts. Taking zinc by mouth together with antioxidant vitamins does not seem to help treat or prevent cataracts.
Cystic fibrosis. Zinc sulfate does not appear to improve lung function in children or adolescents with cystic fibrosis, although it may reduce the need for antibiotics.
HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth along with antiretroviral therapy does not improve immune function or reduce the risk of death in adults or children with HIV.
Pregnancy complications in women with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant. Also, zinc does not appear to prevent infant death or maternal wasting in pregnant women with HIV.
Involuntary weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth together with vitamins does not seem to improve AIDS diarrhea-wasting syndrome.
Infant development. Giving zinc to infants or children at risk for having low levels of zinc does not seem to improve mental or motor development. But giving zinc to women during pregnancy might increase the growth of the child during the first year of life.
Long-term swelling (inflammation) in the digestive tract (inflammatory bowel disease or IBD). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat IBD.
Flu (influenza). Taking zinc supplements by mouth is unlikely to improve immune function against the flu virus in people who are not at risk for zinc deficiency.
Ear infection (otitis media). Taking zinc does not appear to prevent ear infections in children.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Taking zinc does not seem to reduce the risk of high blood pressure in pregnancy.
Low iron levels in women who are pregnant. Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help improve iron levels in women taking iron and folic acid supplements.
Prostate cancer. Taking zinc does not seem to be linked to the risk of getting prostate cancer.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat psoriasis.
Joint swelling (inflammation) in people with psoriasis. Taking zinc by mouth, alone or together with painkillers, has no effect on the progression of psoriatic arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat rheumatoid arthritis.
A skin condition that causes redness on the face (rosacea). Research suggests that taking zinc by mouth daily for 90 days does not improve quality of life or symptoms associated with rosacea.
Sexual problems that prevent satisfaction during sexual activity. Research suggests that zinc supplementation does not improve sexual function in men with sexual dysfunction related to kidney disease.
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treating ringing in the ears.
Upper airway infection. Taking zinc by mouth does not decrease the risk for upper respiratory tract infections.

Likely ineffective for...Malaria. Taking zinc by mouth does not help prevent or treat malaria in undernourished children in developing countries. But some research suggests it might reduce the risk for high fevers in children with malaria. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Liver disease in people who drink alcohol. Taking zinc sulfate by mouth might improve liver function in people with alcohol-related liver disease.
Alzheimer disease. Some early research shows that zinc supplements might slow the worsening of symptoms in people with Alzheimer disease.
Arsenic poisoning. Early research suggests that taking zinc together with spirulina can reduce symptoms and arsenic levels in the urine and hair of people with long-term arsenic poisoning.
Asthma. Zinc intake does not appear to be linked to the risk for developing asthma in children.
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Early research suggests that taking zinc sulfate while undergoing blood transfusions increases growth in children with beta-thalassemia compared to blood transfusions alone.
Brain tumor. Early research suggests that zinc intake is not linked with a reduced risk of developing brain cancer.
Swelling (inflammation) of small airways in the lung (bronchiolitis). Taking zinc while in the hospital might speed up recovery from this type of airway infection.
Canker sores. Some early research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves canker sores and prevents them from reappearing. However, other research shows no benefit.
Tiredness in people treated with cancer drugs. Early research shows that taking zinc does not reduce tiredness or improve life quality in people with colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy.
A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). Early research suggests that taking zinc daily after recovery from COPD-related infections reduces the risk of additional infections in older people.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Increased intake of zinc has been linked to a 17% to 20% reduced risk of colorectal cancer.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that taking zinc reduces cholesterol but not triglycerides in people with clogged arteries.
Diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves behavior and social abilities in people with memory loss.
Tooth plaque. Early evidence suggests that brushing teeth with toothpaste containing zinc reduces plaque buildup.
Diabetes. Research suggests that taking zinc alone or with other nutrients reduces blood sugar in healthy people and in those with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or obesity. Also, taking zinc might help to lower blood sugar in women who develop diabetes during pregnancy. But it doesn't seem to reduce the need for a caesarean section during labor in these women.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves nerve function and reduces blood sugar in people with nerve damage caused by diabetes.
Down syndrome. Early research suggests that taking zinc can improve immune function and reduce infections in people with Down syndrome who are zinc deficient and have weakened immune systems. However, other research shows conflicting results.
Seizure disorder (epilepsy). Taking zinc might reduce how often seizures occur in children not responding well to other treatments.
Cancer of the esophagus. Early research has linked low intake of zinc with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. However, other early research shows that zinc intake is not linked with the risk of esophageal cancer. It's possible that the source of zinc (plant vs. meat) affects how beneficial it is.
Loss of bowel movement control (fecal incontinence). Research suggests that applying an ointment containing zinc and aluminum to the anus three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms and quality of life in women with a loss of control of bowel movements.
Stomach cancer. Early research shows that increased zinc intake is not linked to a lower risk of stomach cancer.
Head and neck cancer. Early research suggests that zinc supplementation does not improve survival rates or reduce the spread of cancer after 3 years in people with head and neck cancer.
Reduced brain function in people with advanced liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy). Early research suggests that taking zinc may slightly improve mental function in people with hepatic encephalopathy. However, zinc does not appear to improve disease severity or recurrence.
Diarrhea in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc long-term might help prevent diarrhea in adults with HIV who have low blood levels of zinc. However, zinc doesn't seem to help treat diarrhea in adults with HIV-related diarrhea. In children with HIV, some research shows that taking zinc reduces the occurrence of diarrhea compared to placebo (sugar pills). But other research shows that it doesn't help prevent diarrhea compared to vitamin A.
Certain infections (opportunistic infections) in people with HIV/AIDS. There is some early evidence that taking zinc supplements by mouth in combination with the drug zidovudine might reduce infections that occur because of a weakened immune system. However, it might negatively affect survival in people with AIDS.
Infection of the intestines by parasites. Taking zinc alone or along with vitamin A might help treat some, but not all, parasite infections in children in developing countries. Also, some research suggests that taking zinc with vitamin A reduces the risk for some infections. However, other research suggests that zinc does not reduce the risk for infection.
Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). Research suggests that taking zinc by mouth helps improve weight gain and reduces infection rate in children and adolescents with leukemia. However, zinc does not appear to improve nutrient levels in the body so that the body can function properly.
Infants born weighing less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces). Taking zinc during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a newborn with low birth weight. Giving zinc to underweight infants in developing countries seems to decrease the risk of death, prevent certain complications, and improve mental ability. Giving zinc supplementation to low birth weight infants industrialized countries also seems to help prevent some complications and death. But zinc doesn't appear to improve growth in low birth weight infants from industrialized countries.
Conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). Some early research suggests that zinc supplementation increases sperm count, testosterone levels, and pregnancy rates in infertile men with low testosterone levels. Other research suggests that taking zinc can improve sperm shape in men with moderate enlargement of a vein in the scrotum (grade III varicocele). However, in men with fertility problems due to diseases or medical treatment, taking zinc has produced mixed results.
Dark skin patches on the face (melasma). Research suggests that applying a solution containing zinc to the skin daily for 2 months is less effective than standard skin bleaching treatment for people with brown patches on the face.
Cancer of the upper part of the throat behind the nose (nasopharyngeal cancer). Early research suggests that taking zinc improves survival rates after 5 years in people with a rare type of advanced nose and throat cancer.
Yellowing of the skin in infants (neonatal jaundice). Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily for 7 days does not improve jaundice in newborns.
Injury to the brain, spine, or nerves (neurological trauma). Administering zinc immediately after a head trauma seems to improve the rate of recovery.
Cancer that starts in white blood cells (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Early research suggests that zinc supplementation is linked to a decreased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
A type of anxiety marked by recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviors (obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD). Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily along with the drug fluoxetine for 8 weeks reduces OCD symptoms slightly more than taking fluoxetine alone.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Research shows that taking zinc sulfate by mouth while undergoing radiation therapy helps prevent ulcers and swelling in the mouth caused by radiation treatments. Some research shows that taking zinc sulfate by mouth reduces the severity of mouth ulcers in adults undergoing chemotherapy. However, taking zinc does appear to improve mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy in children and adolescents. Zinc does not appear to reduce mouth ulcers in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Some research shows that taking zinc helps prevent hair loss on the head and hair growth on the face in women with PCOS who are also taking a medication called metformin. Taking zinc does not seem to improve acne or levels of hormones in the body.
Recovery after surgery. Early research suggests that taking zinc reduces the healing time after surgery used to treat an abnormal skin growth located at the tailbone (pilonidal surgery).
Swelling (inflammation) of the prostate due to infection. Taking zinc along with the drug prazosin does not seem to improve the ability to urinate or quality of life compared to taking prazosin alone in men with prostate swelling. But zinc might help to relive pain in some people with this condition.
Itching. Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily for 2 months reduces itching in people with kidney disease who are experiencing itching due to dialysis treatment.
Seizures. Febrile seizures are seizures that occur during a fever. Taking zinc might prevent these seizures in children who already experienced one.
Blood infection (sepsis). Taking zinc along with antibiotics might protect the brain of newborns with sepsis. It isn't known if taking zinc can help these babies live longer.
Infections of the kidney, bladder, or urethra (urinary tract infections or UTIs). Early research shows that taking zinc helps to improve some symptoms of a bladder infection faster in children who are also taking antibiotics. Taking zinc might reduce how often they need to go to the bathroom. It doesn't seem to help with fever or to kill the bacteria in the bladder.
Wound healing. Early research suggests that applying a zinc solution twice daily improves wound healing compared to applying a saline solution. However, applying zinc-containing insulin (Humulin by Eli Lilly and Company) seems to work better than solution containing zinc alone.
Skin wrinkles from sun damage. A skin cream containing 10% vitamin C as L-ascorbic acid and acetyl tyrosine, zinc sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, and bioflavonoids (Cellex-C High Potency Serum) applied for 3 months to facial skin aged by sun exposure seems to improve fine and coarse wrinkling, yellowing, roughness, and skin tone.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease).
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis).
Other conditions.

More evidence is needed to rate zinc for these uses.","Zinc is needed for the proper growth and maintenance of the human body.  It is found in several systems and biological reactions, and it is needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more.  Meats, seafood, dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains offer relatively high levels of zinc.

Zinc deficiency is not uncommon worldwide, but is rare in the US. Symptoms include slowed growth, low insulin levels, loss of appetite, irritability, generalized hair loss, rough and dry skin, slow wound healing, poor sense of taste and smell, diarrhea, and nausea.  Moderate zinc deficiency is associated with disorders of the intestine which interfere with food absorption (malabsorption syndromes), alcoholism, chronic kidney failure, and chronic debilitating diseases.

Zinc plays a key role in maintaining vision, and it is present in high concentrations in the eye.  Zinc deficiency can alter vision, and severe deficiency can cause changes in the retina (the back of the eye where an image is focused).

Zinc might also have effects against viruses.  It appears to lessen symptoms of the rhinovirus (common cold), but researchers can't yet explain exactly how this works.  In addition, there is some evidence that zinc has some antiviral activity against the herpes virus.
Low zinc levels can be associated with male infertility, sickle cell disease, HIV, major depression, and type 2 diabetes, and can be fought by taking a zinc supplement.","When taken by mouth: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth in amounts not larger than 40 mg daily. Routine zinc supplementation is not recommended without the advice of a healthcare professional. In some people, zinc might cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, kidney and stomach damage, and other side effects. Zinc is POSSIBLY SAFE when taking by mouth in doses greater than 40 mg daily. There is some concern that taking doses higher than 40 mg daily might decrease how much copper the body absorbs. Decreased copper absorption may cause anemia. Taking high amounts of zinc is LIKELY UNSAFE. High doses above the recommended amounts might cause fever, coughing, stomach pain, fatigue, and many other problems. Taking more than 100 mg of supplemental zinc daily or taking supplemental zinc for 10 or more years doubles the risk of developing prostate cancer. There is also concern that taking large amounts of a multivitamin plus a separate zinc supplement increases the chance of dying from prostate cancer. Taking 450 mg or more of zinc daily can cause problems with blood iron. Single doses of 10-30 grams of zinc can be fatal.
When applied to the skin: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when applied to the skin. Using zinc on broken skin may cause burning, stinging, itching, and tingling.
When inhaled: Zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when inhaled through the nose, as it might cause permanent loss of smell. In June 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised consumers not to use certain zinc-containing nose sprays (Zicam) after receiving over 100 reports of loss of smell. The maker of these zinc-containing nose sprays has also received several hundred reports of loss of smell from people who had used the products. Avoid using nose sprays containing zinc.


Special precautions & warnings:
Infants and children: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately in the recommended amounts. Zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most pregnant and breast-feeding women when used in the recommended daily amounts (RDA). However, zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses by breast-feeding women and LIKELY UNSAFE when used in high doses by pregnant women. Pregnant women over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc per day; pregnant women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 34 mg per day. Breast-feeding women over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc per day; breast-feeding women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 34 mg per day.
Alcoholism: Long-term, excessive alcohol drinking is linked to poor zinc absorption in the body.
Diabetes:  Large doses of zinc can lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should use zinc products cautiously. 
Hemodialysis: People receiving hemodialysis treatments seem to be at risk for zinc deficiency and might require zinc supplements.
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)/AIDS: Use zinc cautiously if you have HIV/AIDS. Zinc use has been linked to shorter survival time in people with HIV/AIDs.
Syndromes in which it is difficult for the body to absorb nutrients: People with malabsorption syndromes may be zinc deficient.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): People with RA absorb less zinc.
Vegetarianism: Vegetarian diets are often linked with lower zinc absorption. So this type of diet is considered a risk factor for zinc depletion. But the body adapts over the long term. It becomes better at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc loss.

5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) is a chemical by-product of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is also produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia
5-HTP is used for sleep disorders such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, migraine and tension-type headaches, fibromyalgia, obesity, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), seizure disorder, and Parkinson's disease..
","Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for 5-HTP are as follows:Possibly effective for...Depression. Some clinical research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth improve symptoms of depression in some people. Some clinical research shows that taking 5-HTP by mouth might be as beneficial as certain prescription antidepressant drugs for improving depression symptoms. In most studies, 150-800 mg daily of 5-HTP was taken. In some cases, higher doses have been used.
Possibly ineffective for...	Down syndrome. Some research shows that giving 5-HTP to infants with Down syndrome might improve muscle and activity. Other research shows that it does not improve muscle or development when taken from infancy until 3-4 years of age. Research also shows that taking 5-HTP along with conventional prescription drugs does improve development, social skills, or language skills.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Alcoholism. Early research shows that taking 5-HTP with D-phenylalanine and L-glutamine for 40 days can reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, taking 5-HTP with carbidopa daily for one year does not seem to help people stop drinking. The effect of 5-HTP alone for alcoholism is not clear. 
Alzheimer's disease. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not help symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. 
Anxiety. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for anxiety is unclear. Early research shows that taking 25-150 mg of 5-HTP by mouth daily along with carbidopa seems to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. However, other early research shows that taking higher doses of 5-HTP, 225 mg daily or more, seems to make anxiety worse. Also, taking 60 mg of 5-HTP daily through the vein does not reduce anxiety in people with panic disorders. 
Nervous system disorder (Cerebellar ataxia). Evidence on the use of 5-HTP for cerebellar ataxia is unclear. Early evidence shows that taking 5 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 4 months can decrease nervous system dysfunction. However, other research shows that taking 5-HTP daily for up to one year does not improve symptoms of cerebellar ataxia. 
Fibromyalgia. Early research suggests that taking 100 mg of  5-HTP by mouth three times daily for 30-90 days might improve pain, tenderness, sleep, anxiety, fatigue, and morning stiffness in people with fibromyalgia. 
Menopausal symptoms. Early research suggests that taking 150 mg of 5-HTP daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women. 
Migraine headache. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for the prevention or treatment of migraines in adults is unclear. Some studies show that taking 5-HTP daily does not reduce migraines, while other studies show that it might be as beneficial as prescription drugs. 5-HTP does not seem to reduce migraines in children. 
Obesity. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP might help reduce appetite, caloric intake, and weight in obese people. Other research suggests that using a specific mouth spray containing 5-HTP and other extracts (5-HTP-Nat Exts, Medestea Biotech S.p.a., Torino, Italy) for 4 weeks increases weight loss by about 41% in overweight postmenopausal women. 
Parkinson's disease. Early research shows that taking 100-150 mg of 5-HTP by mouth daily with conventional drugs seems to reduce shaking, but these benefits only continue for up to 5 months. Taking larger doses of 5-HTP, 275-1500 mg daily along with carbidopa seems to worsen symptoms. 
Schizophrenia. Early research suggests that taking 800 mg to 6 grams of 5-HTP daily with carbidopa for 90 days might improve schizophrenia symptoms in some young men. 
Tension headache. Early research suggests that taking 100 mg of 5-HTP three times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce pain or the length of tension headaches. 
Heroin withdrawal symptoms. Early research suggests that taking 200 mg of 5-HTP daily for 6 days together with tyrosine, phosphatidylcholine, and L-glutamine, might reduce insomnia and withdrawal symptoms in recovering heroin addicts. 
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Insomnia.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
Ramsey-Hunt syndrome.
Other conditions.


More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of 5-HTP for these uses.
","5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation.  Since 5-HTP increases the synthesis of serotonin, it is used for several diseases where serotonin is believed to play an important role including depression, insomnia, obesity, and many other conditions.","5-HTP is POSSIBLY SAFE when taking by mouth appropriately. 5-HTP has been used safely in doses up to 400 mg daily for up to one year. However, some people who have taken it have developed a condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition involving extreme muscle tenderness (myalgia) and blood abnormalities (eosinophilia). Some people think EMS might be caused by an accidental ingredient or contaminant in some 5-HTP products. However, there is not enough scientific evidence to know if EMS is caused by 5-HTP, a contaminant, or some other factor. Until more is known, 5-HTP should be used cautiously.

Other potential side effects of 5-HTP include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, and muscle problems.

5-HTP is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth in large doses. Doses from 6-10 grams daily have been linked to severe stomach problems and muscle spasms.

Special precautions & warnings:
Children: 5-HTP is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Doses of up to 5 mg/kg daily have been used safely for up to 3 years in infants and children up to 12 years-old. As with adults, there is also concern about the potential for eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in children, a serious condition involving extreme muscle tenderness (myalgia) and blood abnormalities (eosinophilia).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking 5-HTP if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Surgery: 5-HTP can affect a brain chemical called serotonin. Some drugs administered during surgery can also affect serotonin. Taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.",https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/794.html,"Michelson D, Page SW, Casey R, et al.
