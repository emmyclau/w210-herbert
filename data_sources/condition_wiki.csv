abdominal colic,114,Horse colic,"Colic in horses is defined as abdominal pain, but it is a clinical symptom rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The most common forms of colic are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance. There are a variety of different causes of colic, some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. Colic surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major abdominal surgery, often with intensive aftercare. Among domesticated horses, colic is the leading cause of premature death. The incidence of colic in the general horse population has been estimated between 4 and 10 percent over the course of the average lifespan.

"acidosis, lactic",637,Lactic acidosis,"Lactic acidosis is a medical condition characterized by the buildup of lactate (especially L-lactate) in the body, with formation of an excessively low pH in the bloodstream.
It is a form of metabolic acidosis, in which excessive acid accumulates due to a problem with the body's oxidative metabolism.
Lactic acidosis is typically the result of an underlying acute or chronic medical condition, medication, or poisoning.
The diagnosis is made on biochemical analysis of blood (often initially on arterial blood gas samples), and once confirmed, generally prompts an investigation to establish the underlying cause to treat the acidosis.
In some situations, hemofiltration (purification of the blood) is temporarily required.
In rare chronic forms of lactic acidosis caused by mitochondrial disease, a specific diet or dichloroacetate may be used.
The prognosis of lactic acidosis depends largely on the underlying cause; in some situations (such as severe infections), it indicates an increased risk of death.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis,"[('Classification',), ('Signs and symptoms',), ('Causes',), ('Pathophysiology',), ('Diagnosis',), ('Treatment',), ('Prognosis',), ('Other animals', 'Reptiles'), ('Other animals', 'Ruminants'), ('References',)]"

Although adenomas are benign, they should be treated as pre-cancerous. Over time adenomas may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform. However, even though benign, they have the potential to cause serious health complications by compressing other structures (mass effect) and by producing large amounts of hormones in an unregulated, non-feedback-dependent manner (causing paraneoplastic syndromes).

allergic rhinitis (disorder),771,Rhinitis,"Common symptoms are a stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, and post-nasal drip.The inflammation is caused by viruses, bacteria, irritants or allergens.
The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis, which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander.
Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache, fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment.
The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus, commonly producing a runny nose, as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip.
In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose.
When mast cells degranulate, they release histamine and other chemicals, starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise.

These ulcers occur periodically and heal completely between attacks.
In the majority of cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year.
Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces.

If this process is left untreated, the appendix may burst, releasing bacteria into the abdominal cavity, leading to increased complications.The diagnosis of appendicitis is largely based on the person's signs and symptoms.
However, ultrasound may be preferred as the first imaging test in children and pregnant women because of the risks associated with radiation exposure from CT scans.The standard treatment for acute appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix.

beta thalassemia,415,Beta thalassemia,"Beta thalassemias (β thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders.
They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals.
Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.
The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation.HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis.
The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads to the underproduction of HbA.
Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia.
Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB protein for sufficient red blood cell functioning.
Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions to make up for the blockage in the beta-chains.
Repeated blood transfusions cause severe problems associated with iron overload.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_thalassemia,"[('Signs and symptoms',), ('Cause', 'Mutations'), ('Cause', 'mRNA assembly'), ('Risk factors',), ('Diagnosis', 'DNA analysis'), ('Prevention',), ('Treatment', 'Beta thalassemia major', 'Surgical'), ('Treatment', 'Beta thalassemia major', 'Therapeutic'), ('Treatment', 'Beta thalassemia major', 'Pharmaceutical'), ('Treatment', 'Beta thalassemia intermedia'), ('Treatment', 'Beta thalassemia minor'), ('Epidemiology', 'Evolutionary adaptation'), ('Epidemiology', 'Incidence'), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',)]"

However, deficiencies can be caused by consuming raw egg whites over a period of months to years.
Egg whites contain high levels of avidin, a protein that binds biotin strongly.
When cooked, avidin is partially denatured and binding to biotin is reduced.
However, cooked egg whites are safer to consume.

Exposure of blood to the subendothelial space initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma factor VII, which ultimately leads to cross-linked fibrin formation.
Platelets immediately form a plug at the site of injury; this is called primary hemostasis.

Strictly speaking, body weight is the measurement of weight without items located on the person. Practically though, body weight may be measured with clothes on, but without shoes or heavy accessories such as mobile phones and wallets, and using manual or digital weighing scales. Excess or reduced body weight is regarded as an indicator of determining a person's health, with body volume measurement providing an extra dimension by calculating the distribution of body weight.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_weight,"[('Estimation in children',), ('Fluctuation',), ('Ideal body weight', 'Devine formula'), ('Ideal body weight', 'Hamwi method'), ('Usage', 'Sports'), ('Usage', 'Medicine'), ('Average weight around the world', 'By region'), ('Average weight around the world', 'By country', 'Global statistics'), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

brain,306,Brain,"A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.
It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.
In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion.
Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs.
Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.
This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates.

carrying,401,Carried interest,"Carried interest, or carry, in finance, is a share of the profits of an investment paid to the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership, specifically in alternative investments (private equity and hedge funds).
In private equity, the standard carried-interest allocation historically has been 20% for funds making buyout and venture investments.
In private equity, the distribution of carried interest is directed by a distribution waterfall: to receive carried interest, the manager must first return all capital contributed by the investors and, in certain cases, a previously agreed-upon rate of return (the ""hurdle rate"" or ""preferred return"") to investors.
The customary hurdle rate in private equity is 7–8% per annum.In a hedge fund environment, carried interest is usually referred to as a ""performance fee"" and because it invests in liquid investments, it is often able to pay carried interest annually if the fund has generated a profit.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carried_interest,"[('Definition and history', 'Management Fees'), ('Taxation', 'United States'), ('Taxation', 'United Kingdom'), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',)]"

Frequently, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative, and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi.
People may have severe symptoms and be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved.
Increasingly, the diagnosis is being made in people without symptoms, as a result of screening.
While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins, it is distinct from wheat allergy, which is much rarer.The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestinal mucosa, improves symptoms and reduces risk of developing complications in most people.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease,"[('Signs and symptoms', 'Gastrointestinal'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Malabsorption-related'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Miscellaneous'), ('Cause', 'Other grains'), ('Cause', 'Risk modifiers'), ('Pathophysiology', 'Genetics'), ('Pathophysiology', 'Prolamins'), ('Pathophysiology', 'Tissue transglutaminase'), ('Pathophysiology', 'Villous atrophy and malabsorption'), ('Diagnosis', 'Blood tests'), ('Diagnosis', 'Endoscopy'), ('Diagnosis', 'Pathology'), ('Diagnosis', 'Other diagnostic tests'), ('Diagnosis', 'Gluten withdrawal'), ('Screening',), ('Treatment', 'Diet'), ('Treatment', 'Refractory disease'), ('Epidemiology',), ('History',), ('Social and culture', 'Christian churches and the Eucharist', 'Roman Catholic position'), ('Social and culture', 'Passover'), ('Social and culture', 'Spelling'), ('Research directions',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.The main risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure.
An ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes.
A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either  bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes.

Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools.Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss.
The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin.

Progression continues throughout the individual's life, but both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family.Choroideremia is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the CHM gene which encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), a protein involved in lipid modification of Rab proteins.
While the complete mechanism of disease is not fully understood, the lack of a functional protein in the retina results in cell death and the gradual deterioration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors and the choroid.As of 2019, there is no treatment for choroideremia; however, retinal gene therapy clinical trials have demonstrated a possible treatment.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choroideremia,"[('Presentation',), ('Diagnosis',), ('Management', 'Gene therapy'), ('Management', 'Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis'), ('Management', 'Other potential therapies'), ('Research', 'History'), ('Research', 'Basic research'), ('Culture',), ('References',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"

Most people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water without difficulty or adverse health effects.
A five to eight percent decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness.
Loss of over ten percent of total body water can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst.
Death occurs at a loss of between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the body water.

drinking water,649,Drinking water,"Drinking water, also known as potable water, is water that is safe to drink or to use for food preparation.
The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions.
Liquid water, along with air pressure, nutrients, and solar energy, is essential for life.Typically in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation.
Other typical uses include washing, toilets, and irrigation.
Globally, by 2015, 89% of people had access to water from a source that is suitable for drinking – called improved water source.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, access to potable water ranged from 40% to 80% of the population.

drug tolerance,424,Drug tolerance,"Drug tolerance is a pharmacological concept describing subjects' reduced reaction to a drug following its repeated use.
Increasing its dosage may re-amplify the drug's effects; however, this may accelerate tolerance, further reducing the drug's effects.
Drug tolerance is indicative of drug use but is not necessarily associated with drug dependence or addiction.
The process of tolerance development is reversible (e.g., through a drug holiday) and can involve both physiological factors and psychological factors.One may also develop drug tolerance to side effects, in which case tolerance is a desirable characteristic.
A medical intervention that has an objective to increase tolerance (e.g., allergen immunotherapy, in which one is exposed to larger and larger amounts of allergen to decrease one's allergic reactions) is called drug desensitization.The opposite concept to drug tolerance is drug reverse tolerance (or drug sensitization), in which case the subject's reaction or effect will increase following its repeated use.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_tolerance,"[('Tachyphylaxis',), ('Pharmacodynamic tolerance',), ('Pharmacokinetic (metabolic) tolerance',), ('Behavioral tolerance',), ('See also',)]"

Diagnosis is mostly based on the symptoms, though a number of other tests may be used.Treatment depends on the underlying cause.
Artificial tears are the usual first line treatment.
The medication ciclosporin or steroid eye drops may be used in some cases.
Another option is lacrimal plugs that prevent tears from draining from the surface of the eye.

Diagnosis is by inspecting the gum tissue around the teeth both visually and with a probe and X-rays looking for bone loss around the teeth.Treatment involves good oral hygiene and regular professional teeth cleaning.
Recommended oral hygiene include daily brushing and flossing.
In certain cases antibiotics or dental surgery may be recommended.

GvHD also applies to other forms of transplanted tissues such as solid organ transplants.
White blood cells of the donor's immune system which remain within the donated tissue (the graft) recognize the recipient (the host) as foreign (non-self).
The white blood cells present within the transplanted tissue then attack the recipient's body's cells, which leads to GvHD.
This should not be confused with a transplant rejection, which occurs when the immune system of the transplant recipient rejects the transplanted tissue; GvHD occurs when the donor's immune system's white blood cells reject the recipient.

immune system processes,609,Immune system,"The immune system is a host defense system comprising many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.
To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as pathogens, from viruses to parasitic worms, and distinguish them from the organism's own healthy tissue.
Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens.
Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.
Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.

Peripheral tolerance is key to preventing over-reactivity of the immune system to various environmental entities (allergens, gut microbes, etc.).
Deficits in central or peripheral tolerance also cause autoimmune disease, resulting in syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1),   and immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX), and potentially contribute to asthma, allergy, and inflammatory bowel disease.
And immune tolerance in pregnancy is what allows a mother animal to gestate a genetically distinct offspring with an alloimmune response muted enough to prevent miscarriage.

These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place.
Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts.
The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancer.

Maturity maintenance concerns the maintenance of defence systems (such as the immune system), and the preparation of the body for reproduction.The theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily during starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation conditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which causes shrinking.

malignant tumor of colon,174,Benign tumor,"A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that lacks the ability to invade neighboring tissue (spread throughout the body) or metastasize.
When removed, benign tumors usually do not grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do.
Benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate than malignant tumors and the tumor cells are usually more differentiated (cells have normal features).
Although benign tumors will not metastasize or locally invade tissues, some types may still produce negative health effects.
The growth of benign tumors produces a ""mass effect"" that can compress tissues and may cause nerve damage, reduction of blood to an area of the body (ischaemia), tissue death (necrosis) and organ damage.
Examples include thyroid adenomas and adrenocortical adenomas.Although most benign tumors are not life-threatening, many types of benign tumors have the potential to become cancerous (malignant) through a process known as tumor progression.
For this reason and other possible negative health effects, some benign tumors are removed by surgery.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_tumor,"[('Signs and symptoms',), ('Causes', 'PTEN hamartoma syndrome'), ('Causes', 'Familial adenomatous polyposis'), ('Causes', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex'), ('Causes', 'Von Hippel-Lindau disease'), ('Mechanism', 'Benign vs malignant'), ('Mechanism', 'Multistage carcinogenesis'), ('Diagnosis', 'Classification'), ('Treatment',), ('References',)]"
malnutrition,280,Malnutrition,"If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development.
The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking.Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat.
There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies.
Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A.
During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common.
Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery.Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid.
Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and efforts to promote the practice increase the rates of breastfeeding.

Complications can include abscess formation.Risk factors include poor latch, cracked nipples, use of a breast pump, and weaning. The bacteria most commonly involved are Staphylococcus and Streptococci. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms. Ultrasound may be useful for detecting a potential abscess.Prevention is by frequently and properly breastfeeding. When infection is present, antibiotics such as cephalexin may be recommended.

Some sources equate the term mole with ""melanocytic nevus"", but there are also sources that equate the term mole with any nevus form.The majority of moles appear during the first two decades of a person's life, with about one in every 100 babies being born with moles.
Acquired moles are a form of benign neoplasm, while congenital moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma.
A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte.
The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color.
Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi and can occur in all mammalian species especially humans, dogs, and horses.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocytic_nevus,"[('Signs and symptoms', 'Aging'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Complications'), ('Cause', 'Genetics'), ('Cause', 'Sunlight'), ('Cause', 'Hormones'), ('Diagnosis', 'Classification'), ('Diagnosis', 'Differentiation from melanoma'), ('Management', 'Mole removal risks'), ('History',), ('Society and culture', 'Face mole reading'), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

memory,266,Memory,"Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed.
Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.
Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor.
Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data.
Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information.
An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming phenomenon.

These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously.Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe.
Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur.
Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss.
In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, and they may still be able to form new memories.
However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed.
Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes.The term is from Ancient Greek, meaning 'forgetfulness'; from  ἀ- (a-), meaning 'without', and  μνήσις (mnesis), meaning 'memory'.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia,"[('Signs and symptoms', 'Declarative information'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Non-declarative information'), ('Causes',), ('Diagnosis', 'Types'), ('Treatment',), ('History', 'Henry Molaison'), ('History', 'Patient R.B.'), ('History', 'Patient G.D.'), ('In fiction',), ('See also',), ('References',)]"

Initial evaluation aims at figuring out pregnancy status, menopausal status, and the source of bleeding.
Treatment depends on the cause, severity, and interference with quality of life. Initial treatment often involve birth control pills.

One source recommends servicing intervals of: 3–5 years for watches, 15–20 years for grandfather clocks, 10–15 years for wall or mantel clocks, 15–20 years for anniversary clocks, and 7 years for cuckoo clocks, with the longer intervals applying to antique timepieces.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(clockwork),"[('Mechanical movements',), ('Types of movements',), ('Caliber',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"
movement disorders,315,Movement disorders,"Movement disorders are clinical syndromes with either an excess of movement or a paucity of voluntary and involuntary movements, unrelated to weakness or spasticity.  Movement disorders are synonymous with basal ganglia or extrapyramidal diseases.  Movement disorders are conventionally divided into two major categories- hyperkinetic and hypokinetic.
Hyperkinetic movement disorders refer to dyskinesia, or excessive, often repetitive, involuntary movements that intrude upon the normal flow of motor activity.
Hypokinetic movement disorders refer to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movements), bradykinesia (slow movement) and rigidity. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is a manifestation of another systemic or neurological disorder.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_disorders,"[('Classification',), ('Diagnosis',), ('Treatment',), ('History',), ('References',)]"
mucous body substance,492,Mucus,"It is a slippery aqueous secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes.
It is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands, although it may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells.
It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic salts, antimicrobial enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins, and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and mucins, which are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands.
Mucus serves to protect epithelial cells in the linings of the respiratory, digestive, and  urogenital systems, and structures in the visual, and auditory systems from pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses.
Most of the mucus in the body is produced in the gastrointestinal tract.
Amphibians, fish, hagfish, snails, slugs, and some other invertebrates also produce external mucus from their epidermis as protection against pathogens, and to help in movement.

muscle fatigue,472,Muscle fatigue,Muscle fatigue is the decline in ability of a muscle to generate force. It can be a result of vigorous exercise but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction.

muscle strength,376,Muscle,"Muscle cells contain protein filaments of actin and myosin  that slide past one another, producing a contraction that changes both the length and the shape of the cell.
There are three types of muscle, skeletal or striated, cardiac, and smooth.
Cardiac and smooth muscles contract without conscious thought and are termed involuntary, whereas the skeletal muscles contract upon command.
Skeletal muscles in turn can be divided into fast and slow twitch fibers.
Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates, but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers.
These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.The term muscle is derived from the Latin musculus meaning ""little mouse"" perhaps because of the shape of certain muscles or because contracting muscles look like mice moving under the skin.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle,"[('Structure', 'Types'), ('Structure', 'Microanatomy'), ('Structure', 'Gross anatomy'), ('Structure', 'Muscular system'), ('Structure', 'Development'), ('Physiology', 'Contraction'), ('Physiology', 'Nervous control', 'Muscle movement'), ('Physiology', 'Nervous control', 'Proprioception'), ('Physiology', 'Energy consumption', 'Efficiency'), ('Physiology', 'Strength', 'Physiological strength'), ('Physiology', 'Strength', 'The ""strongest"" human muscle'), ('Exercise',), ('Clinical significance', 'Hypertrophy'), ('Clinical significance', 'Atrophy'), ('Clinical significance', 'Disease'), ('Evolution',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

These muscle types may be activated both through interaction of the central nervous system as well as by receiving innervation from peripheral plexus or endocrine (hormonal) activation.
Striated or skeletal muscle only contracts voluntarily, upon influence of the central nervous system.
Reflexes are a form of nonconscious activation of skeletal muscles, but nonetheless arise through activation of the central nervous system, albeit not engaging cortical structures until after the contraction has occurred.The different muscle types vary in their response to neurotransmitters and endocrine substances such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, nitric oxide and among others depending on muscle type and the exact location of the muscle.Sub-categorization of muscle tissue is also possible, depending on among other things the content of myoglobin, mitochondria, myosin ATPase etc.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tissue,"[('Structure', 'Comparison of types'), ('Structure', 'Skeletal muscle'), ('Structure', 'Smooth muscle'), ('Structure', 'Cardiac muscle'), ('Function', 'Smooth muscle'), ('Function', 'Cardiac muscle'), ('See also',)]"
muscle weakness,526,Muscle weakness,"Muscle weakness is a lack of muscle strength. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have either true or perceived muscle weakness.  True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. Muscle weakness can also be caused by low levels of potassium and other electrolytes within muscle cells. It can be temporary or long-lasting (from seconds or minutes to months or years).

Arm, leg and respiratory muscles are generally affected first.
SMA is a leading genetic cause of death in infants.Spinal muscular atrophy is due to a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene.
The SMN1 gene encodes SMN, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons.
Loss of these neurons prevents the sending of signals between the brain and skeletal muscles.
Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.Treatments include supportive care such as physical therapy, nutrition support, and mechanical ventilation.

The latter resemble stabbings or electric shocks. Common qualities  include burning or coldness, ""pins and needles"" sensations, numbness and itching.
Up to 7%-8% of the European population is affected, and in 5% of persons it may be severe.
Neuropathic pain may result from disorders of the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).

nervousness,119,Nervous system,"The nervous system is a highly complex part of an animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body.
The PNS consists mainly of nerves, which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons, that connect the CNS to every other part of the body.
Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves, while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent.
The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems, the somatic,  autonomic, and  enteric nervous systems.
Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily.
At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a ""nerve cell"".

In X-linked congenital stationary night blindness, from birth the rods either do not work at all, or work very little, but the condition doesn't get worse.
Since the outer area of the retina is made up of more rods than cones, loss of peripheral vision often results in night blindness.

There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the central nervous system such as a temporary decrease in the metabolic activity of large parts of the cerebral cortex while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the limbic (i.e., ""bordering"") areas of the brain.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm,"[('Definitions',), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Males', 'Variabilities'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Males', 'Two-stage model'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Males', 'Subsequent and multiple orgasms'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Females', 'Orgasmic factors and variabilities'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Females', 'Clitoral and vaginal categories'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Females', 'Clitoral and vaginal relationships'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Females', 'Other factors and research'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Females', 'Exercise-induced'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Anal and prostate stimulation'), ('Achieving orgasm', 'Nipple stimulation'), ('Medical aspects', 'Physiological responses', 'Males'), ('Medical aspects', 'Physiological responses', 'Females'), ('Medical aspects', 'Brain'), ('Medical aspects', 'Health', 'General'), ('Medical aspects', 'Health', 'Dysfunction and satisfaction'), ('Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm', 'Shifts in research'), ('Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm', 'Selective pressure and mating'), ('Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm', 'Fertility'), ('Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm', 'Adaptive or vestigial'), ('Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm', 'Other theories'), ('Involuntary orgasm',), ('Tantric sex',), ('Literature',), ('Other animals',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"
osteogenesis imperfecta,239,Osteogenesis imperfecta,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones.

These genetic problems are often inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur via a new mutation.
There are at least eight main types, with type I being the least severe and type II the most severe.
Treatment may include care of broken bones, pain medication, physical therapy, braces or wheelchairs and surgery.
A type of surgery that puts metal rods through long bones may be done to strengthen them.
Tentative evidence supports the use of medications of the bisphosphonate type.OI affects about one in 15,000 people.

Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity.
Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which  releases heat.
The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves.

The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there, which draws air into the lungs.The term diaphragm in anatomy, created by Gerard of Cremona,  can refer to other flat structures such as the urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm, but ""the diaphragm"" generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm.
There is also a theory that the diaphragm is lower on  the other side due to the presence of the heart.

From the larynx, air moves into the trachea and down to the intersection known as the carina that branches to form the right and left primary (main) bronchi.
At the base of the lungs is a sheet of skeletal muscle called the diaphragm.

Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection of the skin.Scabies is caused by infection with the female mite Sarcoptes scabiei var.
Scabies is most often spread during a relatively long period of direct skin contact with an infected person (at least 10 minutes) such as that which may occur during sex or living together.
Spread of disease may occur even if the person has not developed symptoms yet.
As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed.
If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.Scabies is one of the three most common skin disorders in children, along with ringworm and bacterial skin infections.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabies,"[('Signs and symptoms', 'Itching'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Rash'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Crusted scabies'), ('Cause', 'Scabies mite'), ('Cause', 'Transmission'), ('Pathophysiology',), ('Diagnosis', 'Differential diagnosis'), ('Prevention',), ('Management', 'Permethrin'), ('Management', 'Ivermectin'), ('Management', 'Others'), ('Management', 'Communities'), ('Epidemiology',), ('History',), ('Society and culture',), ('Other animals',), ('Research',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

shivering,788,Shivering,"Shivering (also called shuddering) is a bodily function in response to cold in humans and other warm-blooded animals.
When the core body temperature drops, the shivering reflex is triggered to maintain homeostasis.
Shivering can also be a response to a fever, as a person may feel cold.
The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold until the new set point is reached.
Rigors occur because the patient's body is shivering in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point.
Increased muscular activity results in the generation of heat as a byproduct.
Most often, when the purpose of the muscle activity is to produce motion, the heat is wasted energy.
In shivering, the heat is the main intended product and is utilized for warmth.

Sideroblasts (sidero- + -blast) are nucleated erythroblasts (precursors to mature red blood cells) with granules of iron accumulated in the mitochondria surrounding the nucleus.
Normally, sideroblasts are present in the bone marrow, and enter the circulation after maturing into a normal erythrocyte.
Only the finding of ring (or ringed) sideroblasts characterizes sideroblastic anemia.

Skin wrinkles typically appear as a result of aging processes such as glycation,  habitual sleeping positions, loss of body mass, sun damage, or temporarily, as the result of prolonged immersion in water. Age wrinkling in the skin is promoted by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors. In humans, it can also be prevented to some degree by avoiding excessive solar exposure and through diet (in particular through consumption of carotenoids, tocophenols and flavonoids, vitamins (A, C, D and E), essential omega-3-fatty acids, certain proteins and lactobacilli.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle,"[('Skin', 'Causes for aging wrinkles'), ('Skin', 'Sleep wrinkles'), ('Skin', 'Water-immersion wrinkling'), ('Skin', 'Animals with wrinkles'), ('Skin', 'Treatments for aging wrinkles'), ('Other surfaces',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"
sleep,383,Sleep,"Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings.
It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying very different and active brain patterns.
Although REM stands for ""rapid eye movement"", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body.
A well-known feature of sleep is the dream, an experience typically recounted in narrative form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy.

Dilated blood vessels can also develop on the legs, although when they occur on the legs, they often have underlying venous reflux or ""hidden varicose veins"" (see ""venous hypertension"" section below).
Many patients who suffer with spider veins seek the assistance of physicians who specialize in vein care or peripheral vascular disease.
These physicians are called vascular surgeons or phlebologists.

It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from the interior of the nose.
Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below).
Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it).

It performs a chemical breakdown due to enzymes and hydrochloric acid.
In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine. It secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion.

Historically, it was widely believed that the highly acidic environment of the stomach would keep the stomach immune from infection.
However, many studies have indicated that most cases of stomach ulcers, gastritis, and stomach cancer are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection.
One of the ways it is able to survive in the stomach involves its urease enzymes which metabolize urea (which is normally secreted into the stomach) to ammonia and carbon dioxide which neutralises gastric acid and thus prevents its digestion.

suppuration,764,Pus,"Pus is an exudate, typically white-yellow, yellow, or yellow-brown, formed at the site of inflammation during bacterial or fungal infection.
Pus consists of a thin, protein-rich fluid, historically known as liquor puris, and dead leukocytes from the body's immune response (mostly neutrophils).
During infection, macrophages  release cytokines  which trigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection by chemotaxis.
There, the neutrophils release granules which destroy the bacteria.
The bacteria resist the immune response by releasing toxins called leukocidins.
As the neutrophils die off from toxins and old age, they are destroyed by macrophages, forming the viscous pus.
Bacteria that cause pus are called pyogenic.Although pus is normally of a whitish-yellow hue, changes in the color can be observed under certain circumstances.

sweat,57,Sweetness,"Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars.
In addition to sugars like sucrose, many other chemical compounds are sweet, including aldehydes, ketones, and sugar alcohols.
Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric sugar substitutes.
The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.The chemosensory basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century.
Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution.
In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density, while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity.
The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient evolutionary heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness,"[('Examples of sweet substances',), ('Sweetness modifiers',), ('The sweetness receptor',), ('Sweet receptor pathway',), ('Cognition',), ('Historical theories',), ('MPA theory',), ('References', 'Cited')]"
sweating,58,Perspiration,"Perspiration, also known as sweating, is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals.Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands.
The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body.
In humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation, which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands.
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling.

Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx.

syndrome,384,Syndrome,"A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms and collection of diseases which are not correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder.
In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them.
For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature.
By definition, an association indicates that the collection of signs and symptoms occurs in combination more frequently than would be likely by chance alone.Syndromes are often named after the physician or group of physicians that discovered them or initially described the full clinical picture.
Such eponymous syndrome names are examples of medical eponyms.

syphilis,615,Syphilis,"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.
The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary).
The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration usually between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter) though there may be multiple sores.
Syphilis has been known as ""the great imitator"" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity.
Other diseases caused by the Treponema bacteria include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and nonvenereal endemic syphilis (subspecies endemicum).

Treatment includes stopping the neuroleptic medication if possible or switching to clozapine.
Other medications such as valbenazine, tetrabenazine, or botulinum toxin may be used to lessen the symptoms.
With treatment some see a resolution of symptoms while others do not.Rates in those on atypical antipsychotics are about 20%, while those on typical antipsychotics have rates of about 30%.

The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back.
The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus on the tongue's surface.
There are two groups of muscles of the tongue.

The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans.
In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary, and reproductive tracts.
To accommodate smoother penetration of the vagina during sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, vaginal moisture increases during sexual arousal in human females and other female mammals.

Genital warts are often sexually transmitted.Without treatment, most types of warts resolve in months to years.
A number of treatments may speed resolution including salicylic acid applied to the skin and cryotherapy.
In those who are otherwise healthy, they do not typically result in significant problems.
Treatment of genital warts differs from that of other types.Warts are very common, with most people being infected at some point in their lives.
The estimated current rate of non-genital warts among the general population is 1–13%.
The estimated rate of genital warts in sexually active women is 12%.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart,"[('Types',), ('Cause',), ('Pathophysiology',), ('Diagnosis',), ('Prevention', 'Disinfection'), ('Treatment', 'Medication'), ('Treatment', 'Procedures'), ('Society and culture',), ('Other animals',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"
weight decreased,111,Weight loss,"Weight loss, in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness, refers to a reduction of the total body mass, due to a mean loss of fluid, body fat or adipose tissue or lean mass, namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue. Weight loss can either occur unintentionally due to malnourishment or an underlying disease or arise from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state.  ""Unexplained"" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Intentional weight loss is commonly referred to as slimming.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss,"[('Intentional', 'Techniques'), ('Intentional', 'Long-term weight loss'), ('Intentional', 'Weight loss industry'), ('Unintentional', 'Characteristics'), ('Unintentional', 'Causes', 'Disease-related'), ('Unintentional', 'Causes', 'Therapy-related'), ('Unintentional', 'Causes', 'Social conditions'), ('Myths',), ('Health effects',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"
wernicke-korsakoff syndrome,652,Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome,"Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is the combined presence of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. Due to the close relationship between these two disorders, people with either are usually diagnosed with WKS as a single syndrome. 
The cause of the disorder is thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which can cause a range of disorders including beriberi,  Wernicke encephalopathy, and alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome. These disorders may manifest together or separately. WKS is usually secondary to alcohol abuse. It mainly causes vision changes, ataxia and impaired memory.Wernicke encephalopathy and WKS are most commonly seen in people who are alcoholic. Failure in diagnosis of WE and thus treatment of the disease leads to death in approximately 20% of cases, while 75% are left with permanent brain damage associated with WKS.  Of those affected, 25% require long-term institutionalization in order to receive effective care.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%E2%80%93Korsakoff_syndrome,"[('Signs and symptoms', 'Wernicke encephalopathy'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Cognitive effects'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Memory deficits'), ('Signs and symptoms', 'Confabulation'), ('Causes', 'Post-gastrectomy'), ('Causes', 'Alcohol–thiamine interactions'), ('Pathophysiology',), ('Diagnosis',), ('Prevention',), ('Treatment',), ('Epidemiology',), ('History', 'Wernicke encephalopathy'), ('History', 'Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome'), ('Society and culture',), ('See also',), ('References',)]"
wheezing,730,Wheeze,"A wheeze is a continuous, coarse, whistling sound produced in the respiratory airways during breathing. For wheezes to occur, some part of the respiratory tree must be narrowed or obstructed (for example narrowing of the lower respiratory tract in an asthmatic attack), or airflow velocity within the respiratory tree must be heightened. Wheezing is commonly experienced by persons with a lung disease; the most common cause of recurrent wheezing is asthma attacks, though it can also be a symptom of lung cancer, congestive heart failure, and certain types of heart diseases.
The differential diagnosis of wheezing is wide, and the reason for  wheezing in a given patient is determined by considering the characteristics of the wheezes and the historical and clinical findings made by the examining physician.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeze,"[('Characteristics', 'Wheeze'), ('Characteristics', 'Stridor'), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"
withdrawal symptoms,399,Drug withdrawal,"Drug withdrawal is the group of symptoms that occur upon the abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake of medications or recreational drugs.
In order for the symptoms of withdrawal to occur, one must have first developed a form of drug dependence.
Dependence arises in a dose-dependent manner and produces withdrawal symptoms that vary with the type of drug that is consumed.
Withdrawal symptoms from opiates include anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Alcohol withdrawal symptoms include irritability, fatigue, shaking, sweating, and nausea.
Many prescription and legal nonprescription substances can also cause withdrawal symptoms when individuals stop consuming them, even if they were taken as directed by a physician.
The symptoms from withdrawal may be even more dramatic when the drug has masked prolonged malnutrition, disease, chronic pain, infections (common in intravenous drug use), or sleep deprivation, conditions that drug abusers often suffer as a secondary consequence of the drug.
When the drug is removed, these conditions may resurface and be confused with withdrawal symptoms.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_withdrawal,"[('Effect on homeostasis',), ('Substances',), ('Prescription medicine',), ('See also',), ('References',)]"
wound healing,10,Wound healing,"Wound healing is a complex process in which the skin, and the tissues under it, repair themselves after injury.
In this article, wound healing is depicted in a discrete timeline of physical attributes (phases) constituting the post-trauma repairing process.
In undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface layer) and dermis (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment.
This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation).
Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.
The wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds.
Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound_healing,"[('Stages',), ('Timing and reepithelialization',), ('Early vs cellular phase',), ('Inflammatory phase', 'Clotting cascade'), ('Inflammatory phase', 'Vasoconstriction and vasodilation'), ('Inflammatory phase', 'Polymorphonuclear neutrophils'), ('Inflammatory phase', 'Macrophages'), ('Inflammatory phase', 'Decline of inflammatory phase'), ('Proliferative phase', 'Angiogenesis'), ('Proliferative phase', 'Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation', 'Collagen deposition'), ('Proliferative phase', 'Epithelialization'), ('Proliferative phase', 'Contraction'), ('Maturation and remodeling',), ('Factors affecting wound healing', 'Local factors'), ('Factors affecting wound healing', 'Systemic factors'), ('Research and development', 'Stem cells and cellular plasticity'), ('Research and development', 'Wound repair versus regeneration'), ('Research and development', 'Scarless wound healing'), ('Research and development', 'Cancer'), ('Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective',), ('Wound closure intentions', 'Primary intention'), ('Wound closure intentions', 'Secondary intention'), ('Wound closure intentions', 'Tertiary intention'), ('Overview of involved growth factors',), ('Complications of wound healing',), ('Biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds',), ('See also',), ('Notes and references',)]"
wounds and injuries,535,Major trauma,"Major trauma is any injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. There are many causes of major trauma, blunt and penetrating, including falls, motor vehicle collisions, stabbing wounds, and gunshot wounds. Depending on the severity of injury, quickness of management and transportation to an appropriate medical facility (called a trauma center) may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb. The initial assessment is critical, and involves a physical evaluation and also may include the use of imaging tools to determine the types of injuries accurately and to formulate a course of treatment.
In 2002, unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide, accounting for 6.23% and 2.84% of all deaths. For research purposes the definition often is based on an injury severity score (ISS) of greater than 15.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_trauma,"[('Classification',), ('Causes',), ('Pathophysiology',), ('Diagnosis', 'Physical examination'), ('Diagnosis', 'Imaging'), ('Diagnosis', 'Surgical techniques'), ('Prevention',), ('Management', 'Pre-hospital'), ('Management', 'In-hospital'), ('Management', 'Intravenous fluids'), ('Management', 'Medications'), ('Management', 'Surgery'), ('Prognosis',), ('Epidemiology',), ('History',), ('Society and culture', 'Economics'), ('Society and culture', 'Low- and middle-income countries'), ('Special populations', 'Children'), ('Special populations', 'Pregnancy'), ('Research',), ('References',), ('Bibliography',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"
xerostomia,27,Xerostomia,"Xerostomia, also known as dry mouth, is dryness in the mouth, which may be associated with a change in the composition of saliva, or reduced salivary flow, or have no identifiable cause.
This symptom is very common and is often seen as a side effect of many types of medication. It is more common in older people (mostly because this group tend to take several medications) and in persons who breathe through their mouths. Dehydration, radiotherapy involving the salivary glands, chemotherapy and several diseases can cause reduced salivation (hyposalivation), or a change in saliva consistency and hence a complaint of xerostomia.

yang deficiency,701,Yin and yang,"In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives.
Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology.
In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as qi.
Many natural dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water, expanding and contracting, and booling and cranking) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang,"[('Linguistic aspects', 'Characters'), ('Linguistic aspects', 'Pronunciations and etymologies'), ('Linguistic aspects', 'Meanings'), ('Linguistic aspects', 'Toponymy'), ('Linguistic aspects', 'Loanwords'), ('History', 'Chinese gender roles'), ('Nature',), ('Symbolism and importance', 'I Ching'), ('Symbolism and importance', 'Taijitu'), ('Symbolism and importance', 'Taijiquan'), ('See also',), ('References', 'Footnotes'), ('References', 'Works cited'), ('External links',)]"
