Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.
High doses may result in ringing in the ears.A precursor to aspirin found in leaves from the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years.
In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time.
In 1897, scientists at the Bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines.

Evidence shows that they reduce the risk of fracture in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.Bone tissue undergoes constant remodeling and is kept in balance (homeostasis) by osteoblasts creating bone and osteoclasts destroying bone. Bisphosphonates inhibit the digestion of bone by encouraging osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis, or cell death, thereby slowing bone loss.The uses of bisphosphonates include the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, bone metastasis (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma, primary hyperparathyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, and other conditions that exhibit bone fragility.

Its distribution extends from Great Britain in the west to western Ukraine and the Iranian province of Gilan in the east.
These tropane alkaloids appear to be common in the family Solanaceae, as they are also present in plants of the genera Brugmansia, Datura and Hyoscyamus, of the same family but in different subfamilies and tribes than the nightshade.
Atropa belladonna has unpredictable effects.
The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.It has a long history of use as a medicine, cosmetic, and poison.
The name belladonna is derived from Italian for ""beautiful woman"", as during the Renaissance, the herb was used in eyedrops by women to dilate the pupils of the eyes to make them appear seductive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropa_belladonna,"[('Description',), ('Distribution',), ('Cultivation',), ('Taxonomy',), ('Etymology',), ('Toxicity',), ('Legal status',), ('Uses', 'Cosmetics'), ('Uses', 'Dietary supplements'), ('Uses', 'Medicinal uses', 'Alternative medicine and toxicity risk'), ('Uses', 'Recreational drug'), ('Uses', 'Poison'), ('Folklore', 'Flying ointment'), ('Folklore', 'Female attractiveness'), ('Gallery',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('External links',)]"

Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.
To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet.
Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium.

The several classes of antihypertensives differ in side effect profiles, ability to prevent endpoints, and cost.
As of 2018, the best available evidence favors low-dose thiazide diuretics as the first-line treatment of choice for high blood pressure when drugs are necessary.

More than 50,000 distinct CYP proteins are known.CYPs are, in general, the terminal oxidase enzymes in electron transfer chains, broadly categorized as P450-containing systems.
The term ""P450"" is derived from the spectrophotometric peak at the wavelength of the absorption maximum of the enzyme (450 nm) when it is in the reduced state and complexed with carbon monoxide.
Most CYPs require a protein partner to deliver one or more electrons to reduce the iron (and eventually molecular oxygen).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450,"[('Nomenclature',), ('Classification',), ('Mechanism', 'Structure'), ('Mechanism', 'Catalytic cycle'), ('Mechanism', 'Spectroscopy'), ('P450s in humans', 'Drug metabolism', 'Drug interaction'), ('P450s in humans', 'Drug metabolism', 'Interaction of other substances'), ('P450s in humans', 'Other specific CYP functions', 'Steroid hormones'), ('P450s in humans', 'Other specific CYP functions', 'Polyunsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids'), ('P450s in humans', 'CYP families in humans'), ('P450s in other species', 'Animals'), ('P450s in other species', 'Microbial'), ('P450s in other species', 'Fungi'), ('P450s in other species', 'Plants'), ('P450s in biotechnology',), ('InterPro subfamilies',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"

While CYP2E1 itself carries out a relatively low number of these reactions (~4% of known P450-mediated drug oxidations), it and related enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are responsible for the breakdown of many toxic environmental chemicals and carcinogens that enter the body, in addition to basic metabolic reactions such as fatty acid oxidations.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1,"[('Function', 'Substrates'), ('Structure',), ('Regulation', 'Genetic regulation'), ('Regulation', 'Chemical regulation'), ('Disease relevance',), ('Applications',), ('See also',), ('References',), ('Further reading',), ('External links',)]"

It is also a precursor molecule for all steroid hormones and vitamin D.
Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acid and vitamin D. Cholesterol is the principal sterol synthesized by all animals. In vertebrates, hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth.François Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769.

tuberculosis vaccine,156,Tuberculosis vaccines,"Tuberculosis (TB) vaccines are vaccinations intended for the prevention of tuberculosis.   Immunotherapy as a defence against TB was first proposed in 1890 by Robert Koch. Today, the only effective tuberculosis vaccine in common use is bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG), first used in 1921. About three out of every 10,000 people who get the vaccine experience side effects, which are usually minor except in severely immuno-depressed individuals. While BCG immunization provides fairly effective protection for infants and young children, (including defence against TB meningitis and miliary TB), its efficacy in adults is variable, ranging from 0% to 80%. Several variables have been considered as responsible for the varying outcomes.  Demand for TB immunotherapy advancement exists because the disease has become increasingly drug-resistant.Other tuberculosis vaccines are at various stages of development, including:

The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal.
All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached, called a retinyl group.
Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity.
