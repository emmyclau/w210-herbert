5-HTP,5-HTP,"5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also known as oxitriptan, is a naturally occurring amino acid and chemical precursor as well as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin.
In humans 5-HTP has never been clinically associated with serotonin syndrome, although a case report suggests 5-HTP can precipitate mania when added to an MAOI.When combined with carbidopa (as a treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron.
in 2007, which observed that MDMA-induced depletions of 5-HT (serotonin) were restored in rats after administration of 5-HTP, and suggested that this approach might be clinically useful in abstinent MDMA users.At high doses, or in combination with carbidopa, it has been used off-label to treat obesity (by promoting weight loss).In clinical trials of various design, 5-HTP has also been reported to treat fibromyalgia, myoclonus, migraine, and cerebellar ataxia."
Activated Charcoal,Activated Charcoal,"The adsorption of reactant/s to the catalyst surface creates a chemical bond, altering the electron density around the reactant molecule and allowing it to undergo reactions that would not normally be available to it.One major industrial application involves use of activated carbon in metal finishing for purification of electroplating solutions.
Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon is used to treat poisonings and overdoses following oral ingestion."
Alfalfa,Alfalfa,"It is known that members of this species pollinate up to 65 different species of plants, and it is the primary pollinator of key dietary crops, such as cranberries, plums, apples, onions, and alfalfa.M. rotundata was unintentionally introduced into the United States during the 1940s, and its management as a pollinator of alfalfa has led to a three-fold increase in seed production in the U.S. The synchronous emergence of the adult bees of this species during alfalfa blooming period in combination with such behaviors as gregarious nesting, and utilization of leaves and nesting materials that have been mass-produced by humans provide positive benefits for the use of these bees in pollinating alfalfa.Alfalfa is considered an insectary, a place where insects are reared, and has been proposed as helpful to other crops, such as cotton, if the two are interplanted, because the alfalfa harbours predatory and parasitic insects that would protect the other crop."
American Ginseng,American Ginseng,"States recognizing American ginseng as a special concern: Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Tennessee.American ginseng was formerly particularly widespread in the Appalachian and Ozark regions (and adjacent forested regions such as Pennsylvania, New York and Ontario).
Due to its popularity and unique habitat requirements, the wild plant has been overharvested, as well as lost through destruction of its habitat, and is thus rare in most parts of the United States and Canada.
Woods-grown American ginseng programs in Vermont, Maine, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, West Virginia, and Kentucky, have been encouraging the planting of ginseng both to restore natural habitats and to remove pressure from any remaining wild ginseng.Individuals requiring anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin should avoid use of ginseng.
There is tentative evidence that it may lessen the length of sickness when used preventively.Cold-fX is a product derived from the roots of North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius)."

Ashwagandha,Ashwagandha,"Withania somnifera, known commonly as ashwagandha, Indian ginseng, poison gooseberry, or winter cherry is a plant in the Solanaceae or nightshade family.
Although commonly used as a medicinal herb in Ayurvedic medicine, there is no conclusive clinical evidence that it is effective for treating any ailment.Withania somnifera is cultivated in many of the drier regions of India.
The apical leaves are shed and the plant gradually dies.
somnifera, ""Indian ginseng"".The plant, particularly its root powder, has been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine.
Mainly due to the poor quality of clinical research with the plant, there is no high-quality evidence that it provides any medicinal benefit and may cause adverse effects if taken together with prescription drugs.
Dietary supplements containing ashwagandha are marketed in the U.S., but there is no evidence they have any effect.The species name somnifera means ""sleep-inducing"" in Latin."
Bacillus Coagulans,Bacillus Coagulans,"Bacillus coagulans is a lactic acid-forming bacterial species.
DNA-based technology was used in distinguishing between the two genera of bacteria which are morphologically similar and possess similar physiological and biochemical characteristics.B. coagulans is a Gram-positive rod (0.9 by 3.0 to 5.0 μm in size), catalase positive, spore-forming, motile, and a facultative anaerobe.
VP and MR (methyl-red) tests are positive.Bacillus coagulans has been added by the EFSA to their Qualified Presumption of Safety list and has been approved for veterinary purposes as GRAS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, as well as by the European Union, and is listed by AAFCO for use as a direct-fed microbial in livestock production.
coagulans  is often marketed as Lactobacillus sporogenes or a 'sporeforming lactic acid bacterium' probiotic, but this is an outdated name due to taxonomic changes in 1939.
By definition, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) do not form spores."
Bee Pollen,Bee Pollen,"Bee pollen is a ball or pellet of field-gathered flower pollen packed by worker honeybees, and used as the primary food source for the hive.
Also called bee bread, or ambrosia, it is stored in brood cells, mixed with saliva, and sealed with a drop of honey.
The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the use of some bee pollen products because they are adulterated with unapproved drugs including sibutramine and phenolphthalein.In honeybees (Apis species) pollen is stored in the chambers of the hives.
The foragers unload the pollen they gather directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called bee bread – the substance which is the main food source for honey bee larvae and workers.
Foraging bees bring pollen back to the hive, where they pass it off to other worker bees, who pack the pollen into cells with their heads."
Belladonna,Belladonna,"There is insufficient scientific evidence justifying the use of belladonna for these or any other clinical disorders.In 2010 and 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration warned consumers against the use of homeopathic teething tablets and gels containing belladonna as used for infants and children, stating that the products may be toxic, causing ""seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargy, excessive sleepiness, muscle weakness, skin flushing, constipation, difficulty urinating, or agitation"".Among the ancient folk traditions of the Romanian (Moldavian) / Ukrainian region of Bukovina in the Carpathians is the ritual for a Bukovinian girl to enhance her attractiveness by making an offering to deadly nightshade.
The common names for this species include belladonna, deadly nightshade, divale, dwale, banewort, devil's berries, death cherries, beautiful death, devil's herb, great morel, and dwayberry.Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found, and its use by mouth increases risk in numerous clinical conditions, such as complications of pregnancy, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders, among others."
Berberine,Berberine,"Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids found in such plants as Berberis (e.g. Berberis vulgaris – barberry, Berberis aristata – tree turmeric, Mahonia aquifolium – Oregon-grape, Hydrastis canadensis – goldenseal, Xanthorhiza simplicissima – yellowroot, Phellodendron amurense – Amur cork tree, Coptis chinensis – Chinese goldthread, Tinospora cordifolia, Argemone mexicana – prickly poppy, and Eschscholzia californica – Californian poppy).
As a natural dye, berberine has a color index of 75160.The alkaloid berberine has a tetracyclic skeleton derived from a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline system with the incorporation of an extra carbon atom provided by S-adenosyl methionine via an N-methyl group.
Formation of the berberine bridge is readily rationalized as an oxidative process in which the N-methyl group is oxidized to an iminium ion, and a cyclization to the aromatic ring occurs by virtue of the phenolic group.Reticuline is known as the immediate precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants."
Beta-Carotene,Beta-Carotene,"RAE takes into account carotenoids' variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans better than and replaces the older retinol equivalent (RE) (1 µg RE = 1 µg retinol, 6 µg β-carotene, or 12 µg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin).
Unfortunately, food and supplement labels still generally use IU, but IU can be converted to the more useful retinol activity equivalent as follows:Sunless tanning with beta-carotene
Therefore, β-carotene is considered a safe source of vitamin A and high intakes will not lead to hypervitaminosis A.USDA Webpage on β-carotene Content of Gac – Fatty Acids and Carotenoids in Gac (Momordica Cochinchinensis Spreng) Fruit.Chronic high doses of β-carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers."
Bifidobacteria,Bifidobacteria,"Different species and/or strains of bifidobacteria may exert a range of beneficial health effects, including the regulation of intestinal microbial homeostasis, the inhibition of pathogens and harmful bacteria that colonize and/or infect the gut mucosa, the modulation of local and systemic immune responses, the repression of procarcinogenic enzymatic activities within the microbiota, the production of vitamins, and the bioconversion of a number of dietary compounds into bioactive molecules.
Therefore, when mother's milk is fermented by lactic acid bacteria (including bifidobacteria) in the infant's gastrointestinal tract, the pH may be reduced, making it more difficult for Gram-negative bacteria to grow.Members of the genus Bifidobacterium have genome sizes ranging from 1.73 (Bifidobacterium indicum) to 3.25 Mb (Bifidobacterium biavatii), corresponding to 1,352 and 2,557 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames, respectively.Functional classification of Bifidobacterium genes, including the pan-genome of this genus, revealed that 13.7% of the identified bifidobacterial genes encode enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.In 1899, Henri Tissier, a French pediatrician at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, isolated a bacterium characterised by a Y-shaped morphology (""bifid"") in the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants and named it ""bifidus""."
Biotin,Biotin,"To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of ≈10−8 M, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.The frequency of marginal biotin status is not known, but the incidence of low circulating biotin levels in alcoholics has been found to be much greater than in the general population.
Whether an organism has an enzyme with that ability will determine the bioavailability of biotin from the foodstuff.The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs), Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for many vitamins in 1998.
Until 2005, very harsh conditions were thought to be required to break the biotin-streptavidin interaction.Biotin is an important component of enzymes involved in metabolizing fats and carbohydrates, influencing cell growth, and affecting amino acids involved in protein synthesis."
Bitter Melon,Bitter Melon,"Also commonly seen is kattu pagarkkai, a curry in which bitter melons are stuffed with onions, cooked lentil and grated coconut mix, then tied with thread and fried in oil.
In Indonesian cuisine, bitter melon, known as pare in Javanese and Indonesian (also paria), is prepared in various dishes, such as gado-gado, and also stir-fried, cooked in coconut milk, or steamed.
In Thai cuisine, the Chinese variety of green bitter melon, mara (มะระ) in Thai, is prepared stuffed with minced pork and garlic, in a clear broth.
For cancer prevention, HIV and AIDS, and treatment of infections, there is preliminary laboratory research, but no clinical studies in humans showing a benefit.With regard to the use of Momordica charantia for diabetes, several animal studies and small-scale human studies have demonstrated a hypoglycemic effect of concentrated bitter melon extracts."
Black Psyllium,Black Psyllium,"Psyllium , or ispaghula (isabgol)  , is the common name used for several members of the plant genus Plantago whose seeds are used commercially for the production of mucilage.
Use of psyllium for a month or longer produces a small reduction in systolic blood pressure.The plants from which the seeds are extracted tolerate dry and cool climates and are mainly cultivated in northern India.The genus Plantago contains over 200 species.
Seed stored for future crops has shown a significant loss in viability after 2 years in storage.USDA Plants Profile: Plantago ovata Forsk.
In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a health claim for dietary psyllium as a soluble fiber that would reduce the risk of heart disease.
What was proven in clinical trials was that seven grams or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk would sufficiently lower total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia, accepted biomarkers for risk for coronary heart disease."
Black Tea,Black Tea,"Fannings and dusts usually have a darker colour, lack of sweetness, and stronger flavor when brewed.Generally, unblended black teas are named after the region in which they are produced.
The rotorvane can consistently duplicate broken orthodox processed black tea of even sized broken leaves, however it cannot produce whole leaf black tea.
The broken leaves and particles from the orthodox method can feed into the CTC method for further processing into fanning or dust grade teas.
Since oxidation begins at the rolling stage itself, the time between these stages is also a crucial factor in the quality of the tea; however, fast processing of the tea leaves through continuous methods can effectively make this a separate step.
Unlike green teas, which turn bitter when brewed at higher temperatures, black tea should be steeped in water brought up to 90–95 °C."
Blessed Thistle,Blessed Thistle,"This fairly typical thistle has red to purple flowers and shiny pale green leaves with white veins.
Originally a native of Southern Europe through to Asia, it is now found throughout the world.Traditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin.
Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is a thorny plant presenting decorative leaves with a white pattern of veins and purple flower heads.
The spiny bracts on the flower head were eaten in the past like globe artichoke, and the stems (after peeling) can be soaked overnight to remove bitterness and then stewed.
The achenes are black, with a simple long white pappus, surrounded by a yellow basal ring.Milk thistle has been used for a number of purposes including treatment of liver disease, prevention and treatment of cancer, and supportive treatment of poisoning from death cap mushrooms; however, clinical study results were described as heterogeneous and contradictory.
A 2007 Cochrane Review included eighteen randomized clinical trials which assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases."
Blond Psyllium,Blond Psyllium,"Plantago ovata, known by many common names including blond plantain, desert Indianwheat, blond psyllium, and ispaghul, is a medicinal plant native to Western Asia and Southern Asia. The plant can be found growing wild in the southwestern United States, where it is considered a possibly  introduced species.It is a common source of psyllium, a type of dietary fiber. Psyllium seed husks are indigestible and are a source of soluble fiber which may be fermented into butyrate – a pharmacologically active short-chain fatty acid – by butyrate-producing bacteria..Plants For A Future: Plantago ovata

Blue-Green Algae,Blue-Green Algae,"By producing and releasing oxygen (as a byproduct of photosynthesis), cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early oxygen-poor, reducing atmosphere into an oxidizing one, causing the Great Oxygenation Event and the ""rusting of the Earth"", which dramatically changed the composition of the Earth's life forms and led to the near-extinction of anaerobic organisms.There are several features which are unique to the group of cyanobacteria.
This could potentially meet US demands for ethanol in gasoline in 2025, assuming a B30 blend, from an area of around half the size of California's San Bernardino County, requiring less than one-tenth of the area than ethanol from other biomass, such as corn, and only very limited amounts of fresh water.Cyanobacteria may possess the ability to produce substances that could one day serve as anti-inflammatory agents and combat bacterial infections in humans.Spirulina's extracted blue color is used as a natural food coloring in gum and candy.Researchers from several space agencies argue that cyanobacteria could be used for producing goods for human consumption in future manned outposts on Mars, by transforming materials available on this planet.Historically, bacteria were first classified as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, which along with the Schizophyceae (blue-green algae/Cyanobacteria) formed the phylum Schizophyta, then in the phylum Monera in the kingdom Protista by Haeckel in 1866, comprising Protogens, Protamaeba, Vampyrella, Protomonae, and Vibrio, but not Nostoc and other cyanobacteria, which were classified with algae,"
Blueberry,Blueberry,"Commercial ""blueberries"" – including both wild ('lowbush') and cultivated ('highbush') blueberries – are all native to North America.
In 2016, Canada was the largest producer of wild blueberries, mainly in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, but the production effort for wild blueberries was changing in 2017 to the more profitable cultivated highbush blueberries.In the Southern Hemisphere, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia grow blueberries commercially.
Every year the town hosts a large festival that draws thousands of people to celebrate the fruit.Resulting from cultivation of both lowbush (wild) and highbush blueberries, Maine accounts for 10% of all blueberries grown in North America with 44,000 hectares (110,000 acres) farmed, but only half of this acreage is harvested each year due to variations in pruning practices.
Other sections in the genus, native to other parts of the world, including the Pacific Northwest and southern United States, South America, Europe, and Asia, include other wild shrubs producing similar-looking edible berries, such as huckleberries and whortleberries (North America) and bilberries (Europe)."
Boron,Boron,"Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or Czochralski processes.The production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare.
The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.
Similarly, AlMgB14 + TiB2 composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt)."
Calendula,Calendula,"Calendula (),  is a genus of about 15–20 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the daisy family Asteraceae that are often known as marigolds.
The most commonly cultivated and used member of the genus is the pot marigold (Calendula officinalis).
officinalis is used as an anti-inflammatory and a remedy for healing wounds.Plant pharmacological studies have suggested that Calendula extracts have antiviral, antigenotoxic, and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro.
officinalis flowers was shown to have both spasmolytic and spasmogenic effects, thus providing a scientific rationale for this traditional use.
officinalis obtained by a novel extraction method has demonstrated antitumor (cytotoxic) activity and immunomodulatory properties (lymphocyte activation) in vitro, as well as antitumor activity in mice.Calendula plants are known to cause allergic reactions, and should be avoided during pregnancy.Flora Europaea: Calendula
The flowers were a common ingredient in German soups and stews, which explains the nickname ""pot marigold"".

Cannabidiol (CBD),Cannabidiol (CBD),"Of cases reported in 2019, more than 33% received medical attention and 46 people were admitted to a hospital intensive care unit.In October 2018, cannabidiol became legal for recreational and medical use by the federal Cannabis Act. As of August 2019, CBD products in Canada could only be sold by authorized retailers or federally licensed medical companies, limiting their access to the general public.
It was approved in 2018 by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of two rare forms of childhood epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.As of 2019, there was only limited high-quality evidence for cannabidiol having a neurological effect in people, mainly due to the weak design and small number of subjects in randomized controlled trials.CBD is classified as a medical product in Sweden.Selective breeding of cannabis plants has expanded and diversified as commercial and therapeutic markets develop."
Capsicum,Capsicum,"In Germany, the heatless varieties as well as the spice are called Paprika and the hot types are primarily called Peperoni or Chili while in Austria, Pfefferoni is more common for these; in Dutch, this word is also used exclusively for bell peppers, whereas chilli is reserved for powders, and hot pepper variants are referred to as Spaanse pepers (Spanish peppers).
In Mexico, the term chile is used for ""hot peppers"", while the heatless varieties are called pimiento (the masculine form of the word for pepper, which is pimienta).
In Japanese, tōgarashi (唐辛子, トウガラシ ""Chinese mustard"") refers to hot chili peppers, and particularly a spicy powder made from them which is used as a condiment, while bell peppers are called pīman (ピーマン, from the French piment or the Spanish pimiento).Sources:Capsicum fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked.
chinense fruits.The amount of capsaicin in hot peppers varies significantly among varieties, and is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU)."
Cascara Sagrada,Cascara Sagrada,"Some of the chemical constituents present in the bark may be excreted by the kidney following medicinal use, resulting in a harmless change in the color of the urine.Studies have shown that the extract from cascara bark also contains a substance called emodin, which may contribute to the laxative effect, due to its excitation of smooth muscle cells in the large intestine.Flora of British Columbia: Rhamnus purshiana
purshiana has been used continually for many years by both Pacific northwest native peoples and immigrant Euro-Americans as a laxative natural medicine, as one of several anthraquinone-containing herbal medicines including the leaf and fruits of senna, the latex of Aloe vera, and the root of the rhubarb plant.
Cascara was found in more drug preparations than any other natural product in North America, and is believed to be the most widely used cathartic in the world.Historically, cascara was used in traditional medicine as a laxative, and in the late 20th century, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use for this purpose."
Chondroitin Sulfate,Chondroitin Sulfate,"""NIH News: Efficacy of Glucosamine and Chondroitin Sulfate May Depend on Level of Osteoarthritis Pain"", Wednesday, February 22, 2006 at National Institutes of HealthWhile it is a prescription or over-the-counter drug in 22 countries, chondroitin is regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration.
They further denied the request to market it as safe, given that no human clinical trials were done, citing that animal studies are not sufficient for the approval of a dietary supplement.The effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes."
Clove,Clove,"Cloves are available throughout the year due to different harvest seasons in different countries.Eugenol composes 72–90% of the essential oil extracted from cloves, and is the compound most responsible for clove aroma.
Cloves are harvested at 1.5–2 centimetres (0.59–0.79 in) long, and consist of a long calyx that terminates in four spreading sepals, and four unopened petals that form a small central ball.Though long-used in traditional medicine, there is little evidence that clove oil containing eugenol is effective for toothache pain or other types of pain, although one review reported efficacy of eugenol combined with zinc oxide as an analgesic for alveolar osteitis.
Since 2009, clove cigarettes have been classified as cigars in the US.Because of the bioactive chemicals of clove, the spice may be used as an ant repellent.Cloves can be used to make a fragrance pomander when combined with an orange."
Coconut Oil,Coconut Oil,"Used by movie theatre chains to pop popcorn, coconut oil adds considerable saturated fat and calories to the snackfood while enhancing flavor, possibly a factor increasing further consumption of high-calorie snackfoods, energy balance, and weight gain.Other culinary uses include replacing solid fats produced through hydrogenation in baked and confectionery goods.
KERAFEDCoconut oil can be extracted through dry or wet processing.Many health organizations advise against the consumption of coconut oil due to its high levels of saturated fat, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, World Health Organization, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, American Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, British National Health Service, British Nutrition Foundation, and Dietitians of Canada.Marketing of coconut oil has created the inaccurate belief that it is a ""healthy food""."
Coconut Water,Coconut Water,"In this custom, the elderly person is made to drink an excessive amount of coconut water, eventually resulting in fever and death, the exact causes of which were not determined.Marketing claims attributing health benefits to coconut water are not based on science and are disallowed by certain regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.
It is also used to make nata de coco, a jelly-like food.Since the early 21st century, coconut water has been marketed in Western countries as a natural energy or sports drink having low levels of fat, carbohydrates, and calories, and significant electrolyte content.
However, the contents of primary electrolytes sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium per 100 millilitres (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz) serving of unprocessed coconut water are insignificant (2–7% of the DV) and not balanced."
Cod Liver Oil,Cod Liver Oil,"Cod liver oil is a dietary supplement derived from liver of cod fish (Gadidae).
Cod liver oil also contains vitamin A and vitamin D.
Pregnant women may want to consider consulting a doctor when taking cod liver oil because of the high amount of retinol.Fatty acid oxidation and environmental toxins content are reduced when purification processes are applied to produce refined fish oil products.Dan Dale Alexander
Scandinavian Vikings produced cod liver oil by laying birch tree branches over a kettle of water, and fresh livers were laid over the branches.
There was also a method for producing fresh raw cod liver oil.In the Industrial Revolution, cod liver oil became popular for industrial purposes.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a tablespoon (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080 μg of retinol (vitamin A) and 34 μg (1360 IU) of vitamin D."
Creatine,Creatine,"Creatine supplements are marketed in ethyl ester, gluconate, monohydrate, and nitrate forms.Creatine, which is synthesized in the liver and kidneys, is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and skeletal muscle, through an active transport system.
Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine, which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain.A 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant.
Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend that individuals younger than 18 years old not use creatine.People with kidney disease, high blood pressure, or liver disease should not take creatine as a dietary supplement.One well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations.A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea.Genetic deficiencies in the creatine biosynthetic pathway lead to various severe neurological defects."
DHEA,DHEA,"As DHEA-S can be converted back into DHEA, it serves as a circulating reservoir for DHEA, thereby extending the duration of DHEA.Metabolites of DHEA include DHEA-S, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA, 7α-hydroxyepiandrosterone, and 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, as well as androstenediol and androstenedione.Epigenetic clockDHEA supplements have been promoted for their claimed cancer prevention properties, but there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.DHEA has been found to competitively inhibit TRPV1.In 2011, the surprising discovery was made that DHEA, as well as DHEA-S, directly bind to and activate the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors of neurotrophins like nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with high affinity."
Deer Velvet,Deer Velvet,"Early commercial activity in Russia between the 1930s and 1980s led to the production of an alcohol extract from deer antler velvet marketed under the Russian drug trade name Pantocrin (also pantocrine or pantokrin).In the West, velvet antler is dried, powdered, and consumed in encapsulated form or via aqueous alcohol extract as a dietary supplement, for which it is monitored for potential manufacturing and advertising violations by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission.
A review published in 2012 summarized results from clinical research, including three studies on sports performance: ""Claims that velvet antler supplements have beneficial effects for any human condition are not currently supported by sound clinical data from human trials.""Moose, elk and deer produce new antlers yearly (primarily males, except in caribou/reindeer).
United States and Canada each produce 20 tons annually.S.W.A.T.S. Fitness and Performance was a dietary supplement company that sold deer antler spray and other products."
Devil's Claw,Harpagophytum,"Devil's claw's tuberous roots are used in folk medicine to reduce pain.Botany databases at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation Media related to Harpagophytum at Wikimedia CommonsHarpagophytum procumbens is mainly found in the eastern and south eastern parts of Namibia, Southern Botswana and the Kalahari region of the Northern Cape, South Africa.
Although there is no accepted clinical evidence of its efficacy and bioavailability, limited effects were noted for treating lower back pain and osteoarthritis.A Cochrane review of clinical research noted that devil's claw seems to reduce low back pain more than placebo, although evidence was of moderate quality at best.Harpagophytum procumbens inhabits deep, sandy soils, and occurs in areas with low annual rainfall (150–300 mm/year).
However, the range states have implemented measures to manage the trade sustainably and the proposal to protect the species by CITES was withdrawn.Various studies have examined the biological and ecological requirements of harvested and unharvested populations.
Stewart (2009) examined population structure, density, growth, mortality, and seed and fruit production in harvested and unharvested populations in the Kalahari savannas of South Africa."
Dong Quai,Dong Quai,"Angelica sinensis, commonly known as dong quai（ Chinese :当归 ） or ""female ginseng"" is a herb from the family Apiaceae, indigenous to China.
sinensis is commonly known as Chinese angelica (Chinese: 當歸; pinyin: dāngguī; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: tong-kui)  and is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine in the belief it benefits women's health, cardiovascular conditions, osteoarthrosis, inflammation, headache, infections, mild anemia, fatigue and high blood pressure.
Overall, the U.S. National Library of Medicine states that more evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of dong quai for most uses.Angelica

Eucalyptus,Eucalyptus,"The trunks and branches of the eucalyptus tree allow the largest known moth, Zelotypia stacyi (the bentwing ghost moth, having a wingspan up to 250 mm) to feed and protect their larva and pupa, respectively.Eucalypts originated between 35 and 50 million years ago, not long after Australia-New Guinea separated from Gondwana, their rise coinciding with an increase in fossil charcoal deposits (suggesting that fire was a factor even then), but they remained a minor component of the Tertiary rainforest until about 20 million years ago, when the gradual drying of the continent and depletion of soil nutrients led to the development of a more open forest type, predominantly Casuarina and Acacia species.
The Blue Mountains of southeastern Australia have been a centre of eucalypt diversification; their name is in reference to the blue haze prevalent in the area, believed derived from the volatile terpenoids emitted by these trees.Eucalyptus oil is readily steam distilled from the leaves and can be used for cleaning and as an industrial solvent, as an antiseptic, for deodorising, and in very small quantities in food supplements, especially sweets, cough drops, toothpaste and decongestants."
Folic Acid,Folic Acid,"Low levels in early pregnancy are believed to be the cause of more than half of babies born with NTDs. More than 80 countries use either mandatory or voluntary fortification of certain foods with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs. Long-term supplementation with relatively large amounts of folic acid is associated with small reduction in the risk of stroke and an increased risk of prostate cancer.
A 2018 review by authors based in the United Kingdom strongly recommended that mandatory fortification be reconsidered as a means of reducing the risk of neural tube defects.One meta-analysis reported that multi-year folic acid supplementation, in amounts in most of the included clinical trials at higher than the UL of 1,000 μg/day, reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular disease by a modest 4%."
Fucus Vesiculosus,Fucus Vesiculosus,"Fucus vesiculosus, known by the common names bladder wrack,  black tang, rockweed, bladder fucus, sea oak, black tany, cut weed, dyers fucus, red fucus, and rock wrack is a seaweed found on the coasts of the North Sea, the western Baltic Sea, and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Phlorotannins in Fucus vesiculosus act as chemical defenses against the marine herbivorous snail, Littorina littorea., while galactolipids act as herbivore deterrents against the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata.
Asexual reproduction in Baltic Sea populations is accomplished by the production of adventitious branches that come loose and reattach to the bottom by the formation of rhizoids.

Gelatin,Gelatin,"Depending upon the process of hydrolysis, peptides will have broad molecular weight ranges associated with physical and chemical methods of denaturation.The amino acid content of hydrolyzed collagen is the same as collagen.
The refining and recovering treatments including filtration, clarification, evaporation, sterilization, drying, rutting, grinding, and sifting to remove the water from the gelatin solution, to blend the gelatin extracted, and to obtain dried, blended, ground final product.Ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen may affect the skin by increasing the density of collagen fibrils and fibroblasts, thereby stimulating collagen production.
Another study found that collagen treatment may actually cause an exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.If the raw material used in the production of the gelatin is derived from bones, dilute acid solutions are used to remove calcium and other salts."
Glucosamine Hydrochloride,Glucosamine Hydrochloride,"Produced commercially by the hydrolysis of shellfish exoskeletons or, less commonly, by fermentation of a grain such as corn or wheat, glucosamine has many names depending on country.Although a common dietary supplement, there is little evidence that it is effective for relief of arthritis or pain, and is not an approved prescription drug.Two studies measured the concentrations of glucosamine in the synovial fluid and plasma after oral administration of glucosamine sulfate to both healthy volunteers and people with osteoarthritis.In the first study, glucosamine sulfate was given to healthy volunteers in doses of 750, 1500, or 3000 mg once daily.
Since glucosamine is classified as a dietary supplement in the United States, evidence of safety is required by FDA regulations, but evidence of efficacy is not required so long as it is not advertised as a treatment for a medical condition.In 2004, the FDA declared there was insufficient evidence for supplement manufacturers to state that glucosamine was effective for treating arthritis, joint degeneration, or cartilage deterioration, a position remaining in effect as of 2018.In most of Europe, glucosamine is approved as a medical drug and is sold in the form of glucosamine sulfate."

Goji,Goji,"The plant parts are called by the Latin names  lycii fructus (fruit), herba lycii (leaves), etc., in modern official pharmacopeias.Since about 2000, goji berry and derived products became common in developed countries as health foods or alternative medicine remedies, extending from exaggerated and unproven claims about their health benefits.Young wolfberry shoots and leaves are harvested commercially as a leaf vegetable.Since the early 21st century, the dried fruit has been marketed in the Western world as a health food, with unsupported health claims about its benefits.
There have been also commercial products of whole and ground wolfberry seeds, and seed oil.Lycium barbarum had been introduced in the United Kingdom in the 1730s by The Duke of Argyll, but the plant was mostly used for hedges and decorative gardening.The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) had initially placed goji berry in the Novel Foods list."
Grape,Grape,"In North America, the most common grape juice is purple and made from Concord grapes, while white grape juice is commonly made from Niagara grapes, both of which are varieties of native American grapes, a different species from European wine grapes.
In California, Sultana (known there as Thompson Seedless) grapes are sometimes diverted from the raisin or table market to produce white juice.Resveratrol, a stilbene compound, is found in widely varying amounts among grape varieties, primarily in their skins and seeds.
Vitis labrusca, the North American table and grape juice grapevines (including the Concord cultivar), sometimes used for wine, are native to the Eastern United States and Canada.
In the 19th century, Ephraim Bull of Concord, Massachusetts, cultivated seeds from wild Vitis labrusca vines to create the Concord grape which would become an important agricultural crop in the United States.In most of Europe and North America, dried grapes are referred to as ""raisins"" or the local equivalent."
Grapefruit,Grapefruit,"Grapefruit is a citrus hybrid originating in Barbados as an accidental cross between two introduced species – sweet orange (C.
In the first, the effect is from bergamottin, a natural furanocoumarin in both grapefruit flesh and peel that inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, (among others from the P450 enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs).
Hyuganatsu may also be a pummelo hybridThe varieties of Texas and Florida grapefruit include: Oro Blanco, Ruby Red, Pink, Rio Star, Thompson, White Marsh, Flame, Star Ruby, Duncan, and Pummelo HB.The name ""grapefruit"" seems to originate with the way that, unlike normal citrus, the fruits of this tree grow in ""clusters"", vaguely reminiscent of bunches of grapes.The genetic origin of the grapefruit is a hybrid mix.
One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (C."
Green Coffee,Green Coffee,"Nonvolatile nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action.
The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds.
The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30 mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethyl-xanthine) is the alkaloid most present in green and roasted coffee beans.
The content of chlorogenic acids in dried green coffee beans of robusta is 65 mg/g and of arabica 140 mg/g, depending on the timing of harvesting.
Chlorogenic acids increase the solubility of caffeine and are important modulators of taste.Volatile compounds of green coffee beans include short-chain fatty acids, aldehydes, and nitrogen-containing aromatic molecules, such as derivatives of pyrazines (green-herbeaceous-earthy odor)."
Guarana,Guarana,"The main natural phenols found in guarana are (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin.The word guarana comes from the Guaraní word guara-ná, which has its origins in the Sateré-Maué word for the plant, warana, that in Tupi-Guarani means ""fruit like the eyes of the people.""
The god then plucked the right eye from the child and planted it in the village, giving rise to domesticated guarana.The Guaranís make a herbal tea by shelling, washing and drying the seeds, followed by pounding them into a fine powder.
The word guaraná is widely used in Brazil and Paraguay as a reference to soft drinks containing guarana extract.In the United States, guarana fruit powder and seed extract have not been determined for status as ""generally recognized as safe"" (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration, but rather are approved as food additives for flavor (but not non-flavor) uses.Guarana is used in sweetened or carbonated soft drinks and energy drinks, an ingredient of herbal teas or contained in dietary supplement capsules."
Gymnema,Gymnema,"Common names include gymnema, Australian cowplant, and Periploca of the woods, and the Hindi term gurmar, which means ""sugar destroyer"".The leaves and extracts contain gymnemic acids, the major bioactive constituents that interact with taste receptors on the tongue to temporarily suppress the taste of sweetness.Reduction of sugar intake: G.
Research also suggests that Gymnema sylvestre extracts reduce cravings for sugar.
Diabetes:  Early research suggests when a specific gymnema extract (GS4) is taken orally along with insulin or diabetes medications, blood sugar reduction in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes is enhanced.
Early research suggests that taking a specific combination of Gymnema sylvestre extract, hydroxycitric acid, and niacin-bound chromium by mouth for 8 weeks might reduce body weight in people who are overweight or obese.
The major biologically active plant molecules are gymnemic acids, a class of triterpenoid saponins, which have the effect of suppressing the taste of sweetness on the tongue from sucrose (sugar), stevia, xylitol, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame.The sweet-blocking effect of G."
Hibiscus,Hibiscus,"40–90 AD).Several species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.A tea made from hibiscus flowers is known by many names around the world and is served both hot and cold.
The beverage is known for its red colour, tart flavour, and vitamin C content.The hibiscus is a national symbol of Haiti, and the national flower of nations including the Solomon Islands and Niue.
In Jamaica, Trinidad and many other islands in the Caribbean, the drink is known as sorrel (Hibiscus sabdariffa; not to be confused with Rumex acetosa, a species sharing the common name sorrel).
.Many species are grown for their showy flowers or used as landscape shrubs, and are used to attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.Hibiscus is a very hardy, versatile plant and in tropical conditions it can enhance the beauty of any garden."
Honey,Honey,"Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.Fermentation of honey usually occurs after crystallization, because without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth.
Evidence does not support the use of honey-based products for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers or ingrown toenail.Individual honeys from different plant sources contain over 100 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play a primary role in determining honey flavors and aromas.
The specific composition, color, aroma, and flavor of any batch of honey depend on the flowers foraged by bees that produced the honey.One 1980 study found that mixed floral honey from several United States regions typically contains:"
Hops,Hops,"Hops that have been released from the Charles Faram Wellhopped program include Jester®, Olicana®, Minstrel®, Archer®, Godiva™, Harlequin™ and Mystic™.Particular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles, for example pale lagers are usually brewed with European (often German, Polish or Czech) noble hop varieties such as Saaz, Hallertau and Strissel Spalt.
In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavor that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.In addition to water, cellulose, and various proteins, the chemical composition of hops consists of compounds important for imparting character to beer.The first documented hop cultivation was in 736, in the Hallertau region of present-day Germany, although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was 1079."
Horny Goat Weed,Horny Goat Weed,"The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation.Epimedium wushanense contains a number of flavanoids.
Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which are extending the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener.Species of Epimedium are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome.
Given suitable conditions most epimediums will form beautiful groundcover plants, often with magnificent new leaves tinted in bronze, copper and reds combining with a huge variety of flower colours and forms in spring.
With all varieties, however, the foliage is best cut off at ground level shortly before new leaves emerge, so as to fully reveal their beauty of form and colour."
Horsetail,Horsetail,"The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, inspired John Napier to invent logarithms.A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (Hippuris), is occasionally referred to as ""horsetail"", and adding to confusion, the name mare's tail is sometimes applied to Equisetum.Despite centuries of use in traditional medicine, there is no evidence that Equisetum has any medicinal properties.Equisetum arvense L.
The North American subspecies Equisetum hyemale affine (Engelm.) A.A.Eat. may be treated as a separate species Equisetum prealtum Raf. Equisetum laevigatum A.Braun – smooth horsetail, smooth scouring rush; western 3/4 of North America down into northwestern Mexico; also sometimes known as Equisetum kansanum
ex Weber & Mohr – variegated horsetail, variegated scouring rush; northern (cool temperate) zones worldwide, except for northeasternmost AsiaThe living members of the genus Equisetum are divided into three distinct lineages, which are usually treated as subgenera.
They are most common in northern North America (Canada and the northernmost United States), where the genus is represented by nine species (arvense, fluviatile, palustre, pratense, sylvaticum, hyemale, laevigatum, scirpoides, and variegatum)."
Iodine,Iodine,"Hence hydroiodic acid cannot be concentrated past this point by evaporation of water.Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen iodide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its dielectric constant is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H2I+ and HI−2 ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the bifluoride ions (HF−2) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and iodine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as Cs+ and NR+4 (R = Me, Et, Bun) may still be isolated."
L-Arginine,L-Arginine,"Schulze and Winterstein synthesized arginine from ornithine and cyanamide in 1899, but some doubts about arginine's structure lingered until Sørensen's synthesis of 1910.L-arginine is generally recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day.The amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a guanidinium group, which has a pKa of 12.48, and is therefore always protonated and positively charged at physiological pH.
Arginine is also a precursor for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate.) The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid in humans and rodents, as it may be required depending on the health status or lifecycle of the individual."
L-Tryptophan,L-Tryptophan,"Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan.The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression.In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon.
High blood plasma levels of other large neutral amino acids prevent the plasma concentration of tryptophan from increasing brain concentration levels.In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published.
Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan (with this being used as an explanation for sleepiness following consumption of the meat), the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry.As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins."
Lactobacillus,Lactobacillus,"Lactobacillus is the most common probiotic found in food such as yogurt, and it is diverse in its application to maintain human well-being, as it can help treat diarrhea, vaginal infections, and skin disorders such as eczema.Some Lactobacillus species are used as starter cultures in industry for controlled fermentation in the production of wine, yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, pickles, beer, cider, kimchi, cocoa, kefir, and other fermented foods, as well as animal feeds and the bokashi soil amendment.
Another example is Lactobacillus salivarius, which interacts with many pathogens through the production of salivaricin B, a bacteriocin.Many lactobacilli operate using homofermentative metabolism (they produce only lactic acid from sugars), and some species use heterofermentative metabolism (they can produce either alcohol or lactic acid from sugars).
Lactobacillus produce bacteriocins to suppress pathogenic growth of certain bacteria, as well as lactic acid and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide)."
Lipase,Lipase,"Lipases perform essential roles in digestion, transport and processing of dietary lipids (e.g. triglycerides, fats, oils) in most, if not all, living organisms.
For example, human pancreatic lipase (HPL), which is the main enzyme that breaks down dietary fats in the human digestive system, converts triglyceride substrates found in ingested oils to monoglycerides and two fatty acids.
albicans in human tissue.A diverse array of genetically distinct lipase enzymes are found in nature, and they represent several types of protein folds and catalytic mechanisms.
However, most are built on an alpha/beta hydrolase fold and employ a chymotrypsin-like hydrolysis mechanism using a catalytic triad consisting of a serine nucleophile, a histidine base, and an acid residue, usually aspartic acid.Lipase at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)Lipases are involved in diverse biological processes which range from routine metabolism of dietary triglycerides to cell signaling and inflammation.
Other lipase enzymes, such as pancreatic lipases, are secreted into extracellular spaces where they serve to process dietary lipids into more simple forms that can be more easily absorbed and transported throughout the body."
Lutein,Lutein,"The authors speculated that there may be a cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, but recommended more research.In humans, the Observed Safe Level (OSL) for lutein, based on a non-government organization evaluation, is 20 mg/day.
Skin health via orally consumed supplements is one of the fastest growing areas of the US$2 billion carotenoid market.This xanthophyll, like its sister compound zeaxanthin, has primarily been used in food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color.
Many songbirds (like golden oriole, evening grosbeak, yellow warbler, common yellowthroat and Javan green magpie, but not American goldfinch or yellow canaries) deposit lutein obtained from the diet into growing tissues to color their feathers.In 2013, findings of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study showed that a dietary supplement formulation containing lutein reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent."
Lycopene,Lycopene,"Foods that are not red may also contain lycopene, such as asparagus and parsley.In plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection.
The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then be transformed into a wide variety of xanthophylls.In a review of literature on lycopene and its potential role as a dietary antioxidant, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that   evidence was insufficient for lycopene having antioxidant effects in humans, particularly in skin, heart function, or vision protection from ultraviolet light.Although lycopene from tomatoes has been tested in humans for cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer, no effect on any disease was found.
Lycopene dietary supplements (in oil) may be more efficiently absorbed than lycopene from food.Lycopene is not an essential nutrient for humans, but is commonly found in the diet mainly from dishes prepared from tomatoes."
Maca,Maca,"Lepidium meyenii, known as maca or Peruvian ginseng, is an edible herbaceous biennial plant of the family Brassicaceae that is native to South America in the high Andes mountains of Peru.
Hypocotyls grown from Peruvian seeds form with difficulty at low elevations, in greenhouses, or in warm climates.Due to its purported effects on fertility, maca grew in agricultural, commercial and research interest over the decades of the 1990s to 2014.
Some sources consider the maca to be an annual plant, as in favorable years it can complete a lifecycle within a year.Maca is the only member of the genus Lepidium with a fleshy hypocotyl, which is fused with the taproot to form a rough inverted pear-shaped body.
Traditionally, native growers have acknowledged four varieties of maca, based on their root color: cream-yellow, half purple, purple, and black; varying levels of anthocyanin is primarily responsible for the color differences."
Manganese,Manganese,"Manganese exporter, membrane transport proteinExcessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.National Pollutant Inventory – Manganese and compounds Fact Sheet
The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811–1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability.
Several colorful oxides of manganese, for example manganese dioxide, are abundant in nature and have been used as pigments since the Stone Age. The cave paintings in Gargas that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old contain manganese pigments.Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers, either to add to, or remove color from glass."
Mangosteen,Mangosteen,"In Vietnam, the ripe fruit is also used as a salad ingredient.The extract of mangosteen peels are traditionally used in Indonesia as the source of natural dye for textile colouring; to acquire brown, dark brown, purple to red hues, especially applied in traditional tenun ikat and batik textiles.Major mangosteen production occurs in Southeast Asia, mainly in Thailand as the country with the most acreage planted, estimated at 4,000 ha in 1965 and 11,000 ha in 2000, giving a total yield of 46,000 tons.
If the exocarp is soft and yielding as it is when ripe and fresh from the tree, the fruit is usually good.The edible endocarp of the mangosteen has the same shape and size as a tangerine 4–6 centimetres (1.6–2.4 in) in diameter, but is white."
Maritime Pine,Maritime Pine,"It is a hard, fast growing pine containing small seeds with large wings.Pinus pinaster is particularly successful in regions with fynbos vegetation because it is adapted to high-intensity fires, thus allowing it to outcompete other species that are not as well adapted to high-intensity fires.
pinaster seedlings (r=–0.41, p<0.05).Several other characteristics contribute to their success in the regions they have invaded, including their ability to grow rapidly and to produce small seeds with large wings.
The small seeds with large wings are beneficial for wind dispersal, which is the key to reaching new areas in regions with fynbos vegetation.
It is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range.Pinus pinaster is a popular topic in ecology because of its problematic growth and spread in South Africa for the past 150 years after being imported into the region at the end of the 17th century (1685–1693).
The pine tree species invades large areas and more specifically fynbos vegetation."
Methylsulfonylmethane,Methylsulfonylmethane,"An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources, intestinal bacterial metabolism, and the body's endogenous methanethiol metabolism.Published clinical trials of MSM did not report any serious side effects, but there are no peer-reviewed data on the effects of its long-term use in humans.Small-scale studies of possible treatments with MSM have been conducted on both animals and humans.
MSM is considered 'Possibly Safe' at therapeutic doses, although further research is still needed to assess its safety for long-term use.A review of two small randomized controlled trials of methylsulfonylmethane in osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain relief ""reported significant improvement in pain outcomes in the treatment group compared to comparator treatments; however, methodological issues and concerns over optimal dosage and treatment period were highlighted."" The two trials included 168 people, of whom 52 received MSM, either 1.5 g/day or 6.0 g/day."
Niacin,Niacin,"With long-term use, the adverse effects of high-dose niacin therapy also include hepatic dysfunction (associated with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite), hepatitis, and acute liver failure; these hepatotoxic effects of niacin occur more often when extended-release dosage forms are used.
The extended release formulations generally reduce vasodilation and flushing side effects, but increase the risk of hepatotoxicity compared to the immediate release forms.A formulation of laropiprant (Merck & Co., Inc.) and niacin had previously been approved for use in Europe and marketed as Tredaptive.
The resulting name niacin was derived from nicotinic acid + vitamin.The high doses of niacin used to improve the lipid profile have been shown to elevate blood sugar by 5-10%, thereby worsening existing diabetes mellitus.One review found that niacin therapy was associated with an increase in the risk of new-onset diabetes over 3.6 years from 4.9% to 5.5%.Niacin is available as a prescription product, and in the United States as a dietary supplement."
Niacinamide,Niacinamide,"While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing.
NAD+ and NADP+ are coenzymes in a wide variety of enzymatic oxidation-reduction reactions, most notably glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.
If humans ingest nicotinamide, it will likely undergo a series of reactions that transform it into NAD, which can then undergo a transformation to form NADP+.
In NAD+, the nitrogen in the aromatic nicotinamide ring is covalently bonded to adenine dinucleotide.
This higher energy product later releases its energy with the release of a hydride, and in the case of the electron transport chain, it assists in forming adenosine triphosphate.When one mole of NADH is oxidized, 158.2 kJ of energy will be released.Nicotinamide is the preferred treatment for pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency.
While niacin may be used, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing.Nicotinamide has minimal side effects."
Oats,Oak,"The Kaiser's Oak, located at the village of Gommecourt in Artois, France, named in honour of Kaiser Wilhelm II, symbolically marked from late 1914 to April 1917 the furthest point in the West of the German Imperial Army during World War One. The Wye Oak in Maryland was the United States' largest white oak tree before it blew down in a storm in 2002, at an estimated age of 460 years.
The Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a very slow evolving clade compared to other angiosperms, and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in Quercus pose a great challenge to the concept of a species since a species is often defined as a group of ""actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."" By this definition, many species of Quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and, to a large extent, genetic data.The oak is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries."
Olive,Olive,"The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning ""European olive"", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands and Réunion.
Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives.
As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.Picholine or directly-brined type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, they are soaked in lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10–72 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of the way into the fruit."
Omega-6 Fatty Acids,Omega-6 Fatty Acids,"Members of the family can have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects.The biological effects of the omega-6 fatty acids are largely produced during and after physical activity for the purpose of promoting growth and during the inflammatory cascade to halt cell damage and promote cell repair by their conversion to omega-6 eicosanoids that bind to diverse receptors found in every tissue of the body.Industry-sponsored studies have suggested that omega-6 fatty acids should be consumed in a 1:1 ratio to omega-3, though it has been observed that the diet of many individuals today is at a ratio of about 16:1, mainly from vegetable oils.
A ratio of 2.5-to-1 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer, whereas a ratio of 4-to-1 had no effect.Excess omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils interfere with the health benefits of omega-3 fats, in part because they compete for the same rate-limiting enzymes."
Oregano,Oregano,"A closely related plant is marjoram from Turkey, which differs significantly in taste though, because phenolic compounds are missing from its essential oil.

They have a reputation for sweet and spicy tones, with little bitterness, and are prized for their flavor and compatibility with various recipes and sauces.Oregano is a culinary herb, used for the flavor of its leaves, which can be more flavorful when dried than fresh.
The dried and ground leaves are most often used in Greece to add flavor to Greek salad, and is usually added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that accompanies fish or meat grills and casseroles.Accepted subspecies:"
Oscillococcinum,Oscillococcinum,"Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an ""imprint"" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo.Oscillococcinum was originally proposed by the French physician  Joseph Roy, based on his misidentification of an oscillating bacterium he named oscillococcus in victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917-1918.

Ronald Lindsay, CFI and CSI president and chief executive officer, contends, ""If Boiron is going to sell snake oil, the least they can do is use English on their labels.”A class action lawsuit was filed against Boiron on behalf of ""all California residents who purchased Oscillo at any time within the past four years."" The lawsuit charges that Boiron ""falsely advertises that Oscillo has the ability to cure the flu because it contains an active ingredient it claims is proven to get rid of flu symptoms in 48 hours."" The lawsuit also states that the listed active ingredient in Oscillococcinum (Oscillo) ""is actually Muscovy Duck Liver and Heart ..."
Palm Oil,Palm Oil,"Additionally, in 1992, in response to concerns about deforestation, the Government of Malaysia pledged to limit the expansion of palm oil plantations by retaining a minimum of half the nation's land as forest cover.Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.The highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions, making it a cheap substitute for butter or hydrogenated vegetable oils in uses where solid fat is desirable, such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods.
These milk substitutes contain 30% milk powder and the remainder of raw protein made from skimmed milk powder, whey powder, and vegetable fats, mostly coconut oil and palm oil.Thailand is the world's third largest producer of crude palm oil, producing approximately two million tonnes per year, or 1.2% of global output."
Pantothenic Acid,Pantothenic Acid,"These AIs are similar to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in United States - that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid.For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).
As intake increases 10-fold, however, absorption rate decreases to 10%.Although pantothenic acid supplementation is under preliminary research for a variety of human diseases, there is insufficient evidence to date that it has any effect.Content of pantothenic acid varies among manufactured and natural foods, especially fortified ready-to-eat cereals,  infant formulas, energy bars and dried foods.
Deficiency symptoms in other nonruminant animals include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established as synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts."
Papaya,Papaya,"The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.Raw papaya pulp contains 88% water, 11% carbohydrates, and negligible fat and protein (table).
The infected papaya will turn yellow and drop to the ground after infestation by the papaya fruit fly.The two-spotted spider mite is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish yellow translucent oval pest.
If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.The papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves.
The unripe green fruit can be eaten cooked, and is used as an ingredient in salads and stews.The black seeds of the papaya are edible and have a sharp, spicy taste."
Pau D'Arco,"Pau d'Arco, Pará",Pau d'Arco is a municipality in the state of Pará in the Northern region of Brazil.List of municipalities in Pará
Peanut Oil,Peanut Oil,"It is often used in American, Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking, and in the case of roasted oil, for added flavor.Peanut oil at WebMDThose allergic to peanuts can consume highly refined peanut oil, but should avoid first-press, organic oil.
Most highly refined peanut oils remove the peanut allergens and have been shown to be safe for ""the vast majority of peanut-allergic individuals"".
However, cold-pressed peanut oils may not remove the allergens and thus could be highly dangerous to people with peanut allergy.Since the degree of processing for any particular product is often unclear, ""avoidance is prudent.""Its major component fatty acids are oleic acid (46.8% as olein), linoleic acid (33.4% as linolein), and palmitic acid (10.0% as palmitin).
Peanut oil is safe for use as a massage oil.Unrefined peanut oil has a smoke point of 320 °F/160 °C and is used as a flavorant for dishes akin to sesame oil."
Pennyroyal,Mentha pulegium,"Though they differ in genera, they share similar chemical properties.Study conducted on rats shows that pulegone can cause delayed action potential in cardiac muscles.
November 1978 – An 18-year-old pregnant woman from Denver, Colorado, died after ingesting one ounce of concentrated pennyroyal oil in an effort to abort her fetus.
Prior to her death, the woman had reported using the dried leaves of the plant to induce menstruation with no ill effects.
Since the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in October 1994 all manufactured forms of pennyroyal in the United States have carried a warning label against its use by pregnant women, but pennyroyal is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.At least one study has shown pennyroyal oil to have potent acaricidal activity against house dust mites.Pennyroyal is toxic to humans and has differing effects dependent on the volume and concentration ingested."
Phosphate Salts,Phosphate Salts,"Phosphate also forms families or condensed anions including di-, tri-, tetra-, and polyphosphates.
Most of these salts are known in both anhydrous (water-free) and hydrated forms.
The hydrates are more common than the anhydrous forms.Sodium phosphates have many applications in food and for water treatment.
However, oral sodium phosphates when taken at high doses for bowel preparation for colonoscopy may in some individuals carry a risk of kidney injury under the form of phosphate nephropathy.
Since safe and effective replacements for phosphate purgatives are available, several medical authorities have recommended general disuse of oral phosphates.In addition to these phosphates, sodium forms a number of useful salts with pyrophosphates (also called diphosphates), triphosphates and high polymers.
Beyond the diphosphates, sodium salts are known triphosphates, e.g. sodium triphosphate and tetraphospates.
The cyclic polyphosphates, called metaphosphates, include the trimer sodium trimetaphosphate and the tetramer, Na3P3O9 and Na4P4O12, respectively."
Propolis,Propolis,"Normally, it is dark brown in color, but it can be found in green, red, black, and white hues, depending on the sources of resin found in the particular hive area.
Honey bees are opportunists, gathering what they need from available sources, and detailed analyses show that the chemical composition of propolis varies considerably from region to region, along with the vegetation.
Propolis also contains persistent lipophilic acaricides, a natural pesticide that deters mite infestations.In neotropical regions, in addition to a large variety of trees, bees may also gather resin from flowers in the genera Clusia and Dalechampia, which are the only known plant genera that produce floral resins to attract pollinators.
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is also a component of some varieties of propolis from New Zealand.Occasionally, worker bees will even gather various caulking compounds of human manufacture, when the usual sources are more difficult to obtain."
Raspberry Ketone,Raspberry Ketone,"It is one of the most expensive natural flavor components used in the food industry.
Synthetic raspberry ketone is cheaper, with estimates ranging from a couple of dollars per pound to one fifth of the cost of the natural product.Although products containing this compound are marketed for weight loss, there is no clinical evidence for this effect in humans.Raspberry ellagitanninSince the natural abundance of raspberry ketone is very low, it is prepared industrially by a variety of methods from chemical intermediates.
This two-step method produces raspberry ketone in 99% yield.
There is a less expensive hydrogenation catalyst, nickel boride, which also demonstrates high selectivity towards hydrogenation of the double bond of enone.Little is known about the long-term safety of raspberry ketone supplements, especially since little research has been done with humans.
It can be extracted from the fruit, yielding about 1–4 mg per kg of raspberries."
Reishi Mushroom,Reishi Mushroom,"It is often used with nấm, the Vietnamese word for ""mushroom"", thus nấm linh chi is the equivalent of ""lingzhi mushroom"".It was once thought that Ganoderma lucidum generally occurred in two growth forms: a large, sessile, specimen with a small or nonexistent stalk, found in North America, and a smaller specimen with a long, narrow stalk found mainly in the tropics.
The Shennong bencao jing (Divine Farmer's Classic of Pharmaceutics) of c.200–250 CE, classifies zhi into six color categories, each of which is believed to benefit the qi, or ""life force"", in a different part of the body: qingzhi (青芝; ""Green Mushroom"") for the liver, chizhi (赤芝; ""Red Mushroom"") for the heart, huangzhi (黃芝; ""Yellow Mushroom"") for the spleen, baizhi (白芝; ""White Mushroom"") for the lungs, heizhi (黑芝; ""Black Mushroom"") for the kidneys, and zizhi (紫芝; ""Purple Mushroom"") for the Essence."
Resveratrol,Resveratrol,"A 2018 review of resveratrol effects on blood pressure found that some people had increased frequency of bowel movements and loose stools, and one person taking a 1000 mg daily dose developed an itchy rash.Resveratrol is a phytoalexin, a class of compounds produced by many plants when they are infected by pathogens or physically harmed by cutting, crushing, or ultraviolet radiation.Plants that synthesize resveratrol include knotweeds, pine trees including Scots pine and Eastern white pine, grape vines, peanut plants, cocoa bushes, and Vaccinium shrubs that produce berries, including blueberries, raspberries, mulberries, cranberries, and bilberries.Resveratrol is under preliminary research for its potential to limit secondary damage after ischemic stroke or acute brain trauma, and its possible effect on cognition.Resveratrol has been identified as a pan-assay interference compound, which produces positive results in many different laboratory assays."
Riboflavin,Riboflavin,"Visually, it imparts color to vitamin supplements (and bright yellow color of urine in persons taking it).Food and beverages that provide riboflavin without fortification are milk, cheese, eggs, leaf vegetables, liver, kidneys, lean meats, legumes, mushrooms, and almonds.The milling of cereals results in considerable loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries by addition of the vitamin.
The limited data available on riboflavin’s adverse effects do not mean, however, that high intakes have no adverse effects, and the Food and Nutrition Board urges people to be cautious about consuming excessive amounts of riboflavin.In other animals, riboflavin deficiency results in lack of growth, failure to thrive, and eventual death.
Over-the-counter dietary supplements are available in the United States with doses as high as 100 mg, but there is no evidence that these high doses have any additional benefit for healthy people.The National Academy of Medicine (then the U.S. Institute of Medicine [IOM]) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998."
Roman Chamomile,Roman Chamomile,"Chamaemelum nobile commonly known as chamomile (also spelled camomile) or under its synonym Anthemis nobilis, Roman chamomile, English chamomile, garden chamomile, ground apple, low chamomile, mother's daisy or whig plant, is a low perennial plant found in dry fields and around gardens and cultivated grounds in Europe, North America, and in Argentina.

Rose Hip,Rose Hip,"Media related to Rose hip at Wikimedia CommonsRose hips are used for herbal teas, jam, jelly, syrup, rose hip soup, beverages, pies, bread, wine, and marmalade.
A few rose species are sometimes grown for the ornamental value of their hips, such as Rosa moyesii, which has prominent large red bottle-shaped fruits.
Rose hips are commonly used as an herbal tea, often blended with hibiscus, and an oil is also extracted from the seeds.
They can also be used to make jam, jelly, marmalade, and rose hip wine.
Rose hip soup, ""nyponsoppa"", is especially popular in Sweden.
Rose hips can be used to make pálinka, the traditional Hungarian fruit brandy popular in Hungary, Romania, and other countries sharing Austro-Hungarian history.
The fine hairs found inside rose hips are used as itching powder.
Most species require chilling (stratification), with some such as Rosa canina only germinating after two winter chill periods have occurred.Rose hip seed oil

Senna,Senna,"An exhibition also took place that showcased Senna's victories around Monaco, along with his helmets that were borrowed from Senna's family and a selection of McLaren cars raced by Senna that were brought over from Motegi.On 21 March 2010, on the day that would have marked Senna's 50th birthday, the football team Corinthians, which Senna supported, played a tape in memory of Senna which was also part of the theme played at the São Paulo Motor Show.On 25 July 2010, the BBC motoring show, Top Gear paid an emotional tribute to Senna with British Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton driving Senna's original MP4/4, with which he won the 1988 title.
Until then I had a good relationship with Derek."" Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races."
Shark Cartilage,Shark Cartilage,"Numerous cancers in sharks, including tumors in shark cartilage, were documented by Gary Ostrander and his colleagues from the University of Hawaii in research published in 2004.The ongoing consumption of shark cartilage supplements has been linked to a significant decline in shark populations and the popularity of these supplements has been described as a triumph of pseudoscience and marketing over scientific evaluation.Information on shark cartilage, from WebMD.comIn the summer of 2004, Lane Labs, the manufacturers of BeneFin, was ordered to cease the promotion of BeneFin as a treatment or cure for cancer, as they had not conducted any research as to their claims for the product, much less reported any potential side effects.
Thus, the FDA ordered Lane Labs to ""pay restitution to all of its customers from September of 1999 to the present.""Manufacturers of shark cartilage supplements provide anecdotal testimonials from those who claim to have experienced relief from arthritis symptoms and pain, as a result of taking shark cartilage supplements.Opponents cite existing studies of shark cartilage on a variety of cancers that produced negligible to non-existent results in the prevention or treatment of cancer."
Siberian Ginseng,Siberian Ginseng,"Eleutherococcus senticosus is a species of small, woody shrub in the family Araliaceae native to Northeastern Asia.
senticosus are sold as a dietary supplement or cosmetic, usually under the name Siberian ginseng.Eleutherococcus senticosus Photos (PlantSystematics.org)Extracts from the root of Eleutherococcus senticosus have a reputation in traditional medicine for providing health effects, but such claims are not supported by medical evidence.

Eleutherococcus senticosus is sometimes found in oak groves at the foot of cliffs, rarely in high forest riparian woodland.
E. senticosus is broadly tolerant of soils, growing in sandy, loamy, and heavy clay soils with acid, neutral, or alkaline chemistry and including soils of low nutritional value.
E. senticosus is a deciduous shrub growing to 2 metres (6.6 ft) at a slow rate."
Slippery Elm,Slippery Elm,"Ulmus rubra, the slippery elm, is a species of elm native to eastern North America, ranging from southeast North Dakota, east to Maine and southern Quebec, south to northernmost Florida, and west to eastern Texas, where it thrives in moist uplands, although it will also grow in dry, intermediate soils.
The tree was first named as part of Ulmus americana in 1753, but identified as a separate species, Ulmus rubra, in 1793 by Pennsylvania botanist Gotthilf Muhlenberg.
Specimens supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U.

Spearmint,Spearmint,"Spearmint, also known as garden mint, common mint, lamb mint and mackerel mint, is a species of mint, Mentha spicata, native to Europe and southern temperate Asia, extending from Ireland in the west to southern China in the east.
The name 'spear' mint derives from the pointed leaf tips.Mentha spicata varies considerably in leaf blade dimensions, the prominence of leaf veins, and pubescence.Fungal diseases are common diseases in spearmint.
The other nematode species are Pratylenchus which cause root lesions.The main chemical component of spearmint is the terpenoid carvone, which has been shown to aid in the inhibition of tumors.
Antispasmodic effects have been displayed in spearmint oil and carvone, the main chemical component of spearmint.Studies on spearmint have shown varying results on the antioxidant effects of the plant and its extracts.
Antioxidant activity has been shown to be significantly higher in spearmint that is dried at lower temperatures rather than high."
Stevia,Stevia,"In the United States, high-purity stevia glycoside extracts have been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) since 2008, and are allowed in food products, but stevia leaf and crude extracts do not have GRAS or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in food.
In 2006, research data compiled in the safety evaluation released by the World Health Organization found no adverse effects.In December 2008, the FDA gave a ""no objection"" approval for GRAS status to Truvia (developed by Cargill and the Coca-Cola Company) and PureVia (developed by PepsiCo and the Whole Earth Sweetener Company, a subsidiary of Merisant), both of which use rebaudioside A derived from the stevia plant.
In May 2008, Coca-Cola and Cargill announced the availability of Truvia, a consumer brand stevia sweetener containing erythritol and Rebiana, which the FDA permitted as a food additive in December 2008."
Thiamine,Thiamine,"Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and disorders that result from it, including beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy.
Thiamine is required for metabolism including that of glucose, amino acids, and lipids.Thiamine was discovered in 1897, was the first vitamin to be isolated in 1926, and was first made in 1936.
Varying degrees of thiamine deficiency have been associated with the long-term use of high doses of diuretics, particularly furosemide in the treatment of heart failure.Complex thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria, some protozoans, plants, and fungi.
At present, this view seems to be oversimplified: pyruvate dehydrogenase is only one of several enzymes requiring thiamine diphosphate as a cofactor; moreover, other thiamine phosphate derivatives have been discovered since then, and they may also contribute to the symptoms observed during thiamine deficiency."
Vitamin B6,Vitamin B6,"Its active form, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, serves as a coenzyme in some 100 enzyme reactions in amino acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism.Vitamin B6 is widely distributed in foods in both its free and bound forms.
The trapped pyridoxine and pyridoxamine are oxidized to pyridoxal phosphate in the tissue.The products of vitamin B6 metabolism are excreted in the urine, the major product of which is 4-pyridoxic acid.
Other products of vitamin B6 metabolism excreted in the urine when high doses of the vitamin have been given include pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxine and their phosphates.
It was not possible to set a UL for infants, so intake is recommended in the form of food, milk or formula."" The ULs were set using results of studies involving long-term oral administration of pyridoxine at doses of less than 1 g/day.
Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase is dependent on flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as a cofactor produced from riboflavin (vitamin B2).PLP has been implicated in increasing or decreasing the expression of certain genes."
Vitamin K,Vitamin K,"There is evidence that the conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrenone) form.Although allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set.
Specifically vitamin K1 has been associated with severe adverse reactions such as bronchospasm and cardiac arrest when given intravenously as opposed to orally.Blood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4) and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4), showed no increase in blood clot risk."
Whey Protein,Whey Protein,"Concentrates (WPC) have typically a low (but still significant) level of fat and cholesterol but, in general, compared to the other forms of whey protein, they are higher in carbohydrates in the form of lactose — they are 29%–89% protein by weight.
Native whey protein is extracted from skim milk, not a byproduct of cheese production, and produced as a concentrate and isolate.There is evidence that whey protein is better absorbed than casein or soy protein.Whey protein is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement, typically sold in powdered form for mixing into beverages.
The EFSA concluded that the provided literature did not adequately support the proposed claims.Although whey proteins are responsible for some milk allergies, the major allergens in milk are the caseins.Whey protein resources, National Dairy Council
The whey protein accounts for about 40–45% of the solids content of ricotta.The protein in cow's milk is 20% whey and 80% casein."

Willow Bark,Willow Bark,"Willows, also called sallows and osiers, form the genus Salix, around 400 species of deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.
Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) rarely exceeds 6 cm (2.4 in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.Almost all willows take root very readily from cuttings or where broken branches lie on the ground.
Willow water, using the biological rooting hormones indolebutyric acid and salicylic acid from willow branches to stimulate root growth in new cuttingsWillow species are hosts to more than a hundred aphid species, belonging to Chaitophorus and other genera, forming large colonies to feed on plant juices, on the underside of leaves in particular."
Yerba Mate,Yerba Mate,"Yerba mate can be found in various energy drinks on the market, as well as being sold as a bottled or canned iced tea.The yerba mate plant is grown and processed in South America, specifically in northern Argentina (Corrientes, Misiones), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul).
Sugar may or may not be added; it may also be prepared with cold water (tereré).Drinking mate with friends from a hollow gourd (also called a guampa, porongo or mate in Spanish, cabaça or cuia in Portuguese, or zucca in Italian) through a metal straw (a bombilla in Spanish, bomba in Portuguese), refilling and passing to the next person after finishing the few mouthfuls of beverage, is a common social practice in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and southern Brazil among people of all ages."
Zinc,Zinc,"Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months.A Cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely to progress to age-related macular degeneration.Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants.Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.In 2011, researchers reported that adding large amounts of zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs."
