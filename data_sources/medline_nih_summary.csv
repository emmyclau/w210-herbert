Acai,Açaí palm,"The açaí palm (, Portuguese: [asaˈi] (listen), from Nheengatu asai), Euterpe oleracea, is a species of palm tree (Arecaceae) cultivated for its fruit (açaí berries, or simply açaí), hearts of palm (a vegetable), leaves, and trunk wood.
In a study of three traditional Caboclo populations in the Brazilian Amazon, açaí palm was described as the most important plant species because the fruit makes up a major component of their diet, up to 42% of the total food intake by weight.In North America, açaí is commonly sold in ""açaí bowls"", a combination of frozen açaí puree or açaí powder with other ingredients, such as nut milk, fruit juice, fruit, nuts, oatmeal, and sweeteners.
Tree trunks may be processed to yield dietary minerals.Comprising 80% of the fruit mass, açaí seeds may be ground for livestock food or as a component of organic soil for plants."
Aloe Vera,Aloe Vera,"In areas that receive frost or snow, the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.There is large-scale agricultural production of Aloe vera in Australia, Bangladesh, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, India, Jamaica, Spain, where it grows even well inland, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa, along with the USA to supply the cosmetics industry.Media related to Aloe vera at Wikimedia CommonsAloe vera is a stemless or very short-stemmed plant growing to 60–100 cm (24–39 in) tall, spreading by offsets.
Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera forms arbuscular mycorrhiza, a symbiosis that allows the plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.Aloe vera leaves contain phytochemicals under study for possible bioactivity, such as acetylated mannans, polymannans, anthraquinone C-glycosides, anthrones, and other anthraquinones, such as emodin and various lectins.Although there is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes, the cosmetics and alternative medicine industries regularly make claims regarding the soothing, moisturizing, and healing properties of aloe vera."
Asian Ginseng,Asian Ginseng,"Panax ginseng, the ginseng, also known as Asian ginseng, Chinese ginseng, or Korean ginseng, is a species of plant whose root is the original source of ginseng.
It is a perennial plant that grows in the mountains of Eastern Asia.Panax ginseng is one of the most commonly cultivated ginseng species, along with  P.
notoginseng (grown naturally in China), P.
ginseng (grown naturally in China and South Korea), and P.
quinquefolius.Ginseng is used as an herb in folk medicine.Panax ginseng is called Rén shēn (人蔘; lit.
ginseng) in Chinese and insam (인삼) in Korean.American ginsengPanax ginseng is native to mountainous regions of Russian Far East, Northeastern China, and the Korean Peninsula.
It is a protected plant in Russia and China, and most commercial ginseng is now sourced from plants cultivated in China, Korea and Russia.
The plant is a slow-growing perennial and the roots are usually harvested when the plants are five or six years old."
Astragalus,Astragalus,"Some pale-flowered vetches (Vicia spp.) are similar in appearance, but they are more vine-like than Astragalus.Astragalus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including many case-bearing moths of the genus Coleophora: C.
The calyx is tubular or bell-shaped.The genus was formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum.The name Astragalus is Greek, an old name for this group of plants which were believed to have a positive effect on goat milk production.Astragalus has been used in traditional Chinese medicine over centuries to treat various disorders, but there is no high-quality evidence it is effective or safe for any medical purpose.Although astragalus supplements are generally well tolerated, mild gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions may occur.
Some astragalus species may contain high levels of selenium, possibly causing toxicity.Extracts of astragalus root include diverse phytochemicals, such as saponins and isoflavone flavonoids, which are purported in traditional practices to increase lactation in nursing mothers."
Bilberry,Bilberry,"Bilberries, or occasionally European blueberries, are a primarily Eurasian species of low-growing shrubs in the genus Vaccinium (family Ericaceae), bearing edible, dark blue berries.
Fruits are mostly collected from wild plants growing on publicly accessible lands throughout northern and central Europe, where they are plentiful – for example, up to a fifth (17–21%) of the land area of Sweden contains bilberry bushes.
Bilberry is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (see the list of Lepidoptera that feed on Vaccinium).The fruits are eaten fresh or made into jams, fools, juices or pies.
There have been severe outbreaks in Staffordshire, England.Bilberries – which are native to Europe – are different from North American blueberries, although the species are closely related and belong to the same genus, Vaccinium.
The high anthocyanin content may cause staining of the fingers, lips, and tongue of consumers.Bilberries include several closely related species of the genus Vaccinium, including:"
Bitter Orange,Bitter Orange,"Bitter orange, Seville orange, sour orange, bigarade orange, or marmalade orange refers to a citrus tree (Citrus × aurantium) and its fruit.
The dried peels are used in the creation of Curaçao liqueur.While the raw pulp is not edible, Seville orange (or bigarade) is a widely known, particularly tart orange which is now grown throughout the Mediterranean region.
Iraqis also consume it as a citrus fruit or juice it to make bitter orange juice ""'aseer raranj"".
The Seville orange variety is used in the production of marmalade and also used to make French bigarade sauce.Bitter orange is also employed in herbal medicine as a stimulant and appetite suppressant, due to its active ingredient, synephrine.
Bitter orange supplements have been linked to a number of serious side effects and deaths, and consumer groups advocate that people avoid using the fruit medically."
Black Cohosh,Black Cohosh,"Although its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines and dietary supplements, black cohosh is not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease.A. racemosa grows in dependably moist, fairly heavy soil.
It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Black cohosh contains diverse phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and estrogen-like compounds (isoflavones) implicated in effects of black cohosh extracts on hot flashes in menopausal women, although there is no effect confirmed by high-quality clinical research.National Institutes of Health (NIH) ""Workshop on the Safety of Black Cohosh in Clinical Studies""  November 2004.pdfBlack cohosh is a smooth (glabrous) herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, compound leaves from an underground rhizome, reaching a height of 25–60 cm (9.8–23.6 in)."
Butterbur,Butterbur,"The fruits (in this case called achenes) may be smooth or hairy, winged, nobby or have hooked spines.The most common uses of Ranunculus species in traditional medicines are anti-rheumatism, intermittent fever and rubefacient.
Not all taxonomists and users accept this splitting of the genus, and it can alternatively be treated in the broad sense.Ranunculus abortivus – littleleaf buttercup
Ranunculus aconitifolius – aconite-leaf buttercup
Ranunculus acris – meadow buttercup
Ranunculus amphitrichus – small river buttercup
Ranunculus asiaticus – Persian buttercup

Uncaria tomentosa, a plant species found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America and used in traditional medicine"
Chamomile,Chamomile,"Chamomile (American English) or camomile (British English; see spelling differences) ( KAM-ə-myl or KAM-ə-meel) is the common name for several daisy-like plants of the family Asteraceae.
Two of the species are commonly used to make herbal infusions for traditional medicine, although there is no evidence that chamomile has any effect on health or diseases.Chamomile has historically been used in beer .
When used as an herbal product, such as in tea or as a topical skin cream, chamomile is not likely to have significant health effects or major side effects.PLANTS Profile: Anthemis tinctoria L.
Chamaemelum nobile, Roman, English or garden chamomile, also frequently used, (C.
This does not mean they are used in the same manner as the species used in the herbal tea known as ""chamomile"".
Plants including the common name ""chamomile"", of the family Asteraceae, are:
Chamaemelum nobile, Roman Chamomile"
Chasteberry,Chasteberry,"Vitex agnus-castus, also called vitex,  chaste tree (or chastetree), chasteberry, Abraham's balm, lilac chastetree, or monk's pepper, is a native of the Mediterranean region.
It has been long believed to be an anaphrodisiac – leading to its name as chaste tree – but its effectiveness for such action remains unproven.Vitex is a cross-pollinating plant, but its self-pollination has been recorded.Medicine Docs: Vitex agnus-castus (medicinal plant)The flowering and ripening processes do not happen simultaneously, enabling harvesting of both fresh fruits and seeds over a long span of time.
In this case chaste tree can be used as a biological control agent by planting it around vineyards to trap the Hyalesthus obsoletus.V. agnus-castus was found not only to be an appropriate food source for the adult vectors, but also a reservoir of Candidatus Phytoplasma solani (bacterial Phytoplasma species), the causal agent of the Black wood disease in grapevines."
Cinnamon,Cinnamon,"Cinnamon ( SIN-ə-mən) is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum.
Only 0.5 mm (0.02 in) of the inner bark is used; the outer, woody portion is discarded, leaving metre-long cinnamon strips that curl into rolls (""quills"") on drying.
verum bark harvested in Sri Lanka.Reviews of clinical trials reported lowering of fasting plasma glucose and inconsistent effects on hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c, an indicator of chronically elevated plasma glucose).
Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder.
It was imported to Egypt as early as 2000 BC, but those who reported that it had come from China had confused it with cinnamon cassia, a related species."
Colloidal Silver Products,Colloidal Silver Products,"There is no evidence that colloidal silver treats or prevents any medical condition, and it can cause serious and potentially irreversible side effects such as argyria.In August 1999, the U.S. FDA banned colloidal silver sellers from claiming any therapeutic or preventive value for the product, although silver-containing products continue to be promoted as dietary supplements in the U.S. under the looser regulatory standards applied to supplements.
In 2015 an English man was prosecuted and found guilty under the Cancer Act 1939 for selling colloidal silver with claims it could treat cancer.A 2014 systemic review concluded that using silver alloy‐coated catheters showed no significant difference in incidences of symptomatic Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) versus using standard catheters, although silver-alloy catheters seemed to cause less discomfort to patients.
They also raised concerns surrounding the unblinded nature of some of the studies then available.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2007 cleared an endotracheal tube with a fine coat of silver to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.A 2018 Cochrane review found that silver-containing dressings may increase the probability of healing for venous leg ulcers."
Cranberry,Cranberry,"It is possible that, given rising temperatures over the next 50 years, chilling temperatures for harvesting cranberries may be insufficient for the process.In 2016, world production of cranberry was 683,671 tonnes, mainly by the United States, Canada, and Chile, which collectively accounted for 98% of the global total (table).
Cranberries are also a major commercial crop in Massachusetts (23% of US production), New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington, as well as in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.The Cranberry Marketing Committee is an organization that represents United States cranberry growers in four marketing order districts.
Vaccinium macrocarpon or Oxycoccus macrocarpus (large cranberry, American cranberry, bearberry) native to northern North America across Canada, and eastern United States, south to North Carolina at high altitudes).
Cranberries are susceptible to false blossom, a harmful but controllable phytoplasma disease common in the eastern production areas of Massachusetts and New Jersey.Raw cranberries are 87% water, 12% carbohydrates, and contain negligible protein and fat (table)."
Dandelion,Dandelion,"Taraxacum () is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions.
'Vert de Montmagny' is a large-leaved, vigorous grower, which matures early.Dandelion has been used in traditional medicine in Europe, North America, and China.Media related to Taraxacum at Wikimedia CommonsThe entire plant, including the leaves, stems, flowers, and roots, is edible and nutritious.
The flowers of dandelions are typically eaten before they start to become seed heads, as although the fluffy ""parachutes"" are edible they are tasteless and their texture is considered unpleasant.The yellow flowers can be dried and ground into a yellow-pigmented powder which is used as a dye.The species of Taraxacum are tap-rooted, perennial, herbaceous plants, native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere."
Echinacea,Echinacea,"One of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of Echinacea products concluded that overall, ""adverse events are rare, mild and reversible,"" with the most common symptoms being ""gastrointestinal and skin-related."" Such side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, itch, and rash.
Echinacea pallida  – Pale purple coneflower
The generic name Echinacea is rooted in the Greek word ἐχῖνος (echinos), meaning hedgehog, in reference to the spiky appearance and feel of the flower heads.Echinacea products vary widely in composition.
Although there are multiple scientific reviews and meta-analyses published on the supposed immunological effects of Echinacea,  significant variability of products used among studies has limited conclusions about effects and safety, consequently leading to non-approval by regulatory authorities like the United States Food and Drug Administration of any health benefit or anti-disease activity.Echinacea angustifolia was widely used by the North American Plains Indians for its supposed medicinal qualities."
Ephedra,Ephedra,"In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004.
NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action.
Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements."
European Elder (Elderberry),European Elder (Elderberry),"Sambucus nigra is a species complex of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae native to most of Europe and North America.
Elder is cited as a poisonous plant for mammals, and as a weed in certain habitats.The plant is a very common feature of hedgerows and scrubland in Britain and northern Europe, but also is widely grown as an ornamental shrub or small tree.
Both the flowers and the berries have a long tradition of culinary use, primarily for cordial and wine.The Latin specific epithet nigra means ""black"", and refers to the deeply dark colour of the berries.
It is good cover for large and small mammals as well.There are several other closely related species, native to Asia and North America, which are similar, and sometimes treated as subspecies of Sambucus nigra.
caerulea.Except for the flowers and ripe berries (but including the ripe seeds), all parts of the plant are poisonous to mammals, containing the cyanogenic glycoside sambunigrin (C14H17NO6, CAS number 99-19-4)."
European Mistletoe,European Mistletoe,"Their parasitic lifestyle has led to some dramatic changes in their metabolism.The name mistletoe originally referred to the species Viscum album (European mistletoe, of the family Santalaceae in the order Santalales); it is the only species native to the British Isles and much of Europe.
A separate species, Viscum cruciatum, occurs in Southwest Spain and Southern Portugal, as well as Morocco (North Africa) and southern Africa.Over the centuries, the term has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different genera and even families—such as the Misodendraceae and the Loranthaceae.
In the popular roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, druids use mistletoe as the default focus item for casting spells.Mistletoe species grow on a wide range of host trees, some of which experience side effects including reduced growth, stunting, and loss of infested outer branches."
Evening Primrose Oil,Evening Primrose Oil,"If the seeds are used for pharmaceutical purposes it is also very important to grow the evening primrose without any pesticides to avoid any chemical residues.The oil of mature seeds contains approximately 7–10% of GLA.
Many conditions for which evening primrose oil is a traditional remedy or there is a theory suggesting efficacy are listed by the Mayo Clinic without comment.There are conflicting opinions and evidence for the medicinal effects of GLA.
The Mayo Clinic recommends caution in people with seizure disorders or mania, and by pregnant or breastfeeding women, and publishes a long list of possible side-effects.The whole plant and especially the leaves were boiled to tea by Native American tribes as a stimulant to treat laziness and against “over fatness”.
If soaked in water and boiled the taste is similar to black salsify root.The leaves of the evening primrose can be used from April to June when the plant is not flowering yet."
Fenugreek,Fenugreek,"Regular consumption of fenugreek increases the risk for serious medical side effects.Fresh fenugreek leaves are an ingredient in some curries, such as with potatoes in cuisines of the Indian subcontinent to make ""aloo methi"" (""potato fenugreek"") curry.
When harvested as greens, fenugreek is known as samudra methi in Maharashtra, especially in and around Mumbai, where it is often grown in sandy tracts near the sea, hence the name samudra, ""ocean"" in Sanskrit.
Sotolon is the chemical responsible for the distinctive maple syrup smell of fenugreek.Cuboid-shaped, yellow- to amber-coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently encountered in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, used both whole and powdered in the preparation of pickles, vegetable dishes, dal, and spice mixes such as panch phoron and sambar powder.
They are often roasted to reduce bitterness and enhance flavour.Fenugreek seeds and leaves contain the molecule sotolone, which imparts the aroma of fenugreek and curry in high concentrations, and maple syrup or caramel in lower concentrations."
Feverfew,Feverfew,"It usually is identified in the literature with its synonyms, Chrysanthemum parthenium and Pyrethrum parthenium.Feverfew is native to Eurasia, specifically the Balkan Peninsula, Anatolia, and the Caucasus, but cultivation has spread it around the world and it now is found in the rest of Europe, North America, and Chile.A perennial herb, it should be planted in full sun, 38 to 46 cm (15–18 in) apart, and cut back to the ground in the autumn.
A study found that the parthenolide content of these supplements bore little resemblance to the content claimed on the product labels.In August of 2019, ScienceDaily reported that researchers at the University of Birmingham announced that they had developed a method to produce parthenolide directly from the plants and a way of modifying that parthenolide to produce a number of compounds, both of which techniques seem promising to enable clinical research into the potential of feverfew for medical applications.Long-term use of feverfew followed by abrupt discontinuation may induce a withdrawal syndrome featuring rebound headaches and muscle and joint pains."
Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil,Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil,"Owing to its polymer-forming properties, linseed oil can be used on its own or blended with combinations of other oils, resins or solvents as an impregnator, drying oil finish or varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty, and in the manufacture of linoleum.
Linseed oil use has declined over the past several decades with increased availability of synthetic alkyd resins—which function similarly but resist yellowing.Linseed oil is an edible oil in demand as a nutritional supplement, as a source of α-Linolenic acid, (an omega-3 fatty acid).
Alpha linolenic acid (ALA) while bound to flaxseed ALA can withstand temperatures up to 175 °C (350 °F) for two hours.Food-grade flaxseed oil is cold-pressed, obtained without solvent extraction, in the absence of oxygen, and marketed as edible flaxseed oil.
The durability of putty is owed to the drying properties of linseed oil.When used as a wood finish, linseed oil dries slowly and shrinks little upon hardening."
Garlic,Garlic,"Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.Garlic is native to Central Asia and northeastern Iran, and has long been a common seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use.
Single clove garlic (also called pearl or solo garlic) originated in the Yunnan province of China.Garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Latin America.
Like chlorophyll, the pyrrole pigments are safe to eat.Upon cutting, similar to a color change in onion caused by reactions of amino acids with sulfur compounds, garlic can turn green.The sticky juice within the bulb cloves is used as an adhesive in mending glass and porcelain.
Additionally, the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries.Inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the ""skin"" covering each clove and root cluster."
Ginger,Ginger,"The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste.The characteristic fragrance and flavor of ginger result from volatile oils that compose 1-3% of the weight of fresh ginger, primarily consisting of zingerone, shogaols, and gingerols with [6]-gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) as the major pungent compound.
Shagoals are more pungent and have higher antioxidant activity but not found in raw ginger, but is formed from gingerols during heating, storage or via acidity.Fresh ginger also contains an enzyme zingibain which is a cysteine protease and has similar properties to rennet.Domesticated plants and animals of AustronesiaIn 2016, global production of ginger was 3.3 million tonnes, led by India with 34% of the world total.
The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.
Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called jahe, as a common ingredient in local recipes."
Ginkgo,Ginkgo,"The order to which it belongs, Ginkgoales, first appeared in the Permian, 270 million years ago, possibly derived from ""seed ferns"" of the order Peltaspermales, and now only contains this single genus and species.
The rate of evolution within the genus has been slow, and almost all its species had become extinct by the end of the Pliocene; the exception is the sole living species, Ginkgo biloba, which is only found in the wild in China, but is cultivated across the world.
Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day G.
Ginkgo evolved in an era before flowering plants, when ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming a low, open, shrubby canopy."
Goldenseal,Goldenseal,"However, there is no evidence that it has any therapeutic benefit, and it can be harmful, potentially causing death.A second species from Japan, previously listed as Hydrastis palmatum, is now usually classified in another genus, as Glaucidium palmatum.Goldenseal contains the isoquinoline alkaloids hydrastine, berberine, berberastine, hydrastinine, tetrahydroberberastine, canadine and canalidine.
The herb seems to have synergistic antibacterial activity over berberine in vitro, possibly as a result of efflux pump inhibitory activity.As of 1998, only 2.4% of goldenseal plant material originated from a cultivated source rather than wild harvest, although that number was projected to rise by 15–30% over the next several years.
Their research also showed that three to five years of growth will yield the highest concentration of alkaloids in the plant.Two experiments done by Sinclair and Catling on the effects of soil turnover, fertilization and transplanting of goldenseal show that disturbances actually benefit the growth of goldenseal."
Grape Seed Extract,Grape Seed Extract,"Generally, grape seed extract quality contains 95% procyanidins, but potency varies among products..
Eating foods or beverages high in procyanidin results in the sensation of the mouth puckering and dehydration, otherwise known as astringency, as felt after certain alcoholic drinks.A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials concluded that grape seed extract, in a dose of under 800 milligrams per day over at least 8 weeks, significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, although the amounts were small (3–6 mmHg) and occurred only in obese people under age 50 with existing metabolic syndrome and hypertension.
An earlier meta-analysis reported lower systolic blood pressure and heart rate, with no effect on blood lipids or C-reactive protein levels.The US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health reported that oral administration of grape seed extract (dose and frequency unreported) was well tolerated in people over 14 weeks."
Green Tea,Green Tea,"Today, Japan's most expensive premium teas are still grown in Uji. The largest tea-producing area today is Shizuoka Prefecture, which accounts for 40% of total Japanese sencha production.
Because of the high cost of labor in Japan, only the highest quality teas are plucked and processed by hand in the traditional fashion.Japanese green teas have a thin, needle-like shape and a rich, dark green color.
Bottled tea and tea-flavored food products usually use lower-grade Japanese-style tea produced in China.Although a variety of commercial tea cultivars exist in Japan, the vast majority of Japanese tea is produced using the Yabukita cultivar developed in the 1950s.Popular Japanese green teas include:
While Chinese green tea was originally steamed, as it still is in Japan, after the early Ming dynasty it has typically been processed by being pan-fired in a dry wok."
Hawthorn,Crataegus,"Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America.
It is graft-compatible with Mespilus (medlar), and with pear, and makes a hardier rootstock than quince, but the thorny suckering habit of the hawthorn can be problematic.Seedlings of Crataegus monogyna have been used to graft multiple species on the same trunk, such as pink hawthorn, pear tree, and medlar, the result being trees which give pink and white flowers in May and fruits during the summer.
Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in herbal medicine where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function.The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used black hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: kaǂa; approximate pronunciation: kasha) for food, and red hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: ǂupǂi; approximate pronunciation: shupshi) in traditional medicine.Overdose can cause cardiac arrhythmia and low blood pressure, while milder side effects include nausea and dizziness."
Hoodia,Hoodia,"Hoodia (; known locally as ""ghaap"" or ""bobbejaanghaap"")  is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae, under the subfamily Asclepiadoideae, native to Southern Africa.One species of Hoodia in particular, Hoodia gordonii, has achieved a degree of fame and controversy, after being investigated for use as a possible appetite suppressant.Media related to Hoodia at Wikimedia Commons
In 2006, the plant became internationally known, after a marketing campaign falsely claimed that its use as a dietary supplement was an appetite suppressant for weight loss.
In 2003, the South African San Council entered into a benefit sharing agreement with CSIR in which they would receive from 6 to 8% of the revenue from the sale of Ho. gordonii products, money which would be deposited in a trust for all San peoples across Southern Africa.The group was first described as a genus in 1844.Hoodia are stem succulents, described as ""cactiform"" because of their remarkable similarity to the unrelated cactus family."
Horse Chestnut,Horse Chestnut,"However, it can be found in many parts of Europe as far north as Gästrikland in Sweden, as well as in many parks and cities in the United States and Canada.Quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside, a flavonol glycoside can also be found in horse chestnut seeds.
Usually only 1–5 fruits develop on each panicle; the shell is a green, spiky capsule containing one (rarely two or three) nut-like seeds called conkers or horse-chestnuts.
Another is the risk of acute renal failure, ""when patients, who had undergone cardiac surgery were given high doses of horse chestnut extract i.v. for postoperative oedema.
No signs of development of renal impairment in the patients with normal renal function or of worsening of renal function in the patients with renal impairment were recorded."" It is concluded that aescin has excellent tolerability in a clinical setting.Raw Horse Chestnut seed, leaf, bark and flower are toxic due to the presence of esculin and should not be ingested."
Kava,Kava,"However, consumption of kava extracts produced with organic solvents, or excessive amounts of poor quality kava products, may be linked to an increased risk of adverse health outcomes, including potential liver injury.Fresh kava root contains on average 80% water.
Changes in the activity of 5-HT neurons could explain the sleep-inducing action  However, failure of the GABAA receptor inhibitor flumazenil to reverse the anxiolytic effects of kava in mice suggests that benzodiazepine-like effects are not contributing to the pharmacological profile of kava extracts.Heavy, long-term use of kava has been found to be free of association with reduced ability in saccade and cognitive tests, but has been associated with elevated liver enzymes.The nature of effects will largely depend on the strain of the kava plant and the form of its consumption."
Lavender,Lavender,"Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 47 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae.
The most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the flowers of this species.
They can also be used to make a tea that is milder than teas made with the flowers.The most common form in cultivation is the common or English lavender Lavandula angustifolia (formerly named L.
English lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) yields an oil with sweet overtones, and can be used in balms, salves, perfumes, cosmetics, and topical applications.
Lavandula × intermedia, also known as lavandin or Dutch lavender, yields a similar essential oil, but with higher levels of terpenes including camphor, which add a sharper overtone to the fragrance.
The essential oil was used in hospitals during World War I.Culinary lavender is usually English lavender, the most commonly used species in cooking (L."
Licorice Root,Licorice Root,"Liquorice (British English) or licorice (American English) ( LIK-ər-is(h)) is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a sweet flavour can be extracted.
It is usually spelled ""liquorice"" in Commonwealth usage, but ""licorice"" in the United States.Liquorice flavour is found in a wide variety of candies or sweets.
Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in Europe, but are also popular in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.In the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (drop) is one of the most popular forms of sweets.
Countries producing liquorice include India, Iran, Italy, Afghanistan, the People’s Republic of China, Pakistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Turkey.The world's leading manufacturer of liquorice products is M&F Worldwide, which manufactures more than 70% of the worldwide liquorice flavours sold to end users.Liquorice is an extract from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant which contains glycyrrhizic acid, or GZA.
Liquorice extract is often found in sweets and many candies, some drugs, and beverages like root beer."
Milk Thistle,Milk Thistle,"This fairly typical thistle has red to purple flowers and shiny pale green leaves with white veins.
Originally a native of Southern Europe through to Asia, it is now found throughout the world.Traditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin.
Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is a thorny plant presenting decorative leaves with a white pattern of veins and purple flower heads.
The spiny bracts on the flower head were eaten in the past like globe artichoke, and the stems (after peeling) can be soaked overnight to remove bitterness and then stewed.
The achenes are black, with a simple long white pappus, surrounded by a yellow basal ring.Milk thistle has been used for a number of purposes including treatment of liver disease, prevention and treatment of cancer, and supportive treatment of poisoning from death cap mushrooms; however, clinical study results were described as heterogeneous and contradictory.
A 2007 Cochrane Review included eighteen randomized clinical trials which assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases."
Noni,"Novi Grad, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Novi Grad (Serbian Cyrillic: Нови Град), previously Bosanski Novi, is a town and municipality in Republika Srpska, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Known for its scenic quay, Novi Grad lies at the confluence of the Una and Sana rivers.
Official websiteNovi Grad is located on the right bank of the Una and both banks of the Sana, between two geographic zones: the slopes of the mountains of Grmeč and Kozara, and the alluvial land surrounding the town's two rivers.
Its governed municipality covers an area of 470 km2 (180 sq mi).According to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 27,115 inhabitants.There are several active sports organizations in the town, including football, handball and basketball clubs.
In order to distance the town from its Bosnian history and its cultural roots and in tune with the war politics, the local Serb government renamed the town to Novi Grad, a change criticized by Croat and Bosniak residents."
Omega-3 Supplements: An Introduction,Dietary supplement,"In 2017, the American Heart Association issued a science advisory stating that it could not recommend use of omega-3 fish oil supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease or stroke, although it reaffirmed supplementation for people who have a history of coronary heart disease.In the United States, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 provides this description: ""The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) defines the term “dietary supplement” to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients."
Peppermint Oil,Peppermint Oil,"Mentha piperita and Mentha haplocalyx are both recognized as plant sources of menthol and menthone and are among the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.Peppermint generally grows best in moist, shaded locations, and expands by underground rhizomes.
It is known to repel some pest insects, including mosquitos, and has uses in organic gardening.The chemical composition of the essential oil from peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) was analyzed by GC/FID and GC-MS.
Argentina accounted for 8% of the world total.In the United States, Oregon and Washington produce most of the country's peppermint, the leaves of which are processed for the essential oil to produce flavorings mainly for chewing gum and toothpaste.ISO 676:1995 - contains the information about the nomenclature of the variety and cultivars
ISO 5563:1984 - a specification for its dried leaves of Mentha piperita Linnaeus
Peppermint oil - ISO 856:2006A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use:"
Pomegranate,Pomegranate,"Pomegranates symbolize the mystical experience in the Jewish mystical tradition, or kabbalah, with the typical reference being to entering the ""garden of pomegranates"" or pardes rimonim; this is also the title of a book by the 16th-century mystic Moses ben Jacob Cordovero.Compared to the pulp, the inedible pomegranate peel contains as much as three times the total amount of polyphenols, including condensed tannins, catechins, gallocatechins and prodelphinidins.The higher phenolic content of the peel yields extracts for use in dietary supplements and food preservatives.The pomegranate (known as ""anār"" انار  in Urdu) is a popular fruit in Pakistan."
Probiotics: In Depth,Probiotics: In Depth,"IBD is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function.Inflammatory bowel disease-22Medical treatment of IBD is individualised to each patient.
Biological therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, especially the TNF inhibitors, are used in people with more severe or resistant Crohn's disease and sometimes in ulcerative colitis.Treatment is usually started by administering drugs with high anti-inflammatory effects, such as prednisone.
Gluten sensitivity was reported in 23.6 and 27.3% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively.A diet high in protein, particularly animal protein, may be associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease and relapses.In spite of Crohn's and UC being very different diseases, both may present with any of the following symptoms: abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, severe internal cramps/muscle spasms in the region of the pelvis and weight loss."
Red Clover,Red Clover,"Trifolium pratense, the red clover, is a herbaceous species of flowering plant in the bean family Fabaceae, native to Europe, Western Asia, and northwest Africa, but planted and naturalised in many other regions.Red-clover seed production in the Intermountain States hosted by the UNT Government Documents Department
List of ineffective cancer treatmentsThe red clover is native to Europe, Western Asia, and northwest Africa, but it has been naturalized in other continents, like North and South America.
doi:10.1111/pbr.12224.Trifolium pratense is the national flower of Denmark and the state flower of Vermont.Trifolium pratense is used in traditional medicine of India as deobstruent, antispasmodic, expectorant, sedative, anti-inflammatory and antidermatosis agent.In alternative medicine, red clover is promoted as a treatment for a variety of human maladies, including symptoms of menopause, coughs, disorders of the lymphatic system and a variety of cancers."
Red Yeast Rice: An Introduction,Red Yeast Rice: An Introduction,"If fermentation is unintentionally stopped, such as when the yeasts become exhausted of available nutrients and the wine has not yet reached dryness, this is considered a stuck fermentation.The most common yeast associated with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae which has been favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and sulfur dioxide as well as its ability to thrive in normal wine pH between 2.8 and 4.
Not only could this unpredictability include the presence of off-flavors/aromas and higher volatile acidity but also the potential for a stuck fermentation if the indigenous yeast strains are not vigorous enough to fully convert all the sugars.It is virtually inevitable that non-Saccharomyces wild yeast will have a role in beginning the fermentation of virtually every wine but for the wineries that choose to allow these yeasts to continue fermenting versus minimizing their influence do so with the intent of enhancing complexity through bio-diversity."
S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe): An Introduction,S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe): An Introduction,"The fluorinase enzyme (EC 2.5.1.63, also known as adenosyl-fluoride synthase) catalyzes the reaction between fluoride ion and the co-factor S-adenosyl-L-methionine to generate L-methionine and 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine, the first committed product of the fluorometabolite biosynthesis pathway.
A homologous chlorinase enzyme, which catalyses the same reaction with chloride rather than fluoride ion, has been isolated from Salinospora tropica, from the biosynthetic pathway of salinosporamide A.
The reaction catalysed by the fluorinase is reversible, and upon incubation of 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyadenosine and L-methionine with the fluorinase, SAM and fluoride ion are produced.
While the equilibrium for reaction between SAM and fluoride ion lies towards products FDA and L-methionine, the equilibrium position is reversed in the case for chloride ion.
Incubation of SAM and chloride ion with the fluorinase does not result in generation of 5'-chloro-5'-deoxyadenosine (ClDA), unless an additional enzyme, an L-amino acid oxidase, is added.
Incubation of 5'-chloro nucleosides with the enzyme, along with catalytic L-selenomethionine or L-methionine results in the production of 5-fluoro nucleosides."
Sage,Salvia officinalis,"Salvia officinalis (sage, also called garden sage, common sage, or culinary sage) is a perennial, evergreen subshrub, with woody stems, grayish leaves, and blue to purplish flowers.
'Tricolor', a cultivar with white, purple and green variegated leaves'Icterina' and 'Purpurascens' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.Some research has suggested certain extracts of salvia officinalis may have positive effects on human brain function, but due to significant methodological problems, no firm conclusions can be drawn.
Modern cultivars include leaves with purple, rose, cream, and yellow in many variegated combinations.In Britain, sage has for generations been listed as one of the essential herbs, along with parsley, rosemary, and thyme (as in the folk song ""Scarborough Fair"").
Despite the common use of traditional and available herbs in French cuisine, sage never found favor there.
The specific epithet officinalis refers to plants with a well-established medicinal or culinary value."
Saw Palmetto,Saw Palmetto,"It is marketed as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but reviews of clinical trials, including those conducted by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, found it ineffective for this purpose.Saw Palmetto NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative HealthSaw palmetto extract may decrease the effectiveness of estrogen products by reducing estrogen levels in the body via its antiestrogenic effects.
Saw palmetto extract should also be avoided during breastfeeding due to a lack of available information.In a case report, a patient taking saw palmetto extract had increased bleeding time during surgery.
One clinical trial pre-treated prostate surgery patients with saw palmetto for five weeks prior to the surgery, because there was evidence from earlier literature that such pre-treatment reduced operative bleeding."
Soy,Soy,"For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.Soy beans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins.
Soybeans were probably first cultivated in Canada by 1855, and definitely in 1895 at Ontario Agricultural College.It was not until Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Burr Osborne showed that the nutritional value of soybean seeds could be increased by cooking, moisture or heat, that soy went from a farm animal feed to a human food.William Morse is considered the ""father"" of modern soybean agriculture in America.
The soy-based meat substitute textured vegetable protein has been used for more than 50 years as a way of inexpensively extending ground beef without reducing its nutritional value.Soybeans contain a high level of phytic acid, which has many effects including acting as an antioxidant and a chelating agent."
St. John's Wort,St. John's Wort,"Horses may show signs of anorexia, depression (with a comatose state), dilated pupils, and injected conjunctiva.The specific epithet perforatum is Latin, referring to the perforated appearance of the plant's leaves.Hypericin, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin may be quantitated in plasma as confirmation of usage and to estimate the dosage.
In response to hyperforin's incorporation into a new bath oil, a study to assess potential skin irritation was conducted which found good skin tolerance of St John's wort.It is probable that Hypericum perforatum originated as a hybrid between two closely related species with subsequent doubling of chromosomes.
A 2008 Cochrane review of 29 clinical trials concluded that it was superior to placebo in patients with major depression, as effective as standard antidepressants and had fewer side-effects.In the United States, St John's wort is considered a dietary supplement by the FDA, and is not regulated by the same standards as a prescription drug."
Tea Tree Oil,Tea Tree Oil,"It is poisonous if consumed by mouth, and unsafe to use on children.Tea tree oil has been used in traditional medicine in the belief it treats acne, nail fungus, or athlete's foot, with little evidence to support these uses.
It is not recommended for treating head lice in children because its safety has not been established and it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.Tea tree oil is defined by the International Standard ISO 4730 (""Oil of Melaleuca, terpinen-4-ol type""), containing terpinen-4-ol, γ-terpinene, and α-terpinene as about 70% to 90% of whole oil, while ρ-cymene, terpinolene, α-terpineol, and α-pinene collectively account for some 15% of the oil (table, right).
A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil on children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, and because of a lack of knowledge about safety and effectiveness.Tea tree oil is poisonous when taken internally."
Thunder God Vine,Thunder God Vine,"Evidence is insufficient to deem it effective as a method of birth control.The United Kingdom government does not recommend the use of Tripterygium due to potential side effects.At medicinal doses, T.
In August 2011, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency published a drug safety bulletin advising consumers not to use medicines containing lei gong teng due to potentially serious side effects.China State Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in April 2012 about this medicine, urging caution.A 2016 review found gastrointestinal symptoms in 13%, adverse reproductive outcomes in 12%, adverse skin reactions in 8%, hematologic events in 6.5%, cardiovascular events in 5%.
Triptolide has pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, immune modulation, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic activity, but its clinical use is limited by severe toxicity.Evidence is lacking that Tripterygium is either safe or effective as a method of birth control in men."
Turmeric,Turmeric,"The rhizomes are used fresh or boiled in water and dried, after which they are ground into a deep orange-yellow powder commonly used as a coloring and flavoring agent in many Asian cuisines, especially for curries, as well as for dyeing.
Turmeric powder has a warm, bitter, black pepper-like flavor and earthy, mustard-like aroma.Although long used in Ayurvedic medicine, where it is also known as haridra, no high-quality clinical evidence exists for therapeutic use of turmeric or its constituent, curcumin.Turmeric is a perennial herbaceous plant that reaches up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall.
The bracts are light green and ovate to oblong with a blunt upper end with a length of 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in).Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods."
Valerian,Valerian,"Crude extract of valerian root may have sedative and anxiolytic effects, and is commonly sold in dietary supplement capsules to promote sleep.Valerian is considered an invasive species in many jurisdictions, including the US state of Connecticut where it is officially banned, and in New Brunswick, Canada where it is listed as a plant of concern.Because the compounds in valerian produce central nervous system depression, they should not be used with other depressants, such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, kava, or antihistamine drugs.
Valerenic acid in valerian stimulates serotonin receptors as a partial agonist, including 5-HT5A which is implicated in the sleep-wake cycle.Valerian is unusual in having flowers with ""handedness"", that is, having neither radial nor bilateral symmetry.The name of the herb is derived from the personal name Valeria and the Latin verb valere (to be strong, healthy)."
Yohimbe,Yohimbe,"Yohimbine (), also known as quebrachine, and not to be confused with yohimbe, is a indoloquinolizidine alkaloid derived from the bark of the African tree Pausinystalia johimbe; also from the bark of the unrelated South American tree Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco.
Substances which have purported to be extracts from the yohimbe tree have been marketed as dietary supplements for various purposes, but they contain highly variable amounts of yohimbine, if any; no published scientific evidence supports their efficacy.Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco is an unrelated tree whose common name is quebracho blanco.
According to yet another source the yohimbe sold in markets in West Africa, where the tree grows, is frequently adulterated with other species of the genus Pausinystalia; these contain little yohimbine.
Others include rauwolscine, corynanthine and ajmalicine; the bark also contains non-alkaloids about which virtually nothing is known.Yohimbe, thus a complex mixture, has been studied far less thoroughly than yohimbine, the pure compound."
