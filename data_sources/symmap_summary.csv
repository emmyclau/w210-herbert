Abrus Precatorius L.,Abrus Precatorius L.,"This is done by means of small spikes, called sui (needles) or sutari (awls), which are prepared by soaking the awl in a thin paste of the water-soaked, pounded seeds, and then drying the weapon in the sun, after which it is oiled and sharpened upon stone, affixed in a handle, and then used to puncture the skin of the animal.
Once Abrus precatorius plants have grown to maturity under favourable conditions, their deep roots are extremely difficult to remove, and the plants' aggressive growth, hard-shelled seeds, and ability to sucker, renders an infestation extremely difficult to eradicate and makes it very difficult to prevent re-infestation.
Under the name of ""Jequirity"" the seeds have recently been employed in cases of ophthalmia, a use to which they have long been put in India and Brazil.""The plant is also used in Ayurveda and is said to promote hair growth.

Actinidia Chinensis Planch,Actinidia Chinensis Planch,"Actinidia chinensis (Planch.) is a fruit producing vine, one of some 40 related species of the genus, Actinidia, native to China.
A. chinensis is a variety closely related to Actinidia deliciosa – and is the source of the common commercial kiwifruit.
Fruit colour may vary from green to lime green or gold, depending on breeding.The fruits – about the size of a chicken egg – are edible, providing a rich source of vitamin C and dietary fiber.The origin of Actinidia chinensis is from Hubei or Sichuan, China exported to New Zealand in 1904.
One of the most attractive varieties has a red 'iris' around the centre of the fruit and yellow flesh outside.
A commercially viable variety of this red-ringed kiwifruit, patented as EnzaRed, is a cultivar of the Chinese hong yang variety.'Hort16A' is a golden kiwifruit cultivar marketed worldwide, first as Zespri Gold, then as SunGold."

Benzoinum,Benzoin (organic compound),"Benzoin ( or ) is an organic compound with the formula PhCH(OH)C(O)Ph.
Benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation.
The main component in these natural products is benzoic acid.The main uses of benzoin are as a precursor to benzil, which is a photoinitiator.
The conversion proceeds by organic oxidation using copper(II), nitric acid, or oxone.
In one study, this reaction is carried out with atmospheric oxygen and basic alumina in dichloromethane.Benzoin can be used in the preparation of several pharmaceutical drugs including oxaprozin, ditazole, and phenytoin.Benzoin synthesis, Organic Syntheses, Coll.
33 (1921)Benzoin is prepared from benzaldehyde via the benzoin condensation.Benzoin was first reported in 1832 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Woehler during their research on oil of bitter almond, which is benzaldehyde with traces of hydrocyanic acid.
The catalytic synthesis by the benzoin condensation was improved by Nikolay Zinin during his time with Liebig."
Bombyx Mori L.,Bombyx Mori L.,"Sericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China, whence it spread to India, Korea, Japan, and the West.
mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.Domestic silkmoths are very different from most members in the genus Bombyx; not only have they lost the ability to fly, but their color pigments have also been lost.In the U.S., teachers may sometimes introduce the insect life cycle to their students by raising domestic silkmoths in the classroom as a science project.
The major objectives are improving fecundity (the egg-laying capacity of a breed), the health of larvae, quantity of cocoon and silk production, and disease resistance.
At least 70 million pounds of raw silk are produced each year, requiring nearly 10 billion cocoons.The full genome of the domestic silkmoth was published in 2008 by the International Silkworm Genome Consortium."
Borneolum syntheticum,Gou pi gao,"Gou Pi Gao, translated word for word, literally means dog skin plaster, which is indicative of its history.Gou Pi Gao was traditionally literally a dog skin plaster, with herbal medicines smeared onto a dog skin.
In addition, modern chemicals are often added to the adhesive ""herbal"" mixture on the plaster, including ingredients such as menthol and camphor.Gou Pi Gao can be used to treat primarily muscle and tendon pains, caused by muscle sprains, tears, rheumatism, tendinitis and various other conditions.
The adhesive plaster is applied to the area in pain, and left on for 3–5 hours (preferably with heat treatment in order to increase the medicine's effectiveness).
Afterwards, it is removed, and the skin is left to rest for 2–3 hours, after which the Gou Pi Gao is reapplied.
Certain medical conditions, such as pregnancy, may result in a higher risk factor in taking the medicine, and one should contact his/her doctor to prevent the risk of complications."

Caulis Sinomenii,Reuptake enhancer,"A reuptake enhancer (RE), also sometimes referred to as a reuptake activator, is a type of reuptake modulator which enhances the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron, leading to a decrease in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and therefore a decrease in neurotransmission.
The antidepressant tianeptine was once claimed to be a (selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer (SRE or SSRE), but the role of serotonin reuptake in its mechanism is doubtful.
Tianeptine has no affinity for the serotonin transporter, neither increases nor decreases extracellular levels of serotonin in cortico-limbic structures of conscious rats, and it didn't show any other long-term effect on the serotonin pathway.
Thus, tianeptine's role as an SSRE may have been the coincidence of a yet unknown mechanism of action.

Dictamni Cortex,Dictamni Cortex,"Distribution of this group of alkaloids is essentially limited to plant family Rutaceae.
The simplest member of this group is dictamnine and most widespread member is skimmianine.A furoquinoline alkaloid, dictamnine, is very common within the family Rutaceae.
Another furoquinoline alkaloid, skimmianine, has strong antiacetylcholinesterase activity.Thomas first isolated dictamnine from Rutaceae in 1923.
Skimmianine, another common furoquinoline alkaloid also shows a very similar type of chemistry to dictamine.
Skimmianine also has a linear structure as it gave 3-ethyl-4,7,8-trimethoxy-2-quinolone from hydrolysis.Media related to Furoquinolines at Wikimedia CommonsSome furoquinoline alkaloids have been found to have in vitro pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, antiviral, mutagenic and cytotoxic activities.
Furoquinoline alkaloids extracted from Teclea afzelii (Rutaceae) plants, collected at Elounden, centre province of Cameroon, have antiplasmodial activities.
Another study shows that some furoquinoline alkaloids have in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum, one of the species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans."

Ginkgo Folium,Ginkgo Folium,"While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain.
Ginkgo, therefore, presents an ""ecological paradox"" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity).Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1771, the specific epithet biloba derived from the Latin bis, ""two"" and loba, ""lobed"", referring to the shape of the leaves."

The genus is one of the best studied examples of cryptic species pairs due to morphological convergence within the marine macroalgae.
Some species grow so vigorously in tropical lagoons that the sediment is composed solely of the remains of their tissues, forming a calcareous ""Halimeda sand"".

Sedum Aizoon L.,Sedum Aizoon L.,"Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops.
Various attempts have been made to subdivide this large genus, in addition to segregating separate genera, including creation of informal groups, sections, series and subgenera.
Sedum includes 54 species native to Europe, which Berger classified into 27 series.
Although the genus has been greatly reduced, from about 600 to 420–470 species, by forming up to 32 segregate genera, it still constitutes a third of the family and is polyphyletic.Sedum species are found in four of six major crown clades wthin subfamily Sempervivoideae of Crassulaceae and are allocated to tribes, as follows:

Semen Ginkgo,Sperm,"Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing sperm cells, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases sperm cell-derived chromosomal aberrations.

The achenes are black, with a simple long white pappus, surrounded by a yellow basal ring.Milk thistle has been used for a number of purposes including treatment of liver disease, prevention and treatment of cancer, and supportive treatment of poisoning from death cap mushrooms; however, clinical study results were described as heterogeneous and contradictory.
A 2007 Cochrane Review included eighteen randomized clinical trials which assessed milk thistle in 1088 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C virus liver diseases."

Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French (a Romance language) and later just native or other languages.Some Latin verbs are deponent, causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum (to urge).Throughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles."

fructus Foeniculi,Fennel,"Dried fennel fruit is an aromatic, anise-flavored spice, brown or green in color when fresh, slowly turning a dull grey as the fruit ages.
Emperor Charlemagne required the cultivation of fennel on all imperial farms.Many species in the family Apiaceae or Umbelliferae are superficially similar to fennel, and some, such as poison hemlock, are toxic, so it is unwise, and potentially extremely dangerous, to use any part of any of these plants as a herb or vegetable unless it can be positively identified as being edible.
Lomatium species tend to prefer dry rocky soils devoid of organic material.Fennel is widely cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, strongly flavored leaves and fruits.

Common fruits that are sometimes classified as epigynous berries include bananas, coffee, members of the genus Vaccinium (e.g., cranberries and blueberries), and members of the family Cucurbitaceae (gourds, cucumbers, melons and squash).Aggregate or compound fruits contain seeds from different ovaries of a single flower, with the individual ""fruitlets"" joined together at maturity to form the complete fruit.
