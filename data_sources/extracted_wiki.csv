"('activated charcoal', 'Uses')","Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.One major industrial application involves use of activated carbon in metal finishing for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is the main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon is used to treat poisonings and overdoses following oral ingestion. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and flatulence. However, activated charcoal shows no effect on intestinal gas and diarrhea, and is, ordinarily, medically ineffective if poisoning resulted from ingestion of corrosive agents such as alkalis and strong acids, iron, boric acid, lithium, petroleum products, or alcohol. Activated carbon will not prevent these chemicals from being absorbed into the human body.It is particularly ineffective against poisonings of strong acids or alkali, cyanide, iron, lithium, arsenic, methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol.Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration, which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon, in 50% w/w combination with celite, is used as stationary phase in low-pressure chromatographic separation of carbohydrates (mono-, di-, tri-saccharides) using ethanol solutions (5 50%) as mobile phase in analytical or preparative protocols.
Activated carbon is useful for extracting the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban from blood plasma samples . For this purpose it has been made into ""minitablets"", each containing 5mg activated carbon for treating 1ml samples(DOAC Stop, www.haematex.com). Since this activated carbon has no effect on blood clotting factors, heparin or most other anticoagulants  this allows a plasma sample to be analyzed for abnormalities otherwise affected by the DOACs. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Carbon adsorption has numerous applications in removing pollutants from air or water streams both in the field and in industrial processes such as:

Spill cleanup
Groundwater remediation
Drinking water filtration
Air purification
Volatile organic compounds capture from painting, dry cleaning, gasoline dispensing operations, and other processes
Volatile organic compounds recovery (solvent recovery systems, SRU) from flexible packaging, converting, coating, and other processes.During early implementation of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act in the US, EPA officials developed a rule that proposed requiring drinking water treatment systems to use granular activated carbon. Because of its high cost, the so-called GAC rule encountered strong opposition across the country from the water supply industry, including the largest water utilities in California. Hence, the agency set aside the rule. Activated carbon filtration is an effective water treatment method due to its multi-functional nature. There are specific types of activated carbon filtration methods and equipment that are indicated   depending upon the contaminants involved.Activated carbon is also used for the measurement of radon concentration in air. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon (charcoal) is an allowed substance used by organic farmers in both livestock production and wine making. In livestock production it is used as a pesticide, animal feed additive, processing aid, nonagricultural ingredient and disinfectant.  In organic winemaking, activated carbon is allowed for use as a processing agent to adsorb brown color pigments from white grape concentrates.
It is sometimes used as biochar. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon filters (AC filters) can be used to filter vodka and whiskey of organic impurities which can affect color, taste, and odor. Passing an organically impure vodka through an activated carbon filter at the proper flow rate will result in vodka with an identical alcohol content and significantly increased organic purity, as judged by odor and taste. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Research is being done testing various activated carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas.  The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons have been able to achieve bonding energies of 5 10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work or in the case of hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on-board pressure tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Filters with activated carbon are usually used in compressed air and gas purification to remove oil vapors, odor, and other hydrocarbons from the air. The most common designs use a 1-stage or 2 stage filtration principle in which activated carbon is embedded inside the filter media.
Activated carbon filters are used to retain radioactive gases within the air vacuumed from a nuclear boiling water reactor turbine condenser. The large charcoal beds adsorb these gases and retain them while they rapidly decay to non-radioactive solid species. The solids are trapped in the charcoal particles, while the filtered air passes through. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon is commonly used on the laboratory scale to purify solutions of organic molecules containing unwanted colored organic impurities.
Filtration over activated carbon is used in large scale fine chemical and pharmaceutical processes for the same purpose. The carbon is either mixed with the solution then filtered off or immobilized in a filter. 
 Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in gas masks and respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride in dark and many other applications.Activated carbon, often infused with sulfur or iodine, is widely used to trap mercury emissions from coal-fired power stations, medical incinerators, and from natural gas at the wellhead. This carbon is a special product costing more than US$4.00 per kg.Since it is often not recycled, the mercury-laden activated carbon presents a disposal dilemma. If the activated carbon contains less than 260 ppm mercury, United States federal regulations allow it to be stabilized (for example, trapped in concrete) for landfilling. However, waste containing greater than 260 ppm is considered to be in the high-mercury subcategory and is banned from landfilling (Land-Ban Rule). This material is now accumulating in warehouses and in deep abandoned mines at an estimated rate of 100 tons per year.The problem of disposal of mercury-laden activated carbon is not unique to the United States. In the Netherlands, this mercury is largely recovered and the activated carbon is disposed of by complete burning, forming carbon dioxide (CO2).","Solutions,[sbst],27.65,C0037633|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Electroplating,[npop],12.88,C0013866|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Physical Phenomenon or Property,[npop],3.61,C0597237|Catabolism,[orgf],3.48,C0699900|Diarrhea,[sosy],29.46,C0011991|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Poisoning,[inpo],20.83,C0032343|Drug Overdose,[inpo],17.80,C0029944|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Dyspepsia,[sosy],14.64,C0013395|Flatulence,[sosy],14.64,C0016204|Lung,[bpoc],13.83,C0024109|Intestines,[bpoc],9.74,C0021853|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],11.49,C0033095|Solutions,[sbst],6.83,C0037633|Plasma,[bdsu],26.33,C0032105|Affect (mental function),[menp],9.83,C0001721|Congenital Abnormality,[cgab],6.74,C0000768|Air (substance),[sbst],32.74,C0001861|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.43,C0599638|Streams,[npop],16.30,C0442540|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.46,C0599638|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Desiccation,[npop],9.99,C0011682|Drinking Water,[sbst],44.97,C0599638|Gegenhalten,[fndg],19.33,C0231519|Air (substance),[sbst],16.30,C0001861|Multiple Chronic Conditions,[dsyn],16.03,C3266262|Set (Psychology),[menp],13.09,C0036849|Mental concentration,[menp],3.55,C0086045|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Disinfectants,[sbst],17.80,C0012682|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Pigmentation,[orga],13.01,C0031911|Taste Perception,[ortf],29.46,C0039336|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Odors,[npop],26.56,C0028884|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.87,C0080194|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Ability,[orga],26.61,C0085732|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],19.70,C0033095|Natural Gas,[sbst],17.80,C0017109|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Nevus,[neop],14.64,C0027960|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.14,C1096155|Fever,[sosy],13.06,C0015967|Pyschological Bonding,[menp],12.89,C0028758|Satisfaction,[menp],11.49,C0242428|Cells,[cell],3.63,C0007634|Air (substance),[sbst],32.35,C0001861|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Compressed Air,[sbst],19.41,C0337081|Odors,[npop],14.64,C0028884|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.87,C0162867|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.47,C0599638|Vacuum (physical force),[npop],19.28,C0042221|Air (substance),[sbst],16.05,C0001861|Radioactivity,[npop],13.38,C0034553|furuncle,[dsyn],3.51,C0242301|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Solutions,[sbst],6.72,C0037633|Solutions,[sbst],6.72,C0037633|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.56,C0080194|Water Purification,[acty],27.26,C0242719|Natural Gas,[sbst],16.26,C0017109|Air (substance),[sbst],16.12,C0001861|Employment Termination,[fndg],9.73,C0014007|"
"('activated charcoal', 'Modification of properties and reactivity')","Acid-base, oxidation-reduction and specific adsorption characteristics are strongly dependent on the composition of the surface functional groups.The surface of conventional activated carbon is reactive, capable of oxidation by atmospheric oxygen and oxygen plasma steam, and also carbon dioxide and ozone.Oxidation in the liquid phase is caused by a wide range of reagents (HNO3, H2O2, KMnO4).Through the formation of a large number of basic and acidic groups on the surface of oxidized carbon to sorption and other properties can differ significantly from the unmodified forms.Activated carbon can be nitrogenated by natural products or polymers or processing of carbon with nitrogenating reagents.Activated carbon can interact with chlorine, bromine and fluorine.Surface of activated carbon, like other carbon materials can be fluoralkylated by treatment with (per)fluoropolyether peroxide in a liquid phase, or with wide range of fluoroorganic substances by CVD-method. Such materials combine high hydrophobicity and chemical stability with electrical and thermal conductivity and can be used as electrode material for super capacitors.Sulfonic acid functional groups can be attached to activated carbon to give ""starbons"" which can be used to selectively catalyse the esterification of fatty acids. Formation of such activated carbons from halogenated precursors gives a more effective catalyst which is thought to be a result of remaining halogens improving stability. It is reported about synthesis of activated carbon with chemically grafted superacid sites  CF2SO3H.Some of the chemical properties of activated carbon have been attributed to presence of the surface active carbon double bond.The Polyani adsorption theory is a popular method for analyzing adsorption of various organic substances to their surface.","Plasma,[bdsu],12.94,C0032105|Electricity,[npop],12.90,C0013790|Oxidation-Reduction,[moft],11.49,C0030012|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Esterification,[npop],9.87,C0014895|Catalysis,[npop],8.34,C0007382|Transplanted tissue,[tisu],6.59,C0332835|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],3.68,C0007222|chemical properties,[npop],3.58,C0243178|"
"('activated charcoal', 'Reactivation and regeneration')","The reactivation or the regeneration of activated carbons involves restoring the adsorptive capacity of saturated activated carbon by desorbing adsorbed contaminants on the activated carbon surface.The most common regeneration technique employed in industrial processes is thermal reactivation. The thermal regeneration process generally follows three steps:
Adsorbent drying at approximately 105  C (221  F)
High temperature desorption and decomposition (500 900  C (932 1,652  F)) under an inert atmosphere
Residual organic gasification by a non-oxidising gas (steam or carbon dioxide) at elevated temperatures (800  C (1,470  F))The heat treatment stage utilises the exothermic nature of adsorption and results in desorption, partial cracking and polymerization of the adsorbed organics. The final step aims to remove charred organic residue formed in the porous structure in the previous stage and re-expose the porous carbon structure regenerating its original surface characteristics. After treatment the adsorption column can be reused. Per adsorption-thermal regeneration cycle between 5 15 wt% of the carbon bed is burnt off resulting in a loss of adsorptive capacity. Thermal regeneration is a high energy process due to the high required temperatures making it both an energetically and commercially expensive process. Plants that rely on thermal regeneration of activated carbon have to be of a certain size before it is economically viable to have regeneration facilities onsite. As a result, it is common for smaller waste treatment sites to ship their activated carbon cores to specialised facilities for regeneration. 
 The reactivation or the regeneration of activated carbons involves restoring the adsorptive capacity of saturated activated carbon by desorbing adsorbed contaminants on the activated carbon surface.Current concerns with the high energy/cost nature of thermal regeneration of activated carbon has encouraged research into alternative regeneration methods to reduce the environmental impact of such processes. Though several of the regeneration techniques cited have remained areas of purely academic research, some alternatives to thermal regeneration systems have been employed in industry. Current alternative regeneration methods are:

Chemical and solvent regeneration

High cholesterol. Taking alfalfa seeds seems to lower total cholesterol and  bad  low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in people with high cholesterol levels.
Kidney problems
Bladder problems
Prostate problems
Asthma
Arthritis
Diabetes
Upset stomach
Other conditionsFurther, the US NIH has identified several safety concerns and medication interactions.
US NIH summarizes: 

Alfalfa leaves are POSSIBLY SAFE for most adults. However, taking alfalfa seeds long-term is LIKELY UNSAFE. Alfalfa seed products may cause reactions that are similar to the autoimmune disease called lupus erythematosus.
Alfalfa might also cause some people's skin to become extra sensitive to the sun.

As noted above, raw unsprouted alfalfa has toxic effects in primates, including humans, which can result in lupus-like symptoms and other immunological diseases in susceptible individuals,US NIH calls out special precautions and warnings for the following:
Pregnancy or breast-feeding: Using alfalfa in amounts larger than what is commonly found in food is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. There is some evidence that alfalfa may act like estrogen, and this might affect the pregnancy.
Auto-immune Diseases: Alfalfa might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of these diseases.
Hormone-sensitive conditions (such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids:) Alfalfa might have the same effects as the female hormone estrogen.
Diabetes: Alfalfa might lower blood sugar levels.
Kidney transplant: There is one report of a kidney transplant rejection following the three-month use of a supplement that contained alfalfa and black cohosh. This outcome is more likely due to alfalfa than black cohosh. Alfalfa's immune system boost might make the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine less effective.US NIH warns that alfalfa interacts with Warfarin (Coumadin) in a major way; the two should not be combined.US NIH warns that alfalfa interacts with the following medicine types moderately; the user should be cautious when taking alfalfa with these:
Birth control pills (Contraceptive drugs)
Estrogens   Large amounts of alfalfa might have some of the same effects as estrogen. However even large amounts of alfalfa are not as strong as estrogen pills. Taking alfalfa along with estrogen pills might decrease the effects of estrogen pills.
Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)

"('belladonna', 'Toxicity')","Belladonna is one of the most toxic plants found, and its use by mouth increases risk in numerous clinical conditions, such as complications of pregnancy, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders, among others. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids. Roots have up to 1.3%, leaves 1.2%, stalks 0.65%, flowers 0.6%, ripe berries 0.7%, and seeds 0.4% tropane alkaloids; leaves reach maximal alkaloid content when the plant is budding and flowering, roots are most poisonous in the end of the plant's vegetation period. Belladonna nectar is transformed by bees into honey that also contains tropane alkaloids. The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. The root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another.The active agents in belladonna, atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine), and hyoscyamine, have anticholinergic properties. The symptoms of belladonna poisoning include dilated pupils, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, tachycardia, loss of balance, staggering, headache, rash, flushing, severely dry mouth and throat, slurred speech, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and convulsions.  In 2009, A. belladonna berries were mistaken for blueberries by an adult woman; the six berries she ate were documented to result in severe anticholinergic syndrome. The plant's deadly symptoms are caused by atropine's disruption of the parasympathetic nervous system's ability to regulate involuntary activities, such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The antidote for belladonna poisoning is an anticholinesterase (such as physostigmine or pilocarpine), the same as for atropine.Atropa belladonna is also toxic to many domestic animals, causing narcosis and paralysis. However, cattle and rabbits eat the plant seemingly without suffering harmful effects. In humans, its anticholinergic properties will cause the disruption of cognitive capacities, such as memory and learning.","Ataxia Telangiectasia,[dsyn],24.11,C0004135|Narcosis,[mobd],24.11,C0234447|Delirium,[mobd],20.95,C0011206|Hallucinations,[mobd],20.95,C0018524|Photophobia,[sosy],20.95,C0085636|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Inspiration function,[orgf],17.80,C0004048|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],17.80,C0935572|Sweating,[fndg],17.80,C0038990|Urinary Retention,[fndg],17.80,C0080274|heart rate,[clna],17.80,C0018810|Speech,[orgf],16.30,C0037817|Vision,[orgf],16.30,C0042789|Abnormal behavior,[mobd],14.64,C0233514|Constipation,[sosy],14.64,C0009806|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Flushing,[sosy],14.64,C0016382|Learning,[menp],14.64,C0023185|Memory,[menp],14.64,C0025260|Paralysed,[fndg],14.64,C0522224|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Tachycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0039231|Poisoning,[inpo],13.25,C0032343|Xerostomia,[fndg],13.22,C0043352|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.09,C0039336|Ability,[orga],13.00,C0085732|Mental Suffering,[mobd],12.89,C0683278|Exanthema,[sosy],11.49,C0015230|Mydriasis,[sosy],11.49,C0026961|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],11.49,C0031354|Anticholinergic Syndrome,[dsyn],9.92,C0151500|Disease,[dsyn],9.84,C0012634|Cognition,[menp],9.70,C0009240|Gastrointestinal Diseases,[dsyn],8.34,C0017178|Pregnancy Complications,[patf],6.84,C0032962|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],5.18,C0007222|Mental disorders,[mobd],5.18,C0004936|"
"('belladonna', 'Uses')","The common name belladonna originates from its historic use by women, as bella donna is Italian for ""beautiful lady"". Drops prepared from the belladonna plant were used to dilate women's pupils, an effect considered to be attractive and seductive. Belladonna drops act as a muscarinic antagonist, blocking receptors in the muscles of the eye that constrict pupil size. Belladonna is currently rarely used cosmetically, as it carries the adverse effects of causing minor visual distortions, inability to focus on near objects, and increased heart rate. Prolonged usage was reputed to cause blindness. 
 In the United States, belladonna is marketed as a dietary supplement, typically as an atropine ingredient in over-the-counter cold medicine products. Although such cold medicine products are probably safe for oral use at typical atropine dosages (0.2 milligram), there is inadequate scientific evidence to assure their effectiveness.  By FDA guidelines for supplements, there are no regulated manufacturing standards for cold medicines containing atropine, with some belladona supplements found to contain contaminants. 
 Scientific evidence to recommend the use of A. belladonna in its natural form for any condition is insufficient, although some of its components, in particular l-atropine, which was purified from belladonna in the 1830s, have accepted medical uses. Donnatal is a prescription pharmaceutical, that combines natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic or antispasmodic action and mild sedation. Donnatal contains 0.0194 mg of atropine. According to the FDA and Donnatal labeling, it is possibly effective for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis. Donnatal is not approved by the FDA as being either safe or effective. According to the FDA, Donnatal use has significant risks: it can cause harm to a fetus if administered to a pregnant woman, can lead to heat prostration if used in hot climates, may cause diarrhea, and may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.Belladonna has been used in herbal medicine for centuries as a pain reliever, muscle relaxer, and anti-inflammatory, and to treat menstrual problems, peptic ulcer disease, histaminic reaction, and motion sickness.At least one 19th-century eclectic medicine journal explained how to prepare a belladonna tincture for direct administration. In homeopathic practices, belladonna was prescribed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann as a topical medication for inflammation and pain. In the form of Doktor Koster's Antigaspills, belladonna was a homeopathic medication for upset stomach and excessive flatulence. There is insufficient scientific evidence justifying the use of belladonna for these or any other clinical disorders.In 2010 and 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration warned consumers against the use of homeopathic teething tablets and gels containing belladonna as used for infants and children, stating that the products may be toxic, causing ""seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargy, excessive sleepiness, muscle weakness, skin flushing, constipation, difficulty urinating, or agitation"". 
 Atropa belladonna and related plants, such as Datura stramonium (commonly known as jimson weed), have occasionally been used as recreational drugs because of the vivid hallucinations and delirium they produce. These hallucinations are most commonly described as very unpleasant, and recreational use is considered extremely dangerous because of the high risk of unintentional fatal overdose. The main psychoactive ingredients are the alkaloids scopolamine, and to a lesser extent, hyoscyamine. The effects of atropine on the central nervous system include memory disruption, which may lead to severe confusion. The major effects of belladonna consumption last for three to four hours; visual hallucinations can last for three to four days, and some negative aftereffects are preserved for several days. 
 The tropane alkaloids of A. belladonna were used as poisons, and early humans made poisonous arrows from the plant. In Ancient Rome, it was used as a poison by Agrippina the Younger, wife of Emperor Claudius on the advice of Locusta, a woman who specialized in poisons, and Livia, who is rumored to have used it to kill her husband Emperor Augustus.Macbeth of Scotland, when he was still one of the lieutenants of King Duncan I of Scotland, used it during a truce to poison the troops of the invading Harold Harefoot, King of England, to the point that the English troops were unable to stand their ground and had to retreat to their ships.Medical historians also suspect that Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841, was poisoned using a combination of Atropa belladonna and laudanum.","Pupil,[bpoc],32.78,C0034121|Blindness,[fndg],20.95,C0456909|Tachycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0039231|Muscle of orbit,[bpoc],12.90,C0028863|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.08,C0018790|Cold Temperature,[npop],68.20,C0009264|Common Cold,[dsyn],39.36,C0009443|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],29.74,C0041912|Irritable Bowel Syndrome,[dsyn],80.51,C0022104|Pain,[sosy],26.26,C0030193|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.49,C2350229|Disease,[dsyn],19.78,C0012634|Hypersomnia,[dsyn],17.80,C0917799|Lethargy,[sosy],17.80,C0023380|Muscle Weakness,[sosy],17.80,C0151786|Peptic Ulcer,[dsyn],17.80,C0030920|Vision,[orgf],16.30,C0042789|Climate,[npop],16.18,C0008946|Constipation,[sosy],14.64,C0009806|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Dyspnea,[sosy],14.64,C0013404|Paresis,[dsyn],14.64,C0030552|Prescription procedure,[hlca],14.64,C0033080|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Enterocolitis,[dsyn],13.14,C0014356|Flatulence,[sosy],13.14,C0016204|Flushing,[sosy],13.14,C0016382|Stomach,[bpoc],12.89,C0038351|Menstruation Disturbances,[patf],11.49,C0025345|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Heat Exhaustion,[inpo],9.95,C0018839|Motion Sickness,[dsyn],9.77,C0026603|Inflammation,[patf],9.74,C0021368|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.66,C0026845|Fetal Tissue,[tisu],6.59,C0242291|Teething syndrome,[fndg],3.42,C0039437|Hallucinations,[mobd],39.43,C0018524|Delirium,[mobd],20.95,C0011206|Hallucinations, Visual,[sosy],20.95,C0233763|Confusion,[mobd],16.18,C0009676|Drug Overdose,[inpo],16.03,C0029944|Memory,[menp],12.96,C0025260|Drug abuse,[mobd],3.66,C0013146|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.43,C0009830|Males,[orga],9.94,C0086582|"

"('beta-carotene', 'Side effects')","Excess  -carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. The most common side effect of excessive  -carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis. Adults' fat stores are often yellow from accumulated carotenoids, including  -carotene, while infants' fat stores are white. Carotenodermia is quickly reversible upon cessation of excessive intakes.The proportion of carotenoids absorbed decreases as dietary intake increases. Within the intestinal wall (mucosa),  -carotene is partially converted into vitamin A (retinol) by an enzyme, dioxygenase. This mechanism is regulated by the individual's vitamin A status. If the body has enough vitamin A, the conversion of  -carotene decreases. Therefore,  -carotene is considered a safe source of vitamin A and high intakes will not lead to hypervitaminosis A. 
 Excess  -carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body.

Adults' fat stores are often yellow from accumulated carotenoids, including  -carotene, while infants' fat stores are white. Carotenodermia is quickly reversible upon cessation of excessive intakes. -Carotene can interact with medication used for lowering cholesterol. Taking them together can lower the effectiveness of these medications and is considered only a moderate interaction.  -Carotene should not be taken with orlistat, a weight-loss medication, as orlistat can reduce the absorption of  -carotene by as much as 30%. Bile acid sequestrants and proton-pump inhibitors can also decrease absorption of  -carotene. Consuming alcohol with  -carotene can decrease its ability to convert to retinol and could possibly result in hepatotoxicity.

Adults' fat stores are often yellow from accumulated carotenoids, including  -carotene, while infants' fat stores are white. Carotenodermia is quickly reversible upon cessation of excessive intakes.Chronic high doses of  -carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers. The effect is specific to supplementation dose as no lung damage has been detected in those who are exposed to cigarette smoke and who ingest a physiologic dose of  -carotene (6 mg), in contrast to high pharmacologic dose (30 mg). Therefore, the oncology from  -carotene is based on both cigarette smoke and high daily doses of  -carotene.Increases in lung cancer may be due to the tendency of  -carotene to oxidize, and may hasten oxidation more than other food colors such as annatto. A  -carotene breakdown product suspected of causing cancer at high dose is trans- -apo-8'-carotenal (common apocarotenal), which has been found in one study to be mutagenic and genotoxic in cell cultures which do not respond to  -carotene itself.Additionally, supplemental  -carotene may increase the risk of prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality in people who smoke cigarettes or have a history of high-level exposure to asbestos.","Mucous Membrane,[tisu],11.49,C0026724|Hypervitaminosis A,[dsyn],9.95,C0020579|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Adipose tissue,[tisu],9.90,C0001527|Intestines,[bpoc],9.81,C0021853|Epidermis,[tisu],9.73,C0014520|Epidermal cells,[cell],6.58,C3496194|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.42,C0009830|Biological Absorption,[orgf],26.23,C2347023|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Adipose tissue,[tisu],9.90,C0001527|Epidermis,[tisu],9.73,C0014520|Epidermal cells,[cell],6.58,C3496194|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.42,C0009830|Cerebral Hemorrhage,[patf],20.95,C2937358|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Adipose tissue,[tisu],9.90,C0001527|Epidermis,[tisu],9.73,C0014520|Smoker,[fndg],8.34,C0337664|Malignant neoplasm of lung,[neop],7.03,C0242379|Mutagenesis Process,[moft],6.97,C0079866|Lung,[bpoc],6.83,C0024109|Epidermal cells,[cell],6.58,C3496194|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.57,C0006826|Neoplasms,[neop],3.57,C0027651|Malignant neoplasm of prostate,[neop],3.51,C0376358|Catabolism,[orgf],3.48,C0699900|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.42,C0009830|"

Bifidobacteria improve the gut mucosal barrier and lower levels of lipopolysaccharide in the intestine.Naturally occurring Bifidobacterium spp. may discourage the growth of Gram-negative pathogens in infants.Mother's milk contains high concentrations of lactose and lower quantities of phosphate (pH buffer).

"('biotin', 'Dietary recommendations')","The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs), Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for many vitamins in 1998. At that time there was insufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for biotin. In instances such as this, the IOM sets Adequate Intakes (AIs) with the understanding that at some later date, when the physiological effects of biotin are better understood, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. Collectively EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).The biotin AIs for both males and females (except for in pregnancy and lactation) are: 5  g/day of biotin for 0-6-month-olds, 6  g/day of biotin for 7-12-month-olds, 8  g/day of biotin for 1-3-year-olds, 12  g/day of biotin for 4-8-year-olds, 20  g/day of biotin for 9-13-year-olds, 25  g/day of biotin for 14-18-year-olds, and 30  g/day of biotin for those 19-years old and older.
The biotin AIs for females who are either pregnant or lactating, respectively, are: 30  g/day of biotin for pregnant females 14-50-years old; 35  g/day of biotin for lactating females 14-50-years old.The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men over age 18, the Adequate Intake is set at 40  g/day. The AI for pregnancy is 40  g/day per day, and 45  g/day during breastfeeding. For children ages 1 17 years, the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35  g/day.For the United States food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (DV). For biotin labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was revised in 2016 to 30  g/day to bring it into agreement with the AI.

"('biotin', 'Use in biotechnology')","Biotin is widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to conjugate proteins for biochemical assays. Biotin's small size means the biological activity of the protein will most likely be unaffected. This process is called biotinylation. Because both streptavidin and avidin bind biotin with high affinity (Kd of 10 14 to 10 15 M) and specificity, biotinylated proteins of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. The sample is incubated with streptavidin/avidin beads, allowing capture of the biotinylated protein of interest. Any other proteins binding to the biotinylated molecule will also stay with the bead and all other unbound proteins can be washed away. However, due to the extremely strong streptavidin-biotin interaction, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads (typically 6 M guanidine HCl at pH 1.5), which often will denature the protein of interest. To circumvent this problem, beads conjugated to monomeric avidin can be used, which has a decreased biotin-binding affinity of  10 8 M, allowing the biotinylated protein of interest to be eluted with excess free biotin.","Bulbo-Spinal Atrophy, X-Linked,[dsyn],16.18,C1839259|Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome,[dsyn],13.03,C0026691|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|"

"('bitter melon', 'Culinary uses')","Bitter melon is generally consumed cooked in the green or early yellowing stage. The young shoots and leaves of the bitter melon may also be eaten as greens.
In Chinese cuisine, bitter melon (  , pinyin: k gu , POJ: kh  -koe) is valued for its bitter flavor, typically in stir-fries (often with pork and douchi), soups, dim sum, and herbal teas (gohyah tea). It has also been used in place of hops as the bittering ingredient in some beers in China and Okinawa.Bitter melon is commonly eaten throughout India. In North Indian cuisine, it is often served with yogurt on the side to offset the bitterness, used in curry such as sabzi or stuffed with spices and then cooked in oil.
In South Indian cuisine, it is used in the dishes thoran/thuvaran (mixed with grated coconut), mezhukkupuratti (stir-fried with spices), theeyal (cooked with roasted coconut) and pachadi (which is considered a medicinal food for diabetics). Other popular recipes include preparations with curry, deep-frying with peanuts or other ground nuts, and pachi pulusu, a soup with fried onions and other spices. In Karnataka bitter melon is known as h galak yi (        ) in Kannada; in Tamil Nadu it is known as paagarkaai or pavakai (         ) in Tamil. In these regions, a special preparation called pagarkai pitla, a kind of sour koottu, is common. Also commonly seen is kattu pagarkkai, a curry in which bitter melons are stuffed with onions, cooked lentil and grated coconut mix, then tied with thread and fried in oil. In the Konkan region of Maharashtra, salt is added to finely chopped bitter gourd, known as karle (     ) in Marathi,  and then it is squeezed, removing its bitter juice to some extent. After frying this with different spices, the less bitter and crispy preparation is served with grated coconut. Bitter melon is known as karate (Konkani:        ) in Goa; it is valued for its health benefits and used widely in Goan cuisine.
In northern India and Nepal, bitter melon, known as tite karela (          ) in Nepali, is prepared as a fresh pickle. For this, the vegetable is cut into cubes or slices, and saut ed with oil and a sprinkle of water. When it is softened and reduced, it is crushed in a mortar with a few cloves of garlic, salt and a red or green pepper. It is also eaten saut ed to golden-brown, stuffed, or as a curry on its own or with potatoes.
In Burmese cuisine, bitter melon is saute d with garlic, tomatoes, spices and dried shrimp and is served as an accompaniment to other dishes. Such a dish is available at street stalls and deli counters throughout the country.
In Sri Lanka, it is known as karavila (     ) in Sinhala and is an ingredient in many different curry dishes (e.g., karawila curry and karawila sambol) which are served mainly with rice in a main meal. Sometimes large grated coconut pieces are added, which is more common in rural areas. Karawila juice is also sometimes served there.
In Pakistan, where it is known as karela (     ) in Urdu-speaking areas, and Bangladesh, where it is known as korola (    |    ) in Bengali, bitter melon is often cooked with onions, red chili powder, turmeric powder, salt, coriander powder, and a pinch of cumin seeds.  Another dish in Pakistan calls for whole, unpeeled bitter melon to be boiled and then stuffed with cooked minced beef, served with either hot tandoori bread, naan, chappati, or with khichri (a mixture of lentils and rice).

Bitter melon, known as g y  (    ) in Okinawan, and nigauri (  ) in Japanese (although the Okinawan word g y  is also used), is a significant ingredient in Okinawan cuisine, and is increasingly used in Japanese cuisine beyond that island.
In Indonesian cuisine, bitter melon, known as pare in Javanese and Indonesian (also paria), is prepared in various dishes, such as gado-gado, and also stir-fried, cooked in coconut milk, or steamed.  In Christian areas in Eastern Indonesia it is cooked with pork and chile, the sweetness of the pork balancing against the bitterness of the vegetable.
In Vietnamese cuisine, raw bitter melon slices known as m  p   ng or kh  qua in Vietnamese, eaten with dried meat floss and bitter melon soup with shrimp, are common dishes. Bitter melons stuffed with ground pork are commonly served as a summer soup in the south. It is also used as the main ingredient of stewed bitter melon. This dish is usually cooked for the T t holiday, where its ""bitter"" name is taken as a reminder of the bitter living conditions experienced in the past.
In Thai cuisine, the Chinese variety of green bitter melon, mara (    ) in Thai, is prepared stuffed with minced pork and garlic, in a clear broth. It is also served sliced, stir-fried with garlic and fish sauce until just tender.  Varieties found in Thailand range from large fruit to small fruit.  The smallest fruit variety (mara khii nok) is generally not cultivated, but is occasionally found in the wild and is considered the most nutritious variety.
In the cuisine of the Philippines, bitter melon, known as ampalaya in Tagalog and parya in Ilokano, may be stir-fried with ground beef and oyster sauce, or with eggs and diced tomato. The dish pinakbet, popular in the Ilocos region of Luzon, consists mainly of bitter melons, eggplant, okra, string beans, tomatoes, lima beans, and other various regional vegetables all stewed together with a little bagoong-based stock.
In Trinidad and Tobago, bitter melons, known as caraille or carilley, are usually saut ed with onion, garlic and scotch bonnet pepper until almost crisp.
In Mauritius, bitter melons are known as margose or margoze.","Eating,[orgf],13.02,C0013470|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Eating,[orgf],13.02,C0013470|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.14,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Cuboid Bone,[bpoc],19.26,C0376381|Eating,[orgf],12.86,C0013470|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.72,C0332679|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],33.67,C0020498|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.02,C0020498|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.48,C2350229|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.18,C0020498|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.18,C0026131|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.15,C0020498|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.99,C0020498|Eating,[orgf],12.99,C0013470|Holidays,[acty],9.86,C0019843|Negative Surgical Margin,[fndg],9.81,C1709157|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.12,C0020498|"

"('black psyllium', 'Uses')","Preparations containing psyllium  are sold under brand names such as Metamucil (in the US and elsewhere) and Fybogel (in the UK).Psyllium is mainly used as a viscous, soluble dietary fiber, which is not absorbed by the small intestine. The purely mechanical action of psyllium mucilage is to absorb excess water while stimulating normal bowel elimination. Although its main use has been as a laxative, it is more appropriately termed a true dietary fiber and as such can help reduce the symptoms of both constipation and mild diarrhea. The laxative properties of psyllium are attributed to the fiber: it absorbs water and subsequently softens the stool. It does increase flatulence to some degree. 
 Preparations containing psyllium  are sold under brand names such as Metamucil (in the US and elsewhere) and Fybogel (in the UK).Psyllium fiber is an effective and well-tolerated part of a prudent diet for the treatment of mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia, functioning by interfering with cholesterol absorption. In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a health claim for dietary psyllium as a soluble fiber that would reduce the risk of heart disease. What was proven in clinical trials was that seven grams or more per day of soluble fiber from psyllium seed husk would sufficiently lower total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with hypercholesterolemia, accepted biomarkers for risk for coronary heart disease. None of the clinical trials were large enough or long enough to confirm that consuming psyllium had the expected disease effect. The science available at the time was summarized in a review, and has since been confirmed in a meta-analysis that incorporated more evidence. For a food or dietary supplement for the FDA-allowed health claim it must contain at least 1.7 grams of psyllium per serving, i.e., 25% of the amount designated as effective. Psyllium joined whole oats, barley and sources of beta-glucan soluble fiber as deserving the coronary heart disease risk lowering label claim. The European Food Safety Authority   responsible for reviewing health claim proposals for the European Union   has no record of having considered a psyllium health claim for lipid management. 
 Preparations containing psyllium  are sold under brand names such as Metamucil (in the US and elsewhere) and Fybogel (in the UK).In 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a Qualified Health Claim (QHC) for psyllium being a benefit for people with diabetes. Any company wishing to use this QHC must use the FDA-approved wording on the label: ""Psyllium husk may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence for this claim.""  A meta-analysis published after the FDA decision reported that psyllium provided before meals improved fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), but that the larger effect was seen in people diagnosed with and being treated for type 2 diabetes, and only a modest improvement for people classified as pre-diabetic. The European Food Safety Authority - responsible for reviewing health claim proposals for the European Union - has no record of having considered a psyllium health claim for glucose management. 
 Preparations containing psyllium  are sold under brand names such as Metamucil (in the US and elsewhere) and Fybogel (in the UK).As a thickener, it has been used in ice cream and frozen desserts. A 1.5% weight/volume ratio of psyllium mucilage exhibits binding properties that are superior to a 10% weight/volume ratio of starch mucilage.

Blueberry jam is made from blueberries, sugar, water, and fruit pectin. Blueberry sauce is a sweet sauce prepared using blueberries as a primary ingredient.
Blueberry wine is made from the flesh and skin of the berry, which is fermented and then matured; usually the lowbush variety is used.Blueberries contain anthocyanins, other polyphenols and various phytochemicals under preliminary research for their potential role in the human body. Most polyphenol studies have been conducted using the highbush cultivar of blueberries (V. corymbosum), while content of polyphenols and anthocyanins in lowbush (wild) blueberries (V. angustifolium) exceeds values found in highbush cultivars.","Freezing,[npop],16.25,C0016701|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.70,C0006660|Freezing,[npop],16.25,C0016701|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|"
"('blue-green algae', 'Biotechnology and applications')","The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was the third prokaryote and first photosynthetic organism whose genome was completely sequenced. It continues to be an important model organism. Cyanothece ATCC 51142 is an important diazotrophic model organism. The smallest genomes have been found in Prochlorococcus spp. (1.7 Mb) and the largest in Nostoc punctiforme (9 Mb). Those of Calothrix spp. are estimated at 12 15 Mb, as large as yeast.

Recent research has suggested the potential application of cyanobacteria to the generation of renewable energy by directly converting sunlight into electricity. Internal photosynthetic pathways can be coupled to chemical mediators that transfer electrons to external electrodes. In the shorter term, efforts are underway to commercialize algae-based fuels such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel.

Researchers from a company called Algenol have cultured genetically modified cyanobacteria in sea water inside a clear plastic enclosure so they first make sugar (pyruvate) from CO2 and the water via photosynthesis. Then, the bacteria secrete ethanol from the cell into the salt water. As the day progresses, and the solar radiation intensifies, ethanol concentrations build up and the ethanol itself evaporates onto the roof of the enclosure. As the sun recedes, evaporated ethanol and water condense into droplets, which run along the plastic walls and into ethanol collectors, from where it is extracted from the enclosure with the water and ethanol separated outside the enclosure. As of March 2013, Algenol was claiming to have tested its technology in Florida and to have achieved yields of 9,000 US gallons per acre per year. This could potentially meet US demands for ethanol in gasoline in 2025, assuming a B30 blend, from an area of around half the size of California's San Bernardino County, requiring less than one-tenth of the area than ethanol from other biomass, such as corn, and only very limited amounts of fresh water.Cyanobacteria may possess the ability to produce substances that could one day serve as anti-inflammatory agents and combat bacterial infections in humans.Spirulina's extracted blue color is used as a natural food coloring in gum and candy.Researchers from several space agencies argue that cyanobacteria could be used for producing goods for human consumption in future manned outposts on Mars, by transforming materials available on this planet.","Photosynthesis,[npop],12.87,C0031764|Sunlight,[npop],19.36,C0038817|Diesel Fuel,[sbst],19.35,C0012152|Term Birth,[orgf],19.25,C0233324|Psychological Transfer,[menp],14.64,C0040671|Electricity,[npop],12.91,C0013790|Photosynthesis,[npop],12.89,C0031764|Drinking Water,[sbst],93.55,C0599638|Plastics,[sbst],32.45,C0032167|Sunlight,[npop],20.95,C0038817|Gingiva,[tisu],17.80,C0017562|Solar Energy,[npop],17.80,C0037605|Seawater,[sbst],16.07,C0036499|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Hydranencephaly with Renal Aplasia-Dysplasia,[dsyn],13.14,C1856053|Fresh Water,[sbst],12.91,C0016710|Photosynthesis,[npop],12.90,C0031764|Negative Surgical Margin,[fndg],9.78,C1709157|Males,[orga],9.71,C0086582|Bacterial Infections,[dsyn],6.72,C0004623|Corn of toe,[acab],5.18,C0010046|Separated from cohabitee,[fndg],5.18,C0086972|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Mental concentration,[menp],3.47,C0086045|Cells,[cell],3.44,C0007634|"
"('blue-green algae', 'Health risks')","Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins.
Specific toxins include, anatoxin-a, anatoxin-as, aplysiatoxin, cyanopeptolin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, nodularin R (from Nodularia), neosaxitoxin, and saxitoxin. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in algal blooms, which can become harmful to other species, and pose a danger to humans and animals, if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks.Recent studies suggest that significant exposure to high levels of cyanobacteria producing toxins such as BMAA can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
People living within half a mile of cyanobacterially contaminated lakes have had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing ALS than the rest of the population; people around New Hampshire's Lake Mascoma had an up to 25 times greater risk of ALS than the expected incidence.

However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or Czochralski processes.The production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.","Fever,[sosy],26.25,C0015967|Melting,[npop],16.18,C0599882|"
"('boron', 'Applications')","Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into boric acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.
The major global industrial-scale use of boron compounds (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.Boron fibers (boron filaments) are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods. The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament.Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows production of even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450 GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17 GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.

The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.
The highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for ""Electrical"" use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant).Not all fiberglasses contain boron, but on a global scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.

Boron carbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B2O3 with carbon in an electric furnace:

2 B2O3 + 7 C   B4C + 6 COBoron carbide's structure is only approximately B4C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.
Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.

Boron nitride is a material isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.

Higher percentages are added to steels used in the nuclear industry due to boron's neutron absorption ability.
Boron can also increase the surface hardness of steels and alloys through boriding. Additionally metal borides are used for coating tools through chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion implantation or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.For example, rhenium diboride can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.
Similarly, AlMgB14 + TiB2 composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.

Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.

"('boron', 'Biological role')","Boron is an essential plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0 ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8 ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8 ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0 ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.It is thought that boron plays several essential roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that boron is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult dietary intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20 mg/day.In 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.There exist several known boron-containing natural antibiotics. The first one found was boromycin, isolated from streptomyces.Congenital endothelial dystrophy type 2, a rare form of corneal dystrophy, is linked to mutations in SLC4A11 gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2 g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4 g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity. Dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth, wound healing, and antioxidant activity, and insufficient amount of boron in diet may result in boron deficiency.
Single medical doses of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity.
Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.The boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.

Boron is necessary for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil. It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.","Soil,[sbst],53.49,C0037592|Bone Growth,[ortf],25.56,C0971859|Body Weight,[orga],22.36,C0005910|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Digestion,[orgf],13.14,C0012238|Incident Reporting,[hlca],13.11,C0178896|Protoplasm,[celc],12.89,C0175996|Cornea,[bpoc],12.89,C0010031|Serum,[bdsu],12.89,C0229671|Diet therapy,[hlca],11.49,C0012159|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Wound Healing,[orgf],11.49,C0043240|Mental concentration,[menp],10.83,C0086045|Endothelium,[tisu],9.91,C0014257|Mutation,[genf],9.90,C0026882|Urine,[bdsu],9.90,C0042036|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.88,C0162429|Necrosis,[ortf],9.88,C0027540|Surgical margins,[bpoc],9.83,C0229985|Growth,[orgf],9.77,C0018270|Cell Wall,[celc],9.77,C0007623|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Biological Transport,[celf],6.71,C0005528|Maintenance,[acty],6.71,C0024501|Urinary tract,[bpoc],6.63,C0042027|Unmarried,[fndg],22.35,C0087136|Fire - disasters,[phpr],9.73,C0016141|Magnesium Deficiency,[dsyn],16.19,C0024473|Confusion,[mobd],16.18,C0009676|Soil,[sbst],13.03,C0037592|Exanthema,[sosy],9.87,C0015230|Plant Development,[orgf],9.79,C0597252|"

"('cannabidiol ', 'Medical uses')","There has been little high-quality research into the use of cannabidiol for epilepsy. The limited available evidence primarily focuses on refractory epilepsy in children. Using medical-grade cannabidiol in combination with conventional medication has shown some promise for reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life. While cannabidiol treatment is generally well tolerated, it is also associated with some minor adverse effects.In the United States, the cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018, for treatment of epilepsy associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. 
 Preliminary research on other possible therapeutic uses for cannabidiol include several neurological disorders, but the findings have not been confirmed by sufficient high-quality clinical research to establish such uses in clinical practice.

"('cannabidiol ', 'Pharmacology')","Cannabidiol has low affinity for the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, although it can act as an antagonist of CB1/CB2 agonists despite this low affinity.  Cannabidiol may be an antagonist of GPR55, a G protein-coupled receptor and putative cannabinoid receptor that is expressed in the caudate nucleus and putamen in the brain. It also may act as an inverse agonist of GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12. CBD has been shown to act as a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. It is an allosteric modulator of the  - and  -opioid receptors as well. The pharmacological effects of CBD may involve PPAR  agonism and intracellular calcium release. 
 The oral bioavailability of CBD is approximately 6% in humans, while its bioavailability via inhalation is 11 to 45% (mean 31%). The elimination half-life of CBD is 18 32 hours. Cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver as well as in the intestines by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, and UGT1A7, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 isoforms. CBD may have a wide margin in dosing.

"('cannabidiol ', 'Society and culture')","CBD does not appear to have any psychotropic (""high"") effects such as those caused by  9-THC in marijuana, but may have anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic effects. As the legal landscape and understanding about the differences in medical cannabinoids unfolds, experts are working to distinguish ""medical marijuana"" (with varying degrees of psychotropic effects and deficits in executive function)   from ""medical CBD therapies  which would commonly present as having a reduced or non-psychoactive side-effect profile.Various strains of ""medical marijuana"" are found to have a significant variation in the ratios of CBD-to-THC, and are known to contain other non-psychotropic cannabinoids. Any psychoactive marijuana, regardless of its CBD content, is derived from the flower (or bud) of the genus Cannabis. As defined by U.S. federal law, non-psychoactive hemp (also commonly-termed industrial hemp), regardless of its CBD content, is any part of the cannabis plant, whether growing or not, containing a  -9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of no more than 0.3% on a dry-weight basis. Certain standards are required for legal growing, cultivating, and producing the hemp plant. The Colorado Industrial Hemp Program registers growers of industrial hemp and samples crops to verify that the dry-weight THC concentration does not exceed 0.3%. 
 As of October 2019, CBD extracted from marijuana remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance, and is not approved as a prescription drug, dietary supplement, or allowed for interstate commerce in the United States. CBD derived from hemp (with 0.3% THC or lower) is legal to sell as a cosmetics ingredient but cannot be sold under federal law as an ingredient in food, dietary supplements, or animal food. It is a common misconception that the legal ability to sell hemp (which may contain CBD) makes CBD legal.In September 2018, following its approval by the FDA for rare types of childhood epilepsy, Epidiolex was rescheduled (by the Drug Enforcement Administration) as a Schedule V drug to allow for its prescription use.  This allows GW Pharmaceuticals to sell Epidiolex, but it does not apply broadly and all other CBD-containing products remain Schedule I drugs.  Epidiolex still requires rescheduling in some states before it can be prescribed in those states.In 2013, a CNN program that featured Charlotte's Web cannabis brought increased attention to the use of CBD in the treatment of seizure disorders.  Since then, 16 states have passed laws to allow the use of CBD products with a physician's recommendation (instead of a prescription) for treatment of certain medical conditions. This is in addition to the 30 states that have passed comprehensive medical cannabis laws, which allow for the use of cannabis products with no restrictions on THC content. Of these 30 states, eight have legalized the use and sale of cannabis products without requirement for a physician's recommendation. As of October 2019, CBD was not a FDA-approved drug eligible for interstate commerce.Some manufacturers ship CBD products nationally, an illegal action which the FDA did not enforce in 2018, with CBD remaining the subject of an FDA investigational new drug evaluation, and is not considered legal as a dietary supplement or food ingredient as of October 2019. Federal illegality has made it difficult historically to conduct research on CBD. CBD is openly sold in head shops and health food stores in some states where such sales have not been explicitly legalized.State and local governments may also regulate CBD. For example, the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources issued a rule in June 2019 aligning state CBD regulations with FDA regulations. This means that although recreational marijuana is legal in the state, CBD cannot legally be sold in food or as a dietary supplement under state law.From 2015 to July 2019, the FDA issued 48 warning letters to 23 American manufacturers of CBD products for false advertising and illegal interstate marketing of CBD as an unapproved drug to treat diseases, such as cancer, osteoarthritis, symptoms of opioid withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, and pet disorders. The FDA said that the letters were issued to enforce action against companies that were deceiving consumers by marketing illegal products for which there was insufficient evidence of safety and efficacy to treat diseases. In July 2019, the FDA stated: ""Selling unapproved products with unsubstantiated therapeutic claims   such as claims that CBD products can treat serious diseases and conditions   can put patients and consumers at risk by leading them to put off important medical care. Additionally, there are many unanswered questions about the science, safety, effectiveness and quality of unapproved products containing CBD.""In October 2019, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced a joint warning to a Florida supplements company marketing CBD products as unapproved drugs to treat childhood autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson s disease, Alzheimer s disease, acne, and infant teething and ear aches. The warning also applied to hemp CBD capsules and oil that were being marketed illegally while not adhering to the federal definition of a dietary supplement.

"('cascara sagrada', 'Traditional medicine as a laxative')","Historically, cascara was used in traditional medicine as a laxative, and in the late 20th century, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use for this purpose. In the early 21st century, however, the FDA withdrew its approval, citing the absence of evidence for efficacy and safety. Cascara remains available in the United States as an unregulated dietary supplement.The dried, aged bark of R. purshiana has been used continually for many years by both Pacific northwest native peoples and immigrant Euro-Americans as a laxative natural medicine, as one of several anthraquinone-containing herbal medicines including the leaf and fruits of senna, the latex of Aloe vera, and the root of the rhubarb plant. Commercially it is called ""cascara sagrada"" ('sacred bark' in Spanish), while traditionally it is known as ""chittem bark"" or ""chitticum bark"".Spanish conquerors exploring the Pacific Northwest in the 1600s came across many Native peoples using the bark of R. purshiana as a laxative. They gave it the name ""sacred bark"" (c scara sagrada) in honor of its effectiveness. By 1877 the U.S. pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis was producing cascara preparations, and soon afterwards cascara products were being exported overseas to European markets. The explosion of the cascara industry caused great damage to native cascara populations during the 1900s, as a result of overharvesting.In 1999, cascara made up more than 20% of the national laxative market in the U.S., with an estimated value of $400 million. The bark itself was worth approximately $100 million. Cascara was found in more drug preparations than any other natural product in North America, and is believed to be the most widely used cathartic in the world. 
 Historically, cascara was used in traditional medicine as a laxative, and in the late 20th century, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its use for this purpose. In the early 21st century, however, the FDA withdrew its approval, citing the absence of evidence for efficacy and safety. Cascara remains available in the United States as an unregulated dietary supplement.Numerous quinoid substances are found in the bark of cascara. The chemicals primarily responsible for the laxative action are the hydroxyanthracene glycosides, which include cascarosides A, B, C, and D. Cascara contains approximately 8% anthranoids by mass, of which about two-thirds are cascarosides. The hydroxyanthracene glycosides act as a stimulant laxative by exciting peristalsis in the colon. They trigger peristalsis by inhibiting the absorption of water and electrolytes in the large intestine, which increases the volume of the bowel's contents, leading to increased pressure.The hydroxyanthracene glycosides are not readily absorbed in the small intestine but are hydrolyzed by intestinal flora to a form that is partly absorbed in the colon. Hydrolysis of the cascarosides results in the formation of aloins such as barbaloin and chrysaloin. Some of the chemical constituents present in the bark may be excreted by the kidney following medicinal use, resulting in a harmless change in the color of the urine.Studies have shown that the extract from cascara bark also contains a substance called emodin, which may contribute to the laxative effect, due to its excitation of smooth muscle cells in the large intestine.

In the early 21st century, however, the FDA withdrew its approval, citing the absence of evidence for efficacy and safety. Cascara remains available in the United States as an unregulated dietary supplement.The bark is collected in the spring or early summer, when it easily peels from the tree. Once stripped from the tree, the bark must be aged for at least 1 year before use, because fresh cut, dried bark causes vomiting and violent diarrhea. This drying is generally done in the shade to preserve its characteristic yellow color. This process can be quickened by simply baking the bark at a low temperature for several hours. In her book, Major Medicinal Plants, Dr. Julia Morton suggests using a dosage of 10 30 grains, dissolved in water, or 0.6 2 cc for fluid extract. James A. Duke suggests an effective dosage of approximately 1 to 3 grams (0.035 to 0.106 oz) dried bark, or 1 2.5 grams powdered bark.

Cascara remains available in the United States as an unregulated dietary supplement.Laxative should only be used on a short-term basis (no longer than 7 days), and should not be used by pregnant women (because cathartics such as cascara can induce labor), by lactating women (because the active compounds can be transferred to the infant), or by people with intestinal obstructions or injuries. Laxatives should also not be used by people with Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, hemorrhoids, appendicitis, or kidney problems.

Cascara remains available in the United States as an unregulated dietary supplement.Cascara sagrada was used by Native Americans for centuries, and was accepted into medical practice in the United States in 1877, and by 1890 had replaced the berries of the European buckthorn (R. cathartica) as a commonly used laxative. It was the principal ingredient in many commercial, over-the-counter laxatives in North American pharmacies until 9 May 2002, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloe and cascara sagrada as laxative ingredients in over-the-counter drug products. Use of cascara sagrada has been associated with abdominal pain and diarrhea; it is also potentially carcinogenic. Another study in 1999 states it is not carcinogenic.In July 2003, the FDA responded to a citizen's petition filed against the May 2002 final ruling banning the use of cascara sagrada in OTC laxatives by the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) and International Aloe Science Council (IASC) (June 2002, CP25) and subsequent data submissions that occurred in October 2002 (SUP14) and December 2002 (SUP15)).  In this letter the FDA stated that the American Herbal Products Association Botanical Safety Handbook (1997), the one cited to the FDA in CP25, contained only general information similar to information they already had in 1975. Upon further evaluation of all submitted information, the FDA found inadequate support for the petition that cascara sagrada should be generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use as a laxative.In September 2003, the FDA also responded to a petition (CP27) that was filed in August 2002 in which the FDA stated that ""the agency does not find that the benefits of using cascara sagrada laxative ingredients outweigh the risks"" and that the data contained in petition CP27  ""do not rule out the possibility that cascara sagrada preparations are genotoxic and/or carcinogenic"".","Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],118.17,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],68.46,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],68.46,C0022655|Drug Compounding,[hlca],9.90,C0013164|Blast Injuries,[inpo],9.86,C0005700|Explosion,[phpr],9.86,C0015329|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],45.13,C0007776|Colon structure (body structure),[bpoc],32.87,C0009368|Large Intestine,[bpoc],26.33,C0021851|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],26.10,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],26.10,C0022655|Peristalsis,[ortf],26.08,C0031133|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Precipitating Factors,[clna],17.80,C0032930|Intestines, Small,[bpoc],13.07,C0021852|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.03,C2347023|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],12.88,C1096155|Kidney,[bpoc],9.88,C0022646|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],9.88,C0033095|Urine,[bdsu],9.86,C0042036|Myocytes, Smooth Muscle,[cell],9.77,C1135918|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],9.71,C0018790|Hydrolysis,[npop],6.72,C0020291|Intestinal Contents,[bdsu],6.59,C0226893|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],145.98,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],84.82,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],84.82,C0022655|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.51,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.38,C0009264|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.14,C0011991|Natural Springs,[npop],12.96,C3179043|Violence,[mobd],12.91,C0042693|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Body Fluids,[bdsu],6.58,C0005889|Irritable Bowel Syndrome,[dsyn],20.95,C0022104|Term Birth,[orgf],19.32,C0233324|Appendicitis,[dsyn],17.80,C0003615|Colitis,[dsyn],17.80,C0009319|Crohn Disease,[dsyn],17.80,C0010346|Hemorrhoids,[dsyn],17.80,C0019112|Labor (Childbirth),[orgf],17.80,C0022864|Intestinal Obstruction,[dsyn],14.64,C0021843|Psychological Transfer,[menp],13.00,C0040671|Kidney,[bpoc],9.81,C0022646|Traumatic injury,[inpo],5.18,C3263723|Carcinogenesis,[neop],39.90,C0596263|Mental association,[menp],25.95,C0004083|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],16.26,C0000737|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|"

A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. 
 Pharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose.

"('clove', 'Uses')","Cloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, and the Near and Middle East countries, lending flavor to meats, curries, and marinades, as well as fruit such as apples, pears or rhubarb. Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages, often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice blends such as pumpkin pie spice and speculoos spices.
In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as clavos de olor, and often accompany cumin and cinnamon. They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes as carapulcra and arroz con leche.
A major component of clove taste is imparted by the chemical eugenol, and the quantity of the spice required is typically small. It pairs well with cinnamon, allspice, vanilla, red wine and basil, as well as onion, citrus peel, star anise, or peppercorns.The spice is used in a type of cigarette called kretek in Indonesia. Clove cigarettes have been smoked throughout Europe, Asia and the United States. Since 2009, clove cigarettes have been classified as cigars in the US.Because of the bioactive chemicals of clove, the spice may be used as an ant repellent.Cloves can be used to make a fragrance pomander when combined with an orange. When given as a gift in Victorian England, such a pomander indicated warmth of feeling.

Studies to determine its effectiveness for fever reduction, as a mosquito repellent, and to prevent premature ejaculation have been inconclusive. It remains unproven whether blood sugar levels are reduced by cloves or clove oil. Use of clove for any medicinal purpose has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and its use may cause adverse effects if taken orally by people with liver disease, blood clotting and immune system disorders, or food allergies. 
 Cloves are used in the cuisine of Asian, African, and the Near and Middle East countries, lending flavor to meats, curries, and marinades, as well as fruit such as apples, pears or rhubarb. Cloves may be used to give aromatic and flavor qualities to hot beverages, often combined with other ingredients such as lemon and sugar. They are a common element in spice blends such as pumpkin pie spice and speculoos spices.
In Mexican cuisine, cloves are best known as clavos de olor, and often accompany cumin and cinnamon. They are also used in Peruvian cuisine, in a wide variety of dishes as carapulcra and arroz con leche.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a tablespoon (13.6 grams or 14.8 mL) of cod liver oil contains 4,080  g of retinol (vitamin A) and 34  g (1360 IU) of vitamin D. The Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin A is 900  g per day for adult men and 700  g per day for women, while that for vitamin D is 15  g per day. The Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) are 3000  g/day and 100  g/day, respectively. People consuming cod liver oil as a source of omega-3 fatty acids should pay attention to how much vitamin A and vitamin D this adds to their diet.Cod liver oil is approximately 20% omega-3 fatty acids. For this reason cod liver oil may be beneficial in secondary prophylaxis after a heart attack.

"('creatine', 'Supplement health effects')","Creatine use can increase maximum power and performance in high-intensity anaerobic repetitive work (periods of work and rest) by 5 to 15%.  Creatine has no significant effect on aerobic endurance, though it will increase power during short sessions of high-intensity aerobic exercise.A survey of 21,000 college athletes showed that 14% of athletes take creatine supplements to improve performance. Non-athletes report taking creatine supplements to improve appearance.Creatine is reported to increase cognitive performance, especially in individuals with inadequate intakes in their diet and is claimed by some sources  to be a nootropic supplement.Creatine-monohydrate is suitable for vegetarians and vegans, as the raw materials used for the production of the supplement have no animal origin. 
 According to a clinical study focusing on people with various muscular dystrophies, using a pure form of creatine monohydrate can be beneficial in rehabilitation after injuries and immobilization. 
 A clinical study has shown that the intake of pure, high-quality creatine alone, or in combination with exercise, may reduce and delay age-related muscle atrophy, by improving fat-free body mass, muscle strength and endurance, while simultaneously improving bone density. 
 Side effects include:
Weight gain due to extra water retention to the muscle
Potential muscle cramps / strains / pulls
Upset stomach
Diarrhea
Dizziness
High blood pressure due to extra water consumptionUse of creatine by healthy adults in normal dosages does not harm kidneys; its effects on the kidney in elderly people and adolescents were not well understood as of 2012. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend that individuals younger than 18 years old not use creatine.People with kidney disease, high blood pressure, or liver disease should not take creatine as a dietary supplement.One well-documented effect of creatine supplementation is weight gain within the first week of the supplement schedule, likely attributable to greater water retention due to the increased muscle creatine concentrations.A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea. 
 Creatine taken with medications that can harm the kidney can increase the risk of kidney damage:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)   some examples are ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve)
Diuretics (water pills)   an example is furosemide (Lasix)
Cimetidine (Tagamet)
ProbenicidA National Institutes of Health study suggests that caffeine interacts with creatine to increase the rate of progression of Parkinson's Disease. 
 A 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50% of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant. The most prevalent of these contaminants was creatinine, a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body. Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in 44% of the samples. About 15% of the samples had detectable levels of dihydro-1,3,5-triazine or a high dicyandiamide concentration. Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern, with only minor levels of mercury being detectable. Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities. 
 When creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures (above 148  C), the resulting reaction produces carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs). Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan-frying meat. Creatine content (as a percentage of crude protein) can be used as an indicator of meat quality.","Vegan diet,[fndg],20.95,C0344353|Intention - mental process,[menp],19.44,C0162425|Work Performance,[fndg],9.88,C1286385|Cognition,[menp],9.76,C0009240|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Muscular Dystrophy,[dsyn],16.37,C0026850|Visual Accommodation,[ortf],6.70,C0000936|Traumatic injury,[inpo],5.18,C3263723|Muscular Atrophy,[patf],16.27,C0026846|Muscle Strength,[ortf],14.64,C0517349|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.07,C1096155|Bone Density,[clna],11.49,C0005938|Fat Body,[bpoc],6.82,C0015665|Fat pad,[tisu],3.67,C0935625|Weight Gain,[fndg],22.50,C0043094|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.35,C0599638|Retention (Psychology),[menp],16.04,C0035280|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],8.34,C0026845|Muscle Cramp,[sosy],16.08,C0026821|Muscle strain,[inpo],7.15,C0080194|Stomach,[bpoc],13.14,C0038351|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Drinking Water,[sbst],44.96,C0599638|Weight Gain,[fndg],22.48,C0043094|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],20.20,C0020538|Kidney,[bpoc],19.92,C0022646|Muscle Cramp,[sosy],16.24,C0026821|Retention (Psychology),[menp],16.04,C0035280|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Comprehension,[menp],13.01,C0162340|Kidney Diseases,[dsyn],12.94,C0022658|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Liver diseases,[dsyn],8.34,C0023895|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.62,C0026845|Mental concentration,[menp],3.61,C0086045|Kidney,[bpoc],19.92,C0022646|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.43,C0599638|Disease Progression,[patf],12.89,C0242656|Mental concentration,[menp],7.08,C0086045|Catabolism,[orgf],3.43,C0699900|Fever,[sosy],12.92,C0015967|Carcinogenesis,[neop],12.89,C0596263|"
"('creatine', 'Pharmacokinetics')","Endogenous serum or plasma creatine concentrations in healthy adults are normally in a range of 2 12 mg/L. A single 5 g (5000 mg) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120 mg/L at 1 2 hours post-ingestion. Creatine has a fairly short elimination half-life, averaging just less than 3 hours, so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3 6 hours throughout the day.
After the ""loading dose"" period (1 2 weeks, 12 24 g a day), it is no longer necessary to maintain a consistently high serum level of creatine. As with most supplements, each person has their own genetic ""preset"" amount of creatine they can hold. The rest is eliminated as waste. A typical post-loading dose is 2 5 g daily.Creatine supplementation appears to increase the number of myonuclei that satellite cells will 'donate' to damaged muscle fibers, which increases the potential for growth of those fibers.

"('deer velvet', 'Uses')","Velvet antler has been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that classifies many similar substances from a variety of species under the simplified Chinese name   ; (pinyin Lu Rong) and the commercial name Cervi Cornu Pantorichum. The two common species used within the TCM system are sika deer and red deer which are thought to be useful for treating yang deficiency syndromes.In Asia, velvet antler is dried and sold as slices, or as a powder which may be boiled in water, usually with other herbs and ingredients, and consumed as a medicinal soup. In the traditional commercial trade of Korea and China, whole stick antler velvet is divided into three sections based upon their supposed properties. Although there is an absence of uniform standardization, these sections are known as the wax piece (uppers or tips), the blood piece (middles), and the bone piece (bottoms): the wax piece may be marketed as a growth tonic for children, the blood piece supposedly for joint and bone health, and the bone piece  supposedly for calcium deficiency and geriatric needs.  Early commercial activity in Russia between the 1930s and 1980s led to the production of an alcohol extract from deer antler velvet marketed under the Russian drug trade name Pantocrin (also pantocrine or pantokrin).In the West, velvet antler is dried, powdered, and consumed in encapsulated form or via aqueous alcohol extract as a dietary supplement, for which it is monitored for potential manufacturing and advertising violations by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission.

"('dong quai', 'Pharmacology')","Angelica is a low-temperature and long-sunshine crop, suitable for cold and cool climate, and can be cultivated at an altitude of 1500-3000m. The rate of lichen extraction is high in the low sea area. The seedling stage is shade-loving and the transmittance is 10%. The growth of seedlings need to avoid the hot sun direct sun, the plant can withstand strong light. The growth of angelica should be cultivated in sandy loam with deep soil layer, loose soil, good drainage, and rich humus, not in low-lying water or easily hardened clay and barren sandy soil. 
 The dried root of A. sinensis is commonly known as Chinese angelica (Chinese:   ; pinyin: d nggu ; Pe h- e-j : tong-kui)  and is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine in the belief it benefits women's health, cardiovascular conditions, osteoarthrosis, inflammation, headache, infections, mild anemia, fatigue and high blood pressure. The dong quai (  ) means that a husband shall return to his wife, which is implicitly said to help women's sexual health.
Overall, the U.S. National Library of Medicine states that more evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of dong quai for most uses. 
 There is evidence that A. sinensis may affect the muscles of the uterus. Women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant should not use A. sinensis,  because it may induce a miscarriage. Taking A. sinensis can cause skin to become extra sensitive to the sun, leading to a greater risk for skin cancer.

Large and prolonged doses of the plant is not advised as it contains compounds that are considered carcinogenic. 
 A. sinensis may increase the anticoagulant effects of the drug warfarin (as it contains coumarins) and consequently increase the risk of bleeding.Due to the antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects of A. sinensis, it should be taken with caution with herbs or supplements (such as ginkgo, garlic, and ginger) that may slow blood clotting to reduce the possible risk of bleeding and bruising.","Cold Temperature,[npop],45.34,C0009264|Soil,[sbst],39.75,C0037592|Sunlight,[npop],38.68,C0038817|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.48,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.39,C2350229|Growth,[orgf],19.87,C0018270|Climate,[npop],16.30,C0008946|Light,[npop],16.30,C0023693|Humus,[sbst],13.14,C1258025|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.91,C0009443|Love,[menp],11.49,C0024028|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.76,C0041912|Sclerosis,[patf],9.74,C0036429|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.74,C0010352|Telling untruths,[inbe],3.56,C0600261|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.17,C0040452|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],14.64,C0029408|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0020538|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Sexual Health,[orga],10.06,C2362326|Anemia,[dsyn],9.99,C0002871|Infection,[patf],8.34,C3714514|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],4.12,C0007222|Gravidity,[fndg],35.81,C0600457|Miscarriage,[dsyn],20.95,C4552766|Spontaneous abortion,[patf],20.95,C0000786|Sunlight,[npop],19.20,C0038817|myometrium,[bpoc],16.18,C0027088|Carcinogenesis,[neop],13.28,C0596263|Gynecomastia,[dsyn],12.90,C0018418|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.71,C0020517|Malignant neoplasm of skin,[neop],5.18,C0007114|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Hemorrhage,[patf],19.60,C0019080|Blood coagulation,[ortf],13.22,C0005778|Contusions,[inpo],11.49,C0009938|"
"('eucalyptus', 'Cultivation and uses')","Eucalypts were introduced from Australia to the rest of the world following the Cook expedition in 1770. Collected by Sir Joseph Banks, botanist on the expedition, they were subsequently introduced to many parts of the world, notably California, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and South America. Approximately 250 species are under cultivation in California. In Portugal and also Spain, eucalypts have been planted in plantations for the production of pulpwood. Eucalyptus are the basis for several industries, such as sawmilling, pulp, charcoal and others. Several species have become invasive and are causing major problems for local ecosystems, mainly due to the absence of wildlife corridors and rotations management.
Eucalypts have many uses which have made them economically important trees, and they have become a cash crop in poor areas such as Timbuktu, Mali and the Peruvian Andes, despite concerns that the trees are invasive in some environments like those of South Africa. Best-known are perhaps the varieties karri and yellow box. Due to their fast growth, the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood. They can be chopped off at the root and grow back again. They provide many desirable characteristics for use as ornament, timber, firewood and pulpwood. Eucaplytus wood is also used in a number of industries, from fence posts (where the oil-rich wood's high resistance to decay is valued) and charcoal to cellulose extraction for biofuels. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks and to reduce erosion.
Some eucalyptus species have attracted attention from horticulturists, global development researchers, and environmentalists because of desirable traits such as being fast-growing sources of wood, producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide, or an ability to be used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria. Eucalyptus oil finds many uses like in fuels, fragrances, insect repellance and antimicrobial activity. Eucalyptus trees show allelopathic effects; they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby. Outside their natural ranges, eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations and criticised for being ""water-guzzling"" aliens, leading to controversy over their total impact.Eucalypts draw a tremendous amount of water from the soil through the process of transpiration. They have been planted (or re-planted) in some places to lower the water table and reduce soil salination. Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in Algeria, Lebanon, Sicily, elsewhere in Europe, in Caucasus (Western Georgia), and California. Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae, but can also destroy ecologically productive areas. This drainage is not limited to the soil surface, because the eucalyptus roots are up to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in length and can, depending on the location, even reach the phreatic zone.Eucalyptus is the most common short fibre source for pulpwood to make pulp. The types most often used in papermaking are Eucalyptus globulus (in temperate areas) and the Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis hybrid (in the tropics). The fibre length of Eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low coarseness compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood. The fibres are slender, yet relatively thick walled. This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers. The low coarseness is important for high quality coated papers.  Eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low coarseness contributes to softness.

It has insect repellent properties, and is an active ingredient in some commercial mosquito repellents. Eucalyptus globulus is the principal source of eucalyptus oil worldwide.

Colours to be achieved range from yellow and orange through green, tan, chocolate and deep rust red. The material remaining after processing can be safely used as mulch or fertiliser.

A Maia detector for x-ray elemental imaging at the Australian Synchrotron clearly showed deposits of gold and other metals in the structure of eucalyptus leaves from the Kalgoorlie region of Western Australia that would have been untraceable using other methods. The microscopic leaf-bound ""nuggets"", about 8 micrometres wide on average, are not worth collecting themselves, but may provide an environmentally benign way of locating subsurface mineral deposits.","Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Fibrosis,[patf],30.00,C0016059|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Temperance,[inbe],6.60,C0039475|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Body tissue,[tisu],3.43,C0040300|Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Coughing,[sosy],13.14,C0010200|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Wood material,[sbst],26.13,C0043217|Environmental Wind,[npop],24.11,C0043187|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Flatulence,[sosy],14.64,C0016204|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Lanugo,[bpoc],6.72,C0423866|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Drinking Water,[sbst],68.18,C0599638|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Wool,[sbst],11.49,C0043220|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Expeditions,[acty],19.72,C0015315|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],17.80,C0011399|Ecosystem,[npop],12.89,C0162358|Disease Management,[hlca],9.99,C0376636|Wood material,[sbst],40.25,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],32.42,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],20.09,C0018270|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],53.61,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.65,C0006660|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Malaria,[dsyn],19.71,C0024530|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.15,C0014518|Roentgen Rays,[npop],16.07,C0043309|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.05,C0040452|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Eye,[bpoc],12.89,C0015392|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|"
"('folic acid', 'Health effects')","Folate is especially important during periods of frequent cell division and growth, such as infancy and pregnancy. Folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting hematopoietic cells and neoplasms the most because of their greater frequency of cell division. RNA transcription and subsequent protein synthesis are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis, where a new genomic copy must be created).Folate deficiency can be caused by unhealthy diets that do not include enough vegetables and other folate-rich foods; diseases in which folates are not well absorbed in the digestive system (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease); some genetic disorders that affect levels of folate; and certain medicines (such as phenytoin, sulfasalazine, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Folate deficiency is accelerated by alcohol consumption, possibly by interference with folate transport.Folate deficiency may lead to glossitis, diarrhea, depression, confusion, anemia, and fetal neural tube and brain defects. Other symptoms include fatigue, gray hair, mouth sores, poor growth, and swollen tongue. Folate deficiency is diagnosed by analyzing a complete blood count (CBC) and plasma vitamin B12 and folate levels. A serum folate of 3  g/L or lower indicates deficiency. Serum folate level reflects folate status, but erythrocyte folate level better reflects tissue stores after intake. An erythrocyte folate level of 140  g/L or lower indicates inadequate folate status. Serum folate reacts more rapidly to folate intake than erythrocyte folate.Since folate deficiency limits cell division, erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) is hindered. This leads to megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large, immature red blood cells. This pathology results from persistently thwarted attempts at normal DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell division, and produces abnormally large red cells called megaloblasts (and hypersegmented neutrophils) with abundant cytoplasm capable of RNA and protein synthesis, but with clumping and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Some of these large cells, although immature (reticulocytes), are released early from the marrow in an attempt to compensate for the anemia. Both adults and children need folate to make normal red and white blood cells and prevent anemia, which causes fatigue, weakness, and inability to concentrate.Increased homocysteine levels suggest tissue folate deficiency, but homocysteine is also affected by vitamin B12 and vitamin B6, renal function, and genetics. One way to differentiate between folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency is by testing for methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels. Normal MMA levels indicate folate deficiency and elevated MMA levels indicate vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate deficiency is treated with supplemental oral folic acid of 400 to 1000  g per day. This treatment is very successful in replenishing tissues, even if deficiency was caused by malabsorption. People with megaloblastic anemia need to be tested for vitamin B12 deficiency before treatment with folic acid, because if the person has vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid supplementation can remove the anemia, but can also worsen neurologic problems. Cobalamin deficiency may lead to folate deficiency, which, in turn, increases homocysteine levels and may result in the development of cardiovascular disease or birth defects.

RNA transcription and subsequent protein synthesis are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis, where a new genomic copy must be created).Deficiency of folate in pregnant women has been implicated in neural tube defects (NTDs), with an estimate of 300,000 cases worldwide prior to the implementation in many countries of mandatory food fortification. NTDs occur early in pregnancy (first month), therefore women must have abundant folate upon conception and for this reason there is a recommendation that any woman planning to become pregnant consume a folate-containing dietary supplement before and during pregnancy. Compliance with this recommendation is not complete, and many women become pregnant without this being a planned pregnancy, or may not realize that they are pregnant until well into the first trimester, which is the critical period for reducing risk of NTDs. Countries have implemented either mandatory or voluntary food fortification of wheat flour and other grains, or else have no such program and depend on public health and healthcare practitioner advice to women of childbearing age. A meta-analysis of global birth prevalence of spina bifida showed that when mandatory fortification was compared to countries with voluntary fortification or no fortification program, there was a 30% reduction in live births with spina bifida. Some countries reported a greater than 50% reduction. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends folic acid as the supplement or fortification ingredient, as forms of folate other than folic acid have not been studied.A meta-analysis of folate supplementation during pregnancy reported a 28% lower relative risk of newborn congenital heart defects.  Prenatal supplementation with folic acid did not appear to reduce the risk of preterm births. One systematic review indicated no effect of folic acid on mortality, growth, body composition, respiratory, or cognitive outcomes of children from birth to 9 years old. There was no relation between maternal folic acid supplementation and an increased risk for childhood asthma.

Two older meta-analyses, which would not have incorporated results from newer clinical trials, reported no changes to the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Two other meta-analyses reported a similar decrease in relative risk. Two of these three were limited to people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease. The beneficial result may be associated with lowering circulating homocysteine concentration, as stratified analysis showed that risk was reduced more when there was a larger decrease in homocysteine. The effect was also larger for the studies that were conducted in countries that did not have mandatory grain folic acid fortification. The beneficial effect was larger in the subset of trials that used a lower folic acid supplement compared to higher.

Subsequent meta-analyses of the effects of low versus high dietary folate, elevated serum folate, and supplemental folate in the form of folic acid have reported at times conflicting results. Comparing low to high dietary folate showed a modest but statistically significant reduced risk of colon cancer. For prostate cancer risk, comparing low to high dietary folate showed no effect, but the same two studies reported a significant increased risk for prostate cancer correlating to elevated serum folate. Two reviews of trials that involved folic acid dietary supplements reported, respectively, a statistically significant 24% increase in prostate cancer risk and a not significant 17% increase in prostate cancer risk. Supplementation with folic acid at 1,000 to 2,500  g/day - the amounts used in many of the supplement trials -  would result in higher concentrations of serum folate than what is achieved from diets high in food-derived folate. The second study reported no significant increase or decrease in total cancer incidence, colorectal cancer, other gastrointestinal cancer, genitourinary cancer, lung cancer or hematological malignancies in people who were consuming folic acid supplements. A third supplementation meta-analysis limited to reporting only on colorectal cancer incidence showed that folic acid treatment was not associated with colorectal cancer risk.Folate is important for cells and tissues that divide rapidly. Cancer cells divide rapidly, and drugs that interfere with folate metabolism are used to treat cancer. The antifolate drug methotrexate is often used to treat cancer because it inhibits the production of the active form of THF from the inactive dihydrofolate (DHF). However, methotrexate can be toxic, producing side effects such as inflammation in the digestive tract that make eating normally more difficult. Bone marrow depression (inducing leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) and acute kidney and liver failure have been reported.
Folinic acid, under the drug name leucovorin, a form of folate (formyl-THF), can help ""rescue"" or reverse the toxic effects of methotrexate. Folic acid supplements have little established role in cancer chemotherapy. The supplement of folinic acid in people undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given is depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) quickly, so does not negate the effects of methotrexate.

RNA transcription and subsequent protein synthesis are less affected by folate deficiency, as the mRNA can be recycled and used again (as opposed to DNA synthesis, where a new genomic copy must be created).Conversion of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and vitamin B12. Elevated plasma homocysteine and low folate are associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Supplementing the diet with folic acid and vitamin B12 lowers plasma homocysteine. However, several reviews reported that supplementation with folic acid alone or in combination with other B vitamins did not prevent development of cognitive impairment nor slow cognitive decline.The relative risk of autism spectrum disorders was reduced by 23% when the maternal diet was supplemented during pregnancy. Subset analysis confirmed this among Asian, European and American populations.Some evidence links a shortage of folate with clinical depression. Limited evidence from randomized controlled trials showed using folic acid in addition to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have benefits. Research found a link between depression and low levels of folate. The exact mechanisms involved in the development of schizophrenia and depression are not entirely clear, but the bioactive folate, methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), a direct target of methyl donors such as S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe), recycles the inactive dihydrobiopterin (BH2) into tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the necessary cofactor in various steps of monoamine synthesis, including that of dopamine. BH4 serves a regulatory role in monoamine neurotransmission and is required to mediate the actions of most antidepressants. 5-MTHF also plays both direct & indirect roles in DNA methylation, NO2 synthesis, and one-carbon metabolism.

A deficiency of one may be ""masked"" by excess of another, so when taken as dietary supplements, the three need to be in balance.

folic acid supplementation policies for children in malaria-prone areas, such as India.","Folic Acid Deficiency,[dsyn],459.09,C0016412|Vitamin B 12 Deficiency,[dsyn],120.53,C0042847|Cell

"('folic acid', 'Dietary recommendations')","Because of the difference in bioavailability between supplemented folic acid and the different forms of folate found in food, the dietary folate equivalent (DFE) system was established. One DFE is defined as 1  g of dietary folate. One  g of folic acid supplement counts as 1.7  g DFE. The reason for the difference is that when folic acid is added to food or taken as a dietary supplement with food it is at least 85% absorbed, whereas only about 50% of folate naturally present in food is absorbed.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine defines Estimated Average Requirements (EARs), Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), Adequate Intakes (AIs) and Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) at Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men over age 18 the PRI is set at 330  g/day. PRI for pregnancy is 600  g/day, for lactation 500  g/day. For children ages 1 17 years the PRIs increase with age from 120 to 270  g/day. These values differ somewhat from the U.S. RDAs.  The United Kingdom's Dietary Reference Value for folate, set by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy in 1991, is 200  g/day for adults.The risk of toxicity from folic acid is low, because folate is a water-soluble vitamin and is regularly removed from the body through urine. One potential issue associated with high doses of folic acid is that it has a masking effect on the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency, and may even precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in vitamin B12-deficient individuals. This evidence justified development of a UL for folate. In general, ULs are set for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. The adult UL of 1,000  g for folate (and lower for children) refers specifically to folic acid used as a supplement, as no health risks have been associated with high intake of folate from food sources. The EFSA reviewed the safety question and agreed with United States that the UL be set at 1,000  g. The Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition set the adult UL at 1,300 or 1,400  g depending on age.Reviews of clinical trials that called for long-term consumption of folic acid in amounts exceeding the UL have raised concerns. One theory is that consumption of large amounts of folic acid leads to detectable amounts of unmetabolized folic acid circulating in blood because the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase that converts folic acid to the biologically active forms is rate limiting. Evidence of a negative health effect of folic acid in blood is not consistent, and folic acid has no known cofactor function that would increase the likelihood of a causal role for free FA in disease development. However, low vitamin B12 status in combination with high folic acid intake, in addition to the previously mentioned neuropathy risk, appeared to increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Long-term use of folic acid dietary supplements in excess of 1,000  g/day has been linked to an increase in prostate cancer risk.","Set (Psychology),[menp],84.79,C0036849|Vitamin B 12 Deficiency,[dsyn],45.38,C0042847|Term Birth,[orgf],38.72,C0233324|In Blood,[bdsu],35.81,C0005768|Anemia, Pernicious,[dsyn],25.51,C0002892|Blood,[bdsu],23.12,C0005767|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.56,C0599638|Breast Feeding,[orgf],19.24,C0006147|Aortic Valve Insufficiency,[dsyn],14.64,C0003504|Nutritional status,[fndg],14.64,C0392209|Lactation,[ortf],12.93,C0022925|Impaired cognition,[mobd],12.92,C0338656|Pregnancy,[orgf],12.89,C0032961|Urine,[bdsu],11.49,C0042036|Ear structure,[bpoc],9.74,C0013443|Developmental Disabilities,[mobd],9.73,C0008073|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.13,C0009830|Malignant neoplasm of prostate,[neop],3.75,C0376358|"

"('gelatin', 'Research')","Ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen may affect the skin by increasing the density of collagen fibrils and fibroblasts, thereby stimulating collagen production. It has been suggested, based on mouse and in vitro studies, that hydrolyzed collagen peptides have chemotactic properties on fibroblasts or an influence on growth of fibroblasts. 
 Some clinical studies report that the oral ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen decreases joint pain, those with the most severe symptoms showing the most benefit. Beneficial action is likely due to hydrolyzed collagen accumulation in the cartilage and stimulated production of collagen by the chondrocytes, the cells of cartilage. Several studies have shown that a daily intake of hydrolyzed collagen increases bone mass density in rats. It seems that hydrolyzed collagen peptides stimulated differentiation and osteoblasts activity   the cells that build bone   over that of osteoclasts (cells that destroy bone).
However, other clinical trials have yielded mixed results. In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies concluded that ""a cause and effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of collagen hydrolysate and maintenance of joints"". Four other studies reported benefit with no side effects; however, the studies were not extensive, and all recommended further controlled study.   One study found that oral collagen only improved symptoms in a minority of patients and reported nausea as a side effect.  Another study reported no improvement in disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Another study found that collagen treatment may actually cause an exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. 
 Hydrolyzed collagen, like gelatin, is made from animal by-products from the meat industry, including skin, bones, and connective tissue.
In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with support from the TSE (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) Advisory Committee, began monitoring the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. An FDA study from that year stated: ""...steps such as heat, alkaline treatment, and filtration could be effective in reducing the level of contaminating TSE agents; however, scientific evidence is insufficient at this time to demonstrate that these treatments would effectively remove the BSE infectious agent if present in the source material."" On March 18, 2016 the FDA finalized three previously-issued interim final rules designed to further reduce the potential risk of BSE in human food. The final rule clarified that ""gelatin is not considered a prohibited cattle material if it is manufactured using the customary industry processes specified.""The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union in 2003 stated that the risk associated with bovine bone gelatin is very low or zero.In 2006, the European Food Safety Authority stated that the SSC opinion was confirmed, that the BSE risk of bone-derived gelatin was small, and that it recommended removal of the 2003 request to exclude the skull, brain, and vertebrae of bovine origin older than 12 months from the material used in gelatin manufacturing.","Fibroblasts,[cell],29.99,C0016030|Chemotaxis,[celf],19.17,C0008018|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Growth,[orgf],9.74,C0018270|Chondrocyte,[cell],20.24,C0225369|Arthralgia,[sosy],17.80,C0003862|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.02,C1096155|Osteoclasts,[cell],12.89,C0029431|Cartilage,[tisu],11.49,C0007301|Cells,[cell],10.42,C0007634|Bone Density,[clna],9.90,C0005938|Osteoblasts,[cell],9.81,C0029418|Cell Differentiation process,[celf],8.34,C0007589|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],7.45,C0262950|Rheumatoid Arthritis,[dsyn],25.99,C0003873|Nutritional status,[fndg],14.64,C0392209|Nausea,[sosy],13.01,C0027497|Disease,[dsyn],9.74,C0012634|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Maintenance,[acty],6.74,C0024501|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Connective Tissue,[tisu],8.34,C0009780|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],5.18,C0262950|Encephalopathy, Bovine Spongiform,[dsyn],84.94,C0085209|Bone structure of cranium,[bpoc],14.64,C0037303|Prion Diseases,[dsyn],14.64,C0162534|Hydranencephaly with Renal Aplasia-Dysplasia,[dsyn],13.14,C1856053|Brain,[bpoc],11.49,C0006104|Patient Monitoring,[hlca],10.28,C0030695|Communicable Diseases,[dsyn],9.84,C0009450|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],7.00,C0262950|Infection,[patf],6.69,C3714514|Bone structure of spine,[bpoc],3.57,C0549207|Animal Diseases,[dsyn],3.44,C0003047|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.44,C0018837|"
"('gelatin', 'Production')","The worldwide production amount of gelatin is about 375,000 400,000 tonnes per year (830 10^6 880 10^6 lb/a). On a commercial scale, gelatin is made from by-products of the meat and leather industries.
Most gelatin is derived from pork skins, pork and cattle bones, or split cattle hides. Gelatin made from fish by-products avoids some of the religious objections to gelatin consumption. The raw materials are prepared by different curing, acid, and alkali processes that are employed to extract the dried collagen hydrolysate. These processes may take several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products.
Gelatin also can be prepared at home. Boiling certain cartilaginous cuts of meat or bones results in gelatin being dissolved into the water. Depending on the concentration, the resulting stock (when cooled) will form a jelly or gel naturally. This process is used for aspic.
While many processes exist whereby collagen may be converted to gelatin, they all have several factors in common. The intermolecular and intramolecular bonds that stabilize insoluble collagen must be broken, and also, the hydrogen bonds that stabilize the collagen helix must be broken. The manufacturing processes of gelatin consists of several main stages:

Pretreatments to make the raw materials ready for the main extraction step and to remove impurities that may have negative effects on physicochemical properties of the final gelatin product.
Hydrolysis of collagen into gelatin.
Extraction of gelatin from the hydrolysis mixture, which usually is done with hot water or dilute acid solutions as a multistage process.
The refining and recovering treatments including filtration, clarification, evaporation, sterilization, drying, rutting, grinding, and sifting to remove the water from the gelatin solution, to blend the gelatin extracted, and to obtain dried, blended, ground final product.If the raw material used in the production of the gelatin is derived from bones, dilute acid solutions are used to remove calcium and other salts. Hot water or several solvents may be used to reduce the fat content, which should not exceed 1% before the main extraction step. If the raw material consists of hides and skin; size reduction, washing, removal of hair from hides, and degreasing are necessary to prepare the hides and skins for the hydrolysis step.","Consumption of goods,[acty],3.68,C0009830|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],3.68,C0262950|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Cartilage,[tisu],9.74,C0007301|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],5.18,C0262950|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hydrogen Bonding,[npop],7.13,C0020276|Hydrolysis,[npop],6.74,C0020291|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.49,C2350229|Solutions,[sbst],6.70,C0037633|Hydrolysis,[npop],6.66,C0020291|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.33,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.61,C2350229|Solutions,[sbst],13.41,C0037633|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Hydrolysis,[npop],6.59,C0020291|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],3.59,C0262950|"
"('gelatin', 'Uses')","The first use of gelatin in foods is attributed to medieval Britain (1400s) when cattle hooves were boiled to produce a gel. Further commercial development occurred in 1754 when a British manufacturing patent was issued. Food applications in France and the United States during 1800 1900 appear to have established the versatility of gelatin, including the origin of its popularity in the US as Jell-O.  Over middle-late 1800s, Charles and Rose Knox of New York manufactured and marketed gelatin powder, diversifying the appeal and applications of gelatin. 
 Probably best known as a gelling agent in cooking, different types and grades of gelatin are used in a wide range of food and nonfood products. Common examples of foods that contain gelatin are gelatin desserts, trifles, aspic, marshmallows, candy corn, and confections such as Peeps, gummy bears, fruit snacks, and jelly babies. Gelatin may be used as a stabilizer, thickener, or texturizer in foods such as yogurt, cream cheese, and margarine; it is used, as well, in fat-reduced foods to simulate the mouthfeel of fat and to create volume. It also is used in the production of several types of Chinese soup dumplings, specifically Shanghainese soup dumplings, or xiaolongbao, as well as Shengjian mantou, a type of fried and steamed dumpling. The fillings of both are made by combining ground pork with gelatin cubes, and in the process of cooking, the gelatin melts, creating a soupy interior with a characteristic gelatinous stickiness.
Gelatin is used for the clarification of juices, such as apple juice, and of vinegar.
Isinglass is obtained from the swim bladders of fish. It is used as a fining agent for wine and beer. Besides hartshorn jelly, from deer antlers (hence the name ""hartshorn""), isinglass was one of the oldest sources of gelatin. 
 Certain professional and theatrical lighting equipment use color gels to change the beam color. Historically, these were made with gelatin, hence the term, color gel.
Gelatin typically constitutes the shells of drug and vitamin capsules to make them easier to swallow. Hypromellose is a vegetarian-acceptable alternative to gelatin, but is more expensive to produce.
Some animal glues such as hide glue may be unrefined gelatin.
It is used to hold silver halide crystals in an emulsion in virtually all photographic films and photographic papers. Despite significant effort, no suitable substitutes with the stability and low cost of gelatin have been found.
Used as a carrier, coating, or separating agent for other substances, for example, it makes  -carotene water-soluble, thus imparting a yellow color to any soft drinks containing  -carotene.
Ballistic gelatin is used to test and measure the performance of bullets shot from firearms.
Gelatin is used as a binder in match heads and sandpaper.
Cosmetics may contain a non-gelling variant of gelatin under the name hydrolyzed collagen (hydrolysate).
Gelatin was first used as an external surface sizing for paper in 1337 and continued as a dominant sizing agent of all European papers through the mid-nineteenth century. In modern times, it is mostly found in watercolor paper, and occasionally in glossy printing papers, artistic papers, and playing cards. It maintains the wrinkles in cr pe paper.","Hoof,[bpoc],6.83,C0019908|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Cuboid Bone,[bpoc],19.32,C0376381|Melting,[npop],16.25,C0599882|Gingiva,[tisu],16.07,C0017562|Corn of toe,[acab],3.68,C0010046|Antlers,[bpoc],9.99,C0003452|Urinary Bladder,[bpoc],9.86,C0005682|Term Birth,[orgf],20.95,C0233324|Light,[npop],16.07,C0023693|Glues,[sbst],9.86,C0017780|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Carrier of disorder,[fndg],9.88,C0560175|Genetic Carriers,[fndg],9.88,C0007294|Sex Differentiation Disorders,[dsyn],13.09,C2930619|Skin Wrinkling,[fndg],9.86,C0037301|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|"

"('glucosamine hydrochloride', 'Medical uses')","Oral glucosamine is a dietary supplement and is not a prescription drug.  It is illegal in the United States to market any dietary supplement as a treatment for any disease or condition. Glucosamine is marketed as a supplement to support the structure and function of joints, and the marketing is targeted to people suffering from osteoarthritis.Commonly sold forms of glucosamine are glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chondroitin, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine. Of the three commonly available forms of glucosamine, only glucosamine sulfate is given a ""likely effective"" rating for treating osteoarthritis.

"('grape', 'Health claims')","Comparing diets among Western countries, researchers have discovered that although French people tend to eat higher levels of animal fat, the incidence of heart disease remains low in France. This phenomenon has been termed the French paradox, and is thought to occur from protective benefits of regularly consuming red wine, among other dietary practices. Alcohol consumption in moderation may be cardioprotective by its minor anticoagulant effect and vasodilation.

Although adoption of wine consumption is generally not recommended by health authorities, some research indicates moderate consumption, such as one glass of red wine a day for women and two for men, may confer health benefits. Alcohol itself may have protective effects on the cardiovascular system. 
 The consumption of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. Their toxicity to dogs can cause the animal to develop acute renal failure (the sudden development of kidney failure) with anuria (a lack of urine production) and may be fatal.","Term Birth,[orgf],19.75,C0233324|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Vasodilation,[ortf],14.64,C0042401|Alcohol consumption,[inbe],13.10,C0001948|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Heart Diseases,[dsyn],6.65,C0018799|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],13.01,C2676739|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.11,C0009830|Kidney Failure, Acute,[dsyn],20.95,C0022660|Anuria,[dsyn],17.80,C0003460|Kidney Failure,[dsyn],16.07,C0035078|Urine,[bdsu],9.74,C0042036|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|"
"('grape', 'Use in religion')","Christians have traditionally used wine during worship services as a means of remembering the blood of Jesus Christ which was shed for the remission of sins. Christians who oppose the partaking of alcoholic beverages sometimes use grape juice or water as the ""cup"" or ""wine"" in the Lord's Supper.The Catholic Church continues to use wine in the celebration of the Eucharist because it is part of the tradition passed down through the ages starting with Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, where Catholics believe the consecrated bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ, a dogma known as transubstantiation. Wine is used (not grape juice) both due to its strong Scriptural roots, and also to follow the tradition set by the early Christian Church. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church (1983), Canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural, made from grapes of the vine, and not corrupt. In some circumstances, a priest may obtain special permission to use grape juice for the consecration; however, this is extremely rare and typically requires sufficient impetus to warrant such a dispensation, such as personal health of the priest.
Although alcohol is permitted in Judaism, grape juice is sometimes used as an alternative for kiddush on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, and has the same blessing as wine. Many authorities maintain that grape juice must be capable of turning into wine naturally in order to be used for kiddush.

"('grapefruit', 'Drug interactions')","Grapefruit and grapefruit juice have been found to interact with numerous drugs and in many cases, to result in adverse direct and/or side effects (if dosage is not carefully adjusted.)This happens in two very different ways. In the first, the effect is from bergamottin, a natural furanocoumarin in both grapefruit flesh and peel that inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, (among others from the P450 enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs). The action of the CYP3A4 enzyme itself is to metabolize many medications. If the drug's breakdown for removal is lessened, then the level of the drug in the blood may become too high or stay too long, leading to adverse effects. On the other hand, some drugs must be broken down to become active, and inhibiting CYP3A4 may lead to reduced drug effects.
The other effect is that grapefruit can block the absorption of drugs in the intestine. If the drug is not absorbed, then not enough of it is in the blood to have a therapeutic effect. Each affected drug has either a specific increase of effect or decrease.
One whole grapefruit, or a glass of 200 mL (6.8 US fl oz) of grapefruit juice may cause drug overdose toxicity. Typically, drugs that are incompatible with grapefruit are so labeled on the container or package insert. People taking drugs should ask their health care provider or pharmacist questions about grapefruit and drug interactions.","Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],19.90,C0018790|In Blood,[bdsu],17.80,C0005768|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Blood,[bdsu],11.49,C0005767|Lanugo,[bpoc],6.76,C0423866|Catabolism,[orgf],3.56,C0699900|enzyme activity,[moft],3.53,C0243102|In Blood,[bdsu],16.18,C0005768|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.03,C2347023|Intestines,[bpoc],11.49,C0021853|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.10,C0018790|Blood,[bdsu],9.88,C0005767|Therapeutic Effect,[clna],5.18,C1527144|Drug Overdose,[inpo],32.43,C0029944|Drug Interactions,[patf],14.64,C0687133|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],13.02,C2676739|Drug toxicity,[inpo],3.78,C0013221|"

"('hibiscus', 'Uses')","The red hibiscus is the flower of the Hindu goddess Kali, and appears frequently in depictions of her in the art of Bengal, India, often with the goddess and the flower merging in form. The hibiscus is used as an offering to goddess Kali and Lord Ganesha in Hindu worship.In the Philippines, the gumamela (local name for hibiscus) is used by children as part of a bubble-making pastime. The flowers and leaves are crushed until the sticky juices come out. Hollow papaya stalks are then dipped into this and used as straws for blowing bubbles. Together with soap, hibiscus juices produce more bubbles. Also called ""Tarukanga"" in waray particularly in eastern samar province.
The hibiscus flower is traditionally worn by Tahitian and Hawaiian girls. If the flower is worn behind the left ear, the woman is married or has a boyfriend. If the flower is worn on the right, she is single or openly available for a relationship. The yellow hibiscus is Hawaii's state flower.
Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie named her first novel Purple Hibiscus after the delicate flower.
The bark of the hibiscus contains strong bast fibres that can be obtained by letting the stripped bark set in the sea to let the organic material rot away.The hibiscus is a national symbol of Haiti, and the national flower of nations including the Solomon Islands and Niue. Hibiscus syriacus is the national flower of South Korea, and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is the national flower of Malaysia. Hibiscus brackenridgei is the state flower of Hawaii. 
 Many species are grown for their showy flowers or used as landscape shrubs, and are used to attract butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds.Hibiscus is a very hardy, versatile plant and in tropical conditions it can enhance the beauty of any garden. Being versatile it adapts itself easily to balcony gardens in crammed urban spaces and can be easily grown in pots as a creeper or even in hanging pots. It is a perennial and flowers through the year. As it comes in a variety of colors, it's a plant which can add vibrancy to any garden.
The only infestation that gardeners need to be vigilant about is mealybug. Mealybug infestations are easy to spot as it is clearly visible as a distinct white cottony infestation on buds, leaves or even stems. To protect the plant you need to trim away the infected part, spray with water, and apply an appropriate pesticide. 
 One species of Hibiscus, known as kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus), is extensively used in paper-making. 
 The inner bark of the sea hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus), also called 'hau', is used in Polynesia for making rope, and the wood for making canoe floats. The ropes on the missionary ship Messenger of Peace were made of fibres from hibiscus trees. 
 The tea made of the calyces of Hibiscus sabdariffa is known by many names in many countries around the world and is served both hot and cold. The beverage is well known for its red colour, tartness and unique flavour. Additionally, it is highly nutritious because of its vitamin C content.
It is known as bissap in West Africa, ""Gul e Khatmi"" in Urdu & Persian, agua de jamaica in Mexico and Central America (the flower being flor de jamaica) and Orhul in India. Some refer to it as roselle, a common name for the hibiscus flower. In Jamaica, Trinidad and many other islands in the Caribbean, the drink is known as sorrel (Hibiscus sabdariffa; not to be confused with Rumex acetosa, a species sharing the common name sorrel). In Ghana, the drink is known as soobolo in one of the local languages.
In Cambodia, a cold beverage can be prepared by first steeping the petals in hot water until the colors are leached from the petals, then adding lime juice (which turns the beverage from dark brown/red to a bright red), sweeteners (sugar/honey) and finally cold water/ice cubes.
In the Arab world, hibiscus tea is known as karkad  (      ), and is served as both a hot and a cold drink. 
 Dried hibiscus is edible, and it is often a delicacy in Mexico. It can also be candied and used as a garnish, usually for desserts.The roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) is used as a vegetable.
The species Hibiscus suratensis Linn synonymous to Hibiscus aculeatus G. Don is noted in Visayas in the Philippines as being a souring ingredient for almost all local vegetables and menus. Known as labog in the Visayan area, (or labuag/sapinit in Tagalog), the species is an ingredient in cooking native chicken soup.
Hibiscus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including Chionodes hibiscella, Hypercompe hambletoni, the nutmeg moth, and the turnip moth. 
 Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is described as having a number of medical uses in Indian Ayurveda. 
 It has been claimed that sour teas derived from Hibiscus sabdariffa may lower blood pressure. 
 While the mechanism is not well understood, previous animal studies have demonstrated both an inhibitory effect of H. sabdariffa on muscle tone and the anti-fertility effects of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, respectively. The extract of H. sabdariffa has been shown to stimulate contraction of the rat bladder and uterus; the H.rosa-sinensis extract has exhibited contraceptive effects in the form of estrogen activity in rats. These findings have not been observed in humans. The Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is also thought to have emmenagogue effects which can stimulate menstruation and, in some women, cause an abortion. Due to the documented adverse effects in animal studies and the reported pharmacological properties, the H. sabdariffa and H.rosa-sinensis are not recommended for use during pregnancy. 
 It is postulated that H. sabdariffa interacts with diclofenac, chloroquine and acetaminophen by altering the pharmacokinetics. In healthy human volunteers, the H. sabdariffa extract was found to reduce the excretion of diclofenac upon co-administration. Additionally, co-administration of Karkade (H. sabdariffa), a common Sudanese beverage, was found to reduce chloroquine bioavailability. However, no statistically significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen when administered with the Zobo (H.sabdariffa) drink. Further studies are needed to demonstrate clinical significance.","Stalking (behavior),[mobd],16.25,C0935572|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.71,C0332679|Marriage, life event,[fndg],24.11,C0024841|Unmarried,[fndg],24.11,C0087136|Ear structure,[bpoc],9.87,C0013443|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],45.22,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],26.18,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],26.18,C0022655|Set (Psychology),[menp],13.14,C0036849|Fibrosis,[patf],9.85,C0016059|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],19.82,C0024809|Disease,[dsyn],9.85,C0012634|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.38,C0599638|Wakefulness,[menp],14.64,C0043012|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],10.83,C0030499|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.43,C0007776|Wood material,[sbst],13.01,C0043217|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.96,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.96,C0022655|Fibrosis,[patf],9.82,C0016059|Cold Temperature,[npop],24.11,C0009264|Hot Temperature,[npop],24.11,C2350229|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.45,C0682897|Structure of calyx,[bpoc],16.16,C0022651|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0041912|Confusion,[mobd],16.18,C0009676|Cold Temperature,[npop],45.07,C0009264|Common Cold,[dsyn],26.04,C0009443|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.36,C2350229|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],19.69,C0041912|Cuboid Bone,[bpoc],19.28,C0376381|Hot Temperature,[npop],24.11,C2350229|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.43,C0009264|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.96,C0009443|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.81,C0041912|Blood Pressure,[orgf],17.80,C0005823|Systemic arterial pressure,[fndg],17.80,C1272641|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],13.14,C0424320|Estrogen Effect,[fndg],19.33,C0877035|Menstruation,[orgf],14.64,C0025344|Pregnancy,[orgf],14.64,C0032961|Uterus,[bpoc],14.64,C0042149|Comprehension,[menp],12.92,C0162340|Muscle Tonus,[ortf],11.49,C0026841|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Urinary Bladder,[bpoc],9.74,C0005682|"
"('honey', 'Modern uses')","Over its history as a food, the main uses of honey are in cooking, baking, desserts, as a spread on bread, as an addition to various beverages such as tea, and as a sweetener in some commercial beverages. 
 Possibly the world's oldest fermented beverage, dating from 9,000 years ago, mead (""honey wine"") is the alcoholic product made by adding yeast to honey-water must and fermenting it for weeks or months. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used in modern mead production.Primary fermentation usually takes 28 to 56 days, after which the must is placed in a secondary fermentation vessel for 6 to 9 months of aging. Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors, such as floral origin of the honey and its natural sugar and microorganism contents, must water percentage, pH, additives used, and strain of yeast, among others. Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen, salt, or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities, no evidence suggests that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality. Cell immobilization methods, however, proved effective for enhancing mead quality.Mead varieties include drinks called metheglin (with spices or herbs), melomel (with fruit juices, such as grape, specifically called pyment), hippocras (with cinnamon), and sack mead (high concentration of honey), many of which have been developed as commercial products numbering in the hundreds in the United States. Honey is also used to make mead beer, called ""braggot"".","Fermentation,[moft],53.81,C0015852|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.27,C0599638|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],26.13,C0027627|Aging,[orgf],9.86,C0001811|Blood Vessel,[bpoc],6.71,C0005847|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.59,C0080194|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Cells,[cell],3.48,C0007634|"
"('honey', 'Physical and chemical properties')","The physical properties of honey vary, depending on water content, the type of flora used to produce it (pasturage), temperature, and the proportion of the specific sugars it contains. Fresh honey is a supersaturated liquid, containing more sugar than the water can typically dissolve at ambient temperatures. At room temperature, honey is a supercooled liquid, in which the glucose precipitates into solid granules. This forms a semisolid solution of precipitated glucose crystals in a solution of fructose and other ingredients.
The density of honey typically ranges between 1.38 and 1.45 kg/l at 20  C .The average pH of honey is 3.9, but can range from 3.4 to 6.1. Honey contains many kinds of acids, both organic and amino. However, the different types and their amounts vary considerably, depending on the type of honey. These acids may be aromatic or aliphatic (nonaromatic). The aliphatic acids contribute greatly to the flavor of honey by interacting with the flavors of other ingredients.Organic acids comprise most of the acids in honey, accounting for 0.17 1.17% of the mixture, with gluconic acid formed by the actions of glucose oxidase as the most prevalent. Minor amounts of other organic acids are present, consisting of formic, acetic, butyric, citric, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, propionic, valeric, capronic, palmitic, and succinic, among many others.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.02,C0599638|Body Temperature,[orga],32.70,C0005903|Cytoplasmic Granules,[celc],25.62,C0010837|Solutions,[sbst],13.49,C0037633|Physical Phenomenon or Property,[npop],3.61,C0597237|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.73,C0682897|"
"('honey', 'Medical')","Honey is a popular folk treatment for burns and other skin injuries. Preliminary evidence suggests that it aids in the healing of partial thickness burns 4 5 days faster than other dressings, and moderate evidence suggests that post-operative infections treated with honey heal faster and with fewer adverse events than with antiseptic and gauze. The evidence for the use of honey in various other wound treatments is of low quality, and firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Evidence does not support the use of honey-based products for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers or ingrown toenail. 
 Components of honey under preliminary research for their potential antibacterial properties include methylglyoxal, hydrogen peroxide, and royalisin (also called defensin-1). 
 For chronic and acute coughs, a Cochrane review found no strong evidence for or against the use of honey. For treating children, the systematic review concluded with moderate to low evidence that honey probably helps more than no treatment, diphenhydramine, and placebo at giving relief from coughing. Honey does not appear to work better than dextromethorphan at relieving coughing in children.The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommends avoiding giving over-the-counter cough and common cold medication to children under six, and suggests ""a homemade remedy containing honey and lemon is likely to be just as useful and safer to take"", but warns that honey should not be given to babies because of the risk of infant botulism. The World Health Organization recommends honey as a treatment for coughs and sore throats, including for children, stating that no reason exists to believe it is less effective than a commercial remedy. Honey is recommended by one Canadian physician for children over the age of one for the treatment of coughs, as it is deemed as effective as dextromethorphan and more effective than diphenhydramine. 
 The use of honey has been recommended as a temporary intervention for known or suspected button cell battery ingestions to reduce the risk and severity of injury to the esophagus caused by the battery prior to its removal. 
 There is no evidence that honey is beneficial for treating cancer, although honey may be useful for controlling side effects of radiation therapy or chemotherapy used to treat cancer.Consumption is sometimes advocated as a treatment for seasonal allergies due to pollen, but  scientific evidence to support the claim is inconclusive. Honey is generally considered ineffective for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.Although the majority of calories in honey is from fructose, honey does not cause increased weight gain and fructose by itself is not an independent factor for weight gain. 
 Honey is generally safe when taken in typical food amounts, but it may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions in combination with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Included among these are mild reactions to high intake, such as anxiety, insomnia, or hyperactivity in about 10% of children, according to one study. No symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, or hyperactivity were detected with honey consumption compared to placebo, according to another study. Honey consumption may interact adversely with existing allergies, high blood sugar levels (as in diabetes), or anticoagulants used to control bleeding, among other clinical conditions.People who have a weakened immune system may be at risk of bacterial or fungal infection from eating honey, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence that this occurs commonly.Infants can develop botulism after consuming honey contaminated with Clostridium botulinum endospores.Infantile botulism shows geographical variation. In the UK, only six cases were reported between 1976 and 2006, yet the U.S. has much higher rates: 1.9 per 100,000 live births, 47.2% of which are in California. While the risk honey poses to infant health is small, taking the risk is not recommended until after one year of age, and then giving honey is considered safe.

Honey produced from flowers of rhododendrons, mountain laurels, sheep laurel, and azaleas may cause honey intoxication. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, nausea, and vomiting. Less commonly, low blood pressure, shock, heart rhythm irregularities, and convulsions may occur, with rare cases resulting in death. Honey intoxication is more likely when using ""natural"" unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives. Commercial processing, with pooling of honey from numerous sources, is thought to dilute any toxins.Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to tutu bushes (Coriaria arborea) and the vine hopper insect (Scolypopa australis). Both are found throughout New Zealand. Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant. This introduces the poison tutin into honey. Only a few areas in New Zealand (the Coromandel Peninsula, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Marlborough Sounds) frequently produce toxic honey. Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased excitability, stupor, coma, and violent convulsions. To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning, humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand. Since December 2001, New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu, vine hopper, and foraging conditions within 3 km (1.9 mi) of their apiary. Intoxication is rarely dangerous.","Fasting,[fndg],32.76,C0015663|Wound Healing,[orgf],20.12,C0043240|Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,[dsyn],19.31,C0001175|Varicose Ulcer,[dsyn],16.08,C0042344|Nails, Ingrown,[fndg],14.64,C0027343|Burn injury,[inpo],13.34,C0006434|Traumatic injury,[inpo],7.19,C3263723|Infection,[patf],6.79,C3714514|Injury wounds,[inpo],3.50,C0043250|Coughing,[sosy],84.25,C0010200|Botulism, Infantile,[dsyn],16.06,C0238027|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.92,C0009443|Sore Throat,[sosy],11.49,C0242429|Health Care,[hlca],9.77,C0086388|Esophagus,[bpoc],14.64,C0014876|Cells,[cell],3.46,C0007634|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.45,C3263723|Weight Gain,[fndg],45.23,C0043094|Hay fever,[dsyn],19.38,C0018621|Allergic Conjunctivitis,[dsyn],12.91,C0009766|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],7.25,C0006826|Consumption of goods,[acty],5.18,C0009830|Sleeplessness,[sosy],35.81,C0917801|Disease,[dsyn],30.14,C0012634|Anxiety,[mobd],19.94,C0003467|Live Birth,[fndg],19.35,C0481667|Botulism, Infantile,[dsyn],17.80,C0238027|Botulism,[inpo],16.18,C0006057|Hyperglycemia,[dsyn],14.64,C0020456|Anxiety Disorders,[mobd],13.59,C0003469|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],13.05,C0011849|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Hemorrhage,[patf],11.49,C0019080|Consumption of goods,[acty],11.08,C0009830|Mycoses,[dsyn],6.76,C0026946|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Disease,[dsyn],40.71,C0012634|Eating,[orgf],39.33,C0013470|Sleeplessness,[sosy],35.81,C0917801|Dizziness,[sosy],33.46,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],33.46,C0042571|Vomiting,[sosy],29.46,C0042963|Convulsions,[sosy],26.74,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],26.74,C0036572|Urticaria,[dsyn],26.06,C0042109|Comatose,[dsyn],24.11,C0009421|Stupor,[mobd],24.11,C0085628|Delirium,[mobd],20.95,C0011206|Anxiety,[mobd],19.94,C0003467|Sweating,[fndg],16.30,C0038990|Apraxia, oculomotor, Cogan type,[cgab],14.64,C0543874|Hyperglycemia,[dsyn],14.64,C0020456|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Anxiety Disorders,[mobd],13.59,C0003469|Poisoning,[inpo],13.25,C0032343|Sound - physical agent,[npop],13.14,C0037709|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],13.05,C0011849|Violence,[mobd],12.91,C0042693|Hemorrhage,[patf],11.49,C0019080|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Shock,[patf],11.49,C0036974|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Consumption of goods,[acty],11.08,C0009830|Patient Monitoring,[hlca],10.28,C0030695|Sweat,[bdsu],9.99,C0038984|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Anger,[menp],9.77,C0002957|Mycoses,[dsyn],6.76,C0026946|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Heart,[bpoc],6.63,C0018787|"
"('honey', 'History and culture')","Honey use and production has a long and varied history. In many cultures, honey has associations that go beyond its use as a food. It was used medicinally and for embalming, and frequently used as a talisman and symbol of sweetness, with religious meaning.In myths and folk medicine, honey was used both orally and topically to treat various ailments including gastric disturbances, ulcers, skin wounds, and skin burns by ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine.Proposed for treating wounds and burns, honey may have antimicrobial properties as first reported in 1892 and be useful as a safe, improvizational wound treatment. Though its supposed antimicrobial properties may be due to high osmolarity even when diluted with water, it is more effective than plain sugar water of a similar viscosity. Definitive clinical conclusions about the efficacy and safety of treating wounds, however, are not possible from this limited research.The flowers  that bees use to make the honey may have a role in its properties. One study proposes that the honey produced by bees foraging from the manuka myrtle, Leptospermum scoparium has distinctive properties.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.10,C0599638|Mental association,[menp],14.64,C0004083|Injury wounds,[inpo],14.47,C0043250|Burn injury,[inpo],13.83,C0006434|Stomach,[bpoc],12.96,C0038351|Ulcer,[patf],11.49,C0041582|Osmolarity,[clna],6.71,C0029387|Viscosity,[npop],6.57,C0042784|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.42,C3263723|"
"('hops', 'Other uses')","In addition to beer, hops are used in herbal teas and in soft drinks.

Hops can be eaten, the young shoots of the vine are edible and can be cooked similar to asparagus.Hops may be used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. A pillow filled with hops is a popular folk remedy for sleeplessness, and animal research has shown a sedative effect. The relaxing effect of hops may be due, in part, to the specific degradation product from alpha acids, 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, as demonstrated from nighttime consumption of non-alcoholic beer. 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol is structurally similar to tert-amyl alcohol which was historically used as an anesthetic.

"('horny goat weed', 'Cultivation')","Some varieties and hybrids have been in western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the west, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. Few genera of plants have seen such a dramatic increase in newly discovered species, primarily thanks to the work of Mikinori Ogisu of Japan and Darrell Probst of Massachusetts. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation.Hugely popular as garden plants for centuries in Japan, epimediums are only just beginning to garner attention in the West. While they vary somewhat in their respective hardiness, all are essentially dwellers of the forest floor, and, as such, all require fundamentally similar conditions of moist, free-draining, humus-rich soil and cool shade, with some shelter for the newly emerging leaves. Some of the more robust varieties are often recommended as plants for dry shade, and whilst their tough foliage and stout rhizomes can allow them to grow successfully in such conditions, (and in more open, exposed positions too, in some instances) they will certainly not give their best. Furthermore, dryness and exposure will pretty much guarantee the early death of many of the newer and more delicate species.
Given suitable conditions most epimediums will form beautiful groundcover plants, often with magnificent new leaves tinted in bronze, copper and reds combining with a huge variety of flower colours and forms in spring. Handsome and dense-growing foliage remains present for much of the year, with the leaves often turning purple, crimson and scarlet in autumn in some forms, and remaining evergreen in others. With all varieties, however, the foliage is best cut off at ground level shortly before new leaves emerge, so as to fully reveal their beauty of form and colour. Ideally, a mulch should then be applied to protect the new growth from frosts.","Disease,[dsyn],30.07,C0012634|Desiccation,[npop],19.96,C0011682|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Forests,[npop],16.04,C0086312|Soil,[sbst],13.09,C0037592|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Humus,[sbst],12.94,C1258025|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.85,C0011065|Natural Springs,[npop],12.97,C3179043|Disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0012634|Neoplasms,[neop],3.61,C0027651|"

Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is also known as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a sensitive spot test for ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to test for alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a test for starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform test for methyl ketones. The iodine test for starch is still used to detect counterfeit banknotes printed on starch-containing paper. 
 About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds, another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.The spectra of the iodine molecule, I2, consists of (not exclusively) tens of thousands of sharp spectral lines in the wavelength range 500 700 nm. It is therefore a commonly used wavelength reference (secondary standard). By measuring with a spectroscopic Doppler-free technique while focusing on one of these lines, the hyperfine structure of the iodine molecule reveals itself. A line is now resolved such that either 15 components, (from even rotational quantum numbers, Jeven), or 21 components (from odd rotational quantum numbers, Jodd) are measurable.

Elemental iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency.In the alternative, iodine may be produced from iodophors, which contain iodine complexed with a solubilizing agent (the iodide ion may be thought of loosely as the iodophor in triiodide water solutions). Examples of such preparations include:
Tincture of iodine: iodine in ethanol, or iodine and sodium iodide in a mixture of ethanol and water.
Lugol's iodine: iodine and iodide in water alone, forming mostly triiodide. Unlike tincture of iodine, Lugol's iodine has a minimised amount of the free iodine (I2) component.
Povidone iodine (an iodophor).The antimicrobial action of iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, and thus it is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.

It is also used to block uptake of iodine-131 in the thyroid gland (see isotopes section above), when this isotope is used as part of radiopharmaceuticals (such as iobenguane) that are not targeted to the thyroid or thyroid-type tissues.Iodine-131 (usually as iodide) is a component of nuclear fallout, and is particularly dangerous owing to the thyroid gland's propensity to concentrate ingested iodine and retain it for periods longer than this isotope's radiological half-life of eight days. For this reason, people at risk of exposure to environmental radioactive iodine (iodine-131) in fallout may be instructed to take non-radioactive potassium iodide tablets. The typical adult dose is one 130 mg tablet per 24 hours, supplying 100 mg (100,000 micrograms) of ionic iodine. (The typical daily dose of iodine for normal health is of order 100 micrograms; see ""Dietary Intake"" below.) Ingestion of this large dose of non-radioactive iodine minimises the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland.

As an element with high electron density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3 keV due to the photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.

Another significant use is a catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.Inorganic iodides find specialised uses. Titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and thorium are purified by the van Arkel process, which involves the reversible formation of the tetraiodides of these elements. Silver iodide is a major ingredient to traditional photographic film. Thousands of kilograms of silver iodide are used annually for cloud seeding to induce rain.The organoiodine compound erythrosine is an important food coloring agent. Perfluoroalkyl iodides are precursors to important surfactants, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.","Pigmentation,[orga],14.64,C0031911|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.14,C0021467|Smog,[npop],9.81,C0037365|Solutions,[sbst],6.77,C0037633|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.71,C0020517|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.13,C0014518|Pigmentation,[orga],14.64,C0031911|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.14,C0021467|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.96,C0027627|Smog,[npop],9.81,C0037365|Visual Accommodation,[ortf],6.71,C0000936|Drinking Water,[sbst],68.26,C0599638|Disinfectants,[sbst],16.18,C0012682|Pigmentation,[orga],14.64,C0031911|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.14,C0021467|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.99,C0162429|Thinking, function,[menp],9.90,C0039869|Smog,[npop],9.81,C0037365|Solutions,[sbst],6.58,C0037633|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.38,C0599638|Cell Death,[celf],6.91,C0007587|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Tissue membrane,[tisu],6.59,C0025255|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Thyroid Gland,[bpoc],52.09,C0040132|Vision,[orgf],35.81,C0042789|Radioactivity,[npop],27.32,C0034553|Pigmentation,[orga],14.64,C0031911|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.14,C0021467|Thyrotoxicosis,[dsyn],13.14,C0040156|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.10,C0018790|Smog,[npop],9.81,C0037365|Solutions,[sbst],6.71,C0037633|Body tissue,[tisu],3.63,C0040300|Roentgen Rays,[npop],49.50,C0043309|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.39,C0599638|Rain,[npop],20.95,C0034640|Pigmentation,[orga],14.64,C0031911|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.14,C0021467|Smog,[npop],9.81,C0037365|Hydrolysis,[npop],6.71,C0020291|"
"('iodine', 'Toxicity')","Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The lethal dose for an adult human is 30 mg/kg, which is about 2.1 2.4 grams for a human weighing 70 to 80 kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000 mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic in the presence of selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).Elemental iodine is also a skin irritant, and direct contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine crystals should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.People can be exposed to iodine in the workplace by inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for iodine exposure in the workplace at 0.1 ppm (1 mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.1 ppm (1 mg/m3) during an 8-hour workday. At levels of 2 ppm, iodine is immediately dangerous to life and health.

Applications of tincture of iodine or Betadine can cause rashes, sometimes severe. Parenteral use of iodine-based contrast agents (see above) can cause reactions ranging from a mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis. Such reactions have led to the misconception (widely held, even among physicians) that some people are allergic to iodine itself; even allergies to iodine-rich seafood have been so construed. In fact, there has never been a confirmed report of a true iodine allergy, and an allergy to elemental iodine or simple iodide salts is theoretically impossible. Hypersensitivity reactions to products and foods containing iodine are apparently related to their other molecular components; thus, a person who has demonstrated an allergy to one food or product containing iodine may not have an allergic reaction to another. Patients with various food allergies (shellfish, egg, milk, etc.) or asthma are more likely to suffer reactions to contrast media containing iodine. As with all medications, the patient's allergy history should be questioned and consulted before any containing iodine are administered.","Set (Psychology),[menp],29.46,C0036849|Inspiration function,[orgf],16.05,C0004048|Eating,[orgf],13.05,C0013470|Eye,[bpoc],12.96,C0015392|Chemical Burns,[inpo],9.95,C0006435|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.73,C0162429|Solutions,[sbst],6.71,C0037633|Body tissue,[tisu],3.43,C0040300|Mental concentration,[menp],3.43,C0086045|Hypersensitivity,[patf],52.09,C0020517|Allergic Reaction,[patf],27.46,C1527304|Food Allergy,[patf],26.12,C0016470|Exanthema,[sosy],20.16,C0015230|Asthma,[dsyn],17.80,C0004096|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Ovum,[cell],14.64,C0029974|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],13.14,C0002792|Eating,[orgf],13.05,C0013470|Consultation,[hlca],13.02,C0009818|Chemical Burns,[inpo],9.95,C0006435|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.73,C0162429|Solutions,[sbst],6.71,C0037633|Body tissue,[tisu],3.43,C0040300|Mental concentration,[menp],3.43,C0086045|"
"('lactobacillus', 'Human health')","The female genital tract is one of the principal colonisation sites for human microbiota, and there is interest in the relationship between the composition of these bacteria and human health, with a domination by a single species being correlated with general welfare and good outcomes in pregnancy. In around 70% of women, a Lactobacillus species is dominant, although that has been found to vary between American women of European origin and those of African origin, the latter group tending to have more diverse vaginal microbiota. Similar differences have also been identified in comparisons between Belgian and Tanzanian women. 
 Lactobacillus species produce hydrogen peroxide which inhibits the growth and virulence of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies have also shown that Lactobacillus sp. reduce the pathogenicity of C. albicans through the production of organic acids and certain metabolites. Both the presence of metabolites, such as sodium butyrate, and the decrease in environmental pH caused by the organic acids reduce the growth of hypha in C. albicans, which reduces its pathogenicity. Lactobacillus sp. also reduce the pathogenicity of C. albicans by reducing C. albicans biofilm formation. Biofilm formation is reduced by both the competition from Lactobacillus sp., and the formation of defective biofilms which is linked to the reduced hypha growth mentioned earlier. On the other hand, following antibiotic therapy, certain Candida species can suppress the regrowth of Lactobacillus sp. at body sites where they cohabitate, such as in the gastrointestinal tract.In addition to its effects on C. albicans, Lactobacillus sp. also interact with other pathogens. For example, Lactobacillus reuteri can inhibit the growth of many different bacterial species by using glycerol to produce the antimicrobial substance called reuterin. Another example is Lactobacillus salivarius, which interacts with many pathogens through the production of salivaricin B, a bacteriocin. 
 Lactobacillus species administered in combination with other probiotics benefits cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the extent of efficacy is still uncertain. The probiotics help treat IBS by returning homeostasis when the gut microbiota experiences unusually high levels of opportunistic bacteria. In addition, Lactobacillus species can be administered as probiotics during cases of infection by the ulcer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Helicobacter pylori is linked to cancer, and antibiotic resistance impedes the success of current antibiotic-based eradication treatments. When Lactobacillus probiotics are administered along with the treatment as an adjuvant, its efficacy is substantially increased and side effects may be lessened. Also, Lactobacillus is used to help control urogenital and vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). Lactobacillus produce bacteriocins to suppress pathogenic growth of certain bacteria, as well as lactic acid and H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). Lactic acid lowers the vaginal pH to around 4.5 or less, hampering the survival of other bacteria, and H2O2 reestablishes the normal bacterial microbiota and normal vaginal pH. In children, Lactobacillus strains such as L. rhamnosus are associated with a reduction of atopic eczema, also known as dermatitis, due to anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by this probiotic bacteria..In addition, lactobacillus with other probiotic organisms in ripen milk and yogurt progress the immunity  in the mucous intestine in humans through rising the number of LgA (+) 
 Some Lactobacillus species have been associated with cases of dental caries (cavities). Lactic acid can corrode teeth, and the Lactobacillus count in saliva has been used as a ""caries test"" for many years. Lactobacilli characteristically cause existing carious lesions to progress, especially those in coronal caries. The issue is, however, complex, as recent studies show probiotics can allow beneficial lactobacilli to populate sites on teeth, preventing streptococcal pathogens from taking hold and inducing dental decay. The scientific research of lactobacilli in relation to oral health is a new field and only a few studies and results have been published. Some studies have provided evidence of certain Lactobacilli which can be a probiotic for oral health. Some species, but not all, show evidence in defense to dental caries. Due to these studies, there have been applications of incorporating such probiotics in chewing gum and lozenges. There is also evidence of certain Lactobacilli that are beneficial in the defense of periodontal disease such as gingivitis and periodontitis.","Unmarried,[fndg],22.35,C0087136|Pregnancy Outcome,[fndg],16.24,C0032972|Vagina,[bpoc],12.93,C0042232|Female genitalia,[bpoc],11.49,C0017421|Pathogenicity,[orga],43.16,C1136169|Growth,[orgf],40.93,C0018270|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],20.48,C0018790|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Vagina,[bpoc],39.42,C0042232|Irritable Bowel Syndrome,[dsyn],38.97,C0022104|Bacterial Vaginosis,[dsyn],20.95,C0085166|Uncertainty,[fndg],19.45,C0087130|Antibiotic Resistance, Microbial,[orga],17.80,C0949285|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Infection,[patf],13.45,C3714514|Dermatitis, Atopic,[dsyn],13.04,C0011615|Dermatitis,[dsyn],9.90,C0011603|Growth,[orgf],9.87,C0018270|Ulcer,[patf],9.77,C0041582|Communicable Diseases,[dsyn],9.75,C0009450|Intestines,[bpoc],9.74,C0021853|Mucous body substance,[bdsu],9.74,C0026727|Continuance of life,[acty],6.71,C0038952|Pathogenicity,[orga],6.54,C1136169|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.59,C0006826|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.56,C0080194|Dental caries,[dsyn],102.64,C0011334|Tooth structure,[bpoc],26.30,C0040426|Oral health,[fndg],19.98,C0029162|Gingivitis,[dsyn],17.80,C0017574|Periodontitis,[dsyn],14.64,C0031099|Periodontal Diseases,[dsyn],9.75,C0031090|saliva,[bdsu],9.74,C0036087|Pathogenicity,[orga],6.63,C1136169|"

"('l-tryptophan', 'Use as a dietary supplement')","Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. This is because the transport system that brings tryptophan across the blood brain barrier also transports other amino acids which are contained in protein food sources. High blood plasma levels of other large neutral amino acids prevent the plasma concentration of tryptophan from increasing brain concentration levels.In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence.","Brain,[bpoc],30.02,C0006104|Mental Depression,[mobd],25.98,C0011570|Plasma,[bdsu],25.94,C0032105|Depressive disorder,[mobd],19.63,C0011581|Muscle Rigidity,[sosy],19.33,C0026837|In Blood,[bdsu],16.09,C0005768|Biological Transport,[celf],13.71,C0005528|Depressive Symptoms,[sosy],13.10,C0086132|Standard of Care,[hlca],13.02,C2936643|Eating,[orgf],12.96,C0013470|Blood - brain barrier anatomy,[bpoc],12.94,C0005854|Major Depressive Disorder,[mobd],12.89,C1269683|Diet therapy,[hlca],11.49,C0012159|Sleep,[orgf],9.81,C0037313|Blood,[bdsu],9.78,C0005767|Unipolar Depression,[mobd],9.74,C0041696|Inclusion Bodies,[celc],9.74,C0007637|Anxiety Disorders,[mobd],8.34,C0003469|Mental concentration,[menp],7.21,C0086045|Mood (psychological function),[menp],5.18,C0026516|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|"

Lycopene may affect the immune system, the nervous system, sensitivity to sunlight, or drugs used for stomach ailments.Lycopenemia is an orange discoloration of the skin that is observed with high intakes of lycopene. The discoloration is expected to fade after discontinuing excessive lycopene intake.","Affect (mental function),[menp],23.12,C0001721|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Blood Pressure,[orgf],17.80,C0005823|Muscle Cramp,[sosy],17.80,C0026821|Systemic arterial pressure,[fndg],17.80,C1272641|Anorexia,[dsyn],14.64,C0003123|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Drug Interactions,[patf],13.11,C0687133|Stomach,[bpoc],13.03,C0038351|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.88,C0012159|Hemorrhage,[patf],9.75,C0019080|Allergic Reaction,[patf],6.76,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.76,C0020517|Neurological observations,[fndg],5.18,C0422837|Photosensitivity of skin,[patf],5.18,C0349506|"

"('maca', 'Uses and preparation')","Maca is mainly grown for consumption of its root. The majority of harvested maca is dried. In this form, the hypocotyls can be stored for several years. In Peru, maca is prepared and consumed in various ways, although traditionally it is always cooked. The freshly harvested hypocotyl may be roasted in a pit (called huatia), and is considered a delicacy. Fresh roots usually are available only in the vicinity of the growers. The root can also be mashed and boiled to produce a sweet, thick liquid, then dried and mixed with milk to form a porridge, mazamorra. The cooked roots are also used with other vegetables in empanadas, jams, or soups. The root may be ground to produce a flour for bread, cakes, or pancakes. If fermented, a weak beer called chicha de maca may be produced. In 2010, a U.S.-based brewery called Andean Brewing Company, became the first company to produce and commercialize beer made from maca under the brand KUKA Beer. From the black morphotype, a liquor is produced. Also, the leaves are edible or may serve as animal fodder. They can be prepared raw in salads or cooked much like Lepidium sativum and L. campestre, to which it is closely related genetically.

The prominent product for export is maca flour, which is a baking flour ground from the hard, dried roots. It is called harina de maca. Maca flour (powder) is a relatively inexpensive bulk commodity, much like wheat flour or potato flour. The supplement industry uses both the dry roots and maca flour for different types of processing and concentrated extracts.  Another common form is maca processed by gelatinization. This extrusion process  separates and removes the tough fiber from the roots using gentle heat and pressure, as raw maca is difficult to digest due to its thick fibers and goitrogen content.
There is archaeological evidence for varying degrees of cultivation of maca in the Lake Junin region from around 1700 BC to 1200 AD. Maca has been harvested and used by humans in the puna grasslands of the Andean Mountains for centuries. Contrary to frequent claims that maca's cultivation was common in what is today Peru, until the late 1980s, maca has been cultivated only in a limited area around Lake Junin, in central Peru. Historically, maca often was traded for lowland tropical food staples, such as corn, rice, manioc (tapioca roots), quinoa, and papaya. It also was used as a form of payment of Spanish imperial taxes.Maca has been marketed for its supposed traditional medicinal effects, although there is insufficient evidence that it has any effect on human health or disease. A 2016 systematic review found limited evidence from a small number of studies to improve semen quality in healthy and infertile men. A 2011 review found no good evidence for the effectiveness of maca as a treatment for menopausal symptoms, with no evidence of its safety.","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],50.01,C0040452|Desiccation,[npop],20.69,C0011682|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.21,C0026131|Van der Woude syndrome,[dsyn],13.03,C0175697|Amniotic Fluid,[bdsu],11.49,C0002638|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],11.49,C0033095|Desiccation,[npop],9.81,C0011682|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.68,C0018837|Infertility,[patf],12.96,C0021359|Alzheimer disease, familial, type 3,[dsyn],12.89,C1843013|Disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0012634|Corn of toe,[acab],5.18,C0010046|"
"('manganese', 'Applications')","Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel. Often ferromanganese (usually about 80% manganese) is the intermediate in modern processes.
Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863 MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel (mangalloy). It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military. 
 Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.The second largest application for manganese is in aluminium alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese. 
 Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes.Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.Manganese(IV) oxide (manganese dioxide, MnO2) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols (where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring). Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination. MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints. In some preparations, it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber.
Manganese(IV) oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.
MnO2 + H2O + e    MnO(OH) + OH The same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which use the same basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000 tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.

The metal is occasionally used in coins; until 2000, the only United States coin to use manganese was the ""wartime"" nickel from 1942 to 1945. An alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins. However, because of shortage of nickel metal during the war, it was substituted by more available silver and manganese, thus resulting in an alloy of 56% copper, 35% silver and 9% manganese. Since 2000, dollar coins, for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential $1 coins, are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core. In both cases of nickel and dollar, the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines. In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins, the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper/nickel alloy used in the previous Susan B. Anthony dollar. 
Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass. In 2009, Professor Mas Subramanian and associates at Oregon State University discovered that manganese can be combined with yttrium and indium to form an intensely blue, non-toxic, inert, fade-resistant pigment, YInMn blue, the first new blue pigment discovered in 200 years.
Tetravalent manganese is used as an activator in red-emitting phosphors. While many compounds are known which show luminescence, the majority are not used in commercial application due to low efficiency or deep red emission. However, several Mn4+ activated fluorides were reported as potential red-emitting phosphors for warm-white LEDs. But to this day, only K2SiF6:Mn4+ is commercially available for use in warm-white LEDs.Manganese oxide is also used in Portland cement mixtures.","Melting,[npop],16.09,C0599882|Fever,[sosy],13.03,C0015967|Mental concentration,[menp],3.56,C0086045|Corrosion,[npop],20.36,C0010106|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.85,C0027627|Pigmentation,[orga],13.02,C0031911|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],12.89,C2676739|Desiccation,[npop],9.87,C0011682|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.75,C0030685|Desiccation,[npop],9.85,C0011682|Cells,[cell],7.01,C0007634|Cells,[cell],3.63,C0007634|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Electromagnetics,[npop],9.74,C0013838|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],53.74,C2676739|Pigmentation,[orga],39.89,C0031911|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],12.94,C1096155|luminescence,[npop],20.95,C1450275|Dental Cementum,[bdsu],16.18,C0011343|"

The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.Excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease.","Osteogenesis,[ortf],30.42,C0029433|Parkinson Disease,[dsyn],19.25,C0030567|Manganese Poisoning,[inpo],13.05,C0677050|Kidney,[bpoc],11.49,C0022646|Brain,[bpoc],9.99,C0006104|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.94,C0011065|Disease,[dsyn],9.88,C0012634|Dopaminergic Neurons,[cell],9.81,C1512035|Astrocytes,[cell],9.74,C0004112|Neurodegenerative Disorders,[dsyn],8.34,C0524851|Liver,[bpoc],6.72,C0023884|Metabolism,[orgf],3.68,C0025519|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],3.57,C0262950|Body tissue,[tisu],3.48,C0040300|"
"('manganese', 'Environmental health concerns')","Waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese. According to results from a 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure due to inhaling the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk. However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess. 
 Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is a gasoline additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines to improve the octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through the action of the carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped.

More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610  g Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160  g Mn/L well.

"('mangosteen', 'Uses')","Due to restrictions on imports, mangosteen is not readily available in certain countries. Although available in Australia and New Zealand, for example, they are still rare in the produce sections of grocery stores in North America. Following export from its natural growing regions in Southeast Asia, the fresh fruit may be available seasonally in some local markets like those of Chinatowns.Mangosteens are available canned and frozen in Western countries. Without fumigation or irradiation (in order to kill the Asian fruit fly) fresh mangosteens were illegal to import into the United States until 2007. Freeze-dried and dehydrated mangosteen flesh can also be found.
Upon arrival in the US in 2007, fresh mangosteens sold at up to $60 per pound in specialty produce stores in New York City, but wider availability and somewhat lower prices have become common in the United States and Canada. Despite efforts described above to grow mangosteen in the Western Hemisphere, nearly the entire supply is imported from Thailand.Before ripening, the mangosteen shell is fibrous and firm, but becomes soft and easy to pry open when the fruit ripens. To open a mangosteen, the shell can be scored with a knife, pried gently along the score with the thumbs until it cracks, and then pulled apart to reveal the fruit. Alternatively, the mangosteen can be opened without a knife by squeezing the shell from the bottom until it breaks, allowing the shell to be removed and the fruit eaten while intact with the stem. Occasionally, during peeling of ripe fruits, the purple exocarp juice may stain skin or fabric. In Vietnam, the ripe fruit is also used as a salad ingredient. 
 Various parts of the plant have a history of use in traditional medicine, mostly in Southeast Asia; it may have been used to treat skin infections, wounds, dysentery, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal complaints, although there is no high-quality clinical evidence for any of these effects.
Dried fruits are shipped to Singapore to be processed for medical uses which may include dysentery, skin disorders, and various other minor diseases in several countries across Asia. There is no reliable evidence that mangosteen juice, puree, bark or extracts is effective as a treatment for human diseases. 
 The extract of mangosteen peels are traditionally used in Indonesia as the source of natural dye for textile colouring; to acquire brown, dark brown, purple to red hues, especially applied in traditional tenun ikat and batik textiles.

"('maritime pine', 'Invasiveness')","Pinus pinaster is particularly successful in regions with fynbos vegetation because it is adapted to high-intensity fires, thus allowing it to outcompete other species that are not as well adapted to high-intensity fires. In areas of fire-prone shrubland, the cones of P. pinaster will release seeds when in a relatively high-temperature environment for germination as a recovery mechanism. This adaptation increases the competitive ability of P. pinaster amongst other species in the fire-prone shrubland.  In a 3-year observational study done in Northwestern Spain, P. pinaster showed a naturally high regeneration rate. Observations showed a mean of 25.25 seedlings per square metre within the first year and then slowly decreased the next two years due to intraspecific competition.  So not only does P. pinaster compete with other species, they also compete within their own species as well. When the height of P. pinaster increased there was a negative correlation with the number of P. pinaster seedlings, results showed a decrease in P. pinaster seedlings (r= 0.41, p<0.05).Several other characteristics contribute to their success in the regions they have invaded, including their ability to grow rapidly and to produce small seeds with large wings. Their ability to grow quickly with short juvenile periods allows them to outcompete many native species while their small seeds aids in their dispersal. The small seeds with large wings are beneficial for wind dispersal, which is the key to reaching new areas in regions with fynbos vegetation.   Vertebrate seed dispersers are not commonly found in mountain fynbos vegetation; therefore those species that require the aid of vertebrate dispersal would be at a disadvantage in such an environment. For this reason, the small seed, low seed wing loading, and high winds found in mountainous regions all combine to provide a favorable situation for the dispersal of P. pinaster seeds.  Without this efficient dispersal strategy, P. pinaster would not have been able to reach and invade areas, such as South Africa, that are suitable for its growth. Its dispersal ability is one of the key factors that have allowed P. pinaster to become such a successful invasive species.In addition to being an efficient disperser, P. pinaster is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the large pine weevil. According to an experiment done in Spain, the resin canal density was twice as high in the P. pinaster seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since P. pinaster has the ability to regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the P. pinaster less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when P. pinaster is under attack. In other words, P. pinaster does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of P. pinaster survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of P. pinaster and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of P. pinaster in this region of the world.","Ability,[orga],103.04,C0085732|Environmental Wind,[npop],45.18,C0043187|Fire - disasters,[phpr],40.42,C0016141|Acclimatization,[orgf],26.40,C0000934|Retinal Cone,[cell],22.48,C0206428|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Growth,[orgf],19.74,C0018270|Intention - mental process,[menp],19.59,C0162425|Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,[dsyn],19.34,C0001175|Patient observation,[hlca],17.80,C0700325|Defense Mechanisms,[menp],13.44,C0011142|Fever,[sosy],13.04,C0015967|Flatulence,[sosy],12.90,C0016204|Reproduction,[orgf],11.49,C0035150|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Seed Dispersal,[npop],9.74,C2936468|Disease,[dsyn],9.72,C0012634|Natural regeneration,[ortf],6.62,C0034963|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|"

An NMR study has also found detectable levels of MSM normally present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that it derives from dietary sources, intestinal bacterial metabolism, and the body's endogenous methanethiol metabolism.Published clinical trials of MSM did not report any serious side effects, but there are no peer-reviewed data on the effects of its long-term use in humans.","Body Weight,[orga],45.04,C0005910|In Blood,[bdsu],32.56,C0005768|Blood,[bdsu],19.87,C0005767|Term Birth,[orgf],19.30,C0233324|Blood - brain barrier anatomy,[bpoc],14.64,C0005854|Cerebrospinal Fluid,[bdsu],14.64,C0007806|Intestines,[bpoc],9.78,C0021853|Metabolism,[orgf],7.29,C0025519|Longterm Effects,[phpr],6.59,C0023983|"
"('methylsulfonylmethane', 'Medical and dietary use')","Although no medical uses for MSM have been approved by any government, a variety of health benefits have been claimed and studied. Stanley W. Jacob reported having administered MSM to over 18,000 patients with a variety of ailments; he co-authored a book promoting MSM with a variety of claims, including a utility as a natural source of ""biologically active sulfur,"" suggesting that people are deficient in such forms of sulfur in their dietary intake. There is no Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) or Daily Value established for sulfur and sufficient dietary sources are readily available in onions, garlic and cruciferous vegetables and in protein-containing foods, including nuts, seeds, milk and eggs (whites and yolks).The claims for the need for sulfur supplementation originate with Robert Herschler, a biochemist who patented ""Dietary and pharmaceutical uses of methylsulfonylmethane and compositions comprising it"" in 1982; he claimed that MSM was useful in stress, mucous-membrane inflammation, allergies and gastrointestinal conditions.Moreover, in cases involving topical therapeutics, the role of MSM as an active agent, per se, versus its having a role in promoting skin permeation (in manner, akin to its solvent relative DMSO) must be characterized/controlled.
The biochemical effects of supplemental methylsulfonylmethane are poorly understood. Some researchers have suggested that MSM has anti-inflammatory effects. 
The spectrum of biological effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MSM differ, but those of DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM.In July 2007 a manufacturer of MSM submitted a notification to the U.S. FDA claiming generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. GRAS status is for safety, and has no evaluation of efficacy. The FDA responded in February 2008 with a letter of non-objection, functionally designating OptiMSM, the branded form of MSM, as GRAS. The designation allows MSM to be added to meal supplement and meal replacement foods, fruit smoothie-type drinks, fruit-flavored thirst quencher-type beverages, and food bars such as granola bars and energy-type bars.

The spectrum of biological effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and MSM differ, but those of DMSO may be mediated, at least in part, by MSM.Small-scale studies of possible treatments with MSM have been conducted on both animals and humans. These studies of MSM have suggested some benefits, particularly for treatment of oxidative stress and osteoarthritis, but evidence for other uses is lacking. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database contains a continually updated list of health-related MSM studies.Extensive research in animal models indicates MSM has a very low toxicity when administered both orally and topically.In clinical trials, several studies reported minimal or absence of side effects after 12 weeks of dosing. Reported side effects from these studies included mild gastrointestinal issues, fatigue, and headache, although they did not appear to differ from placebo. A more recent 26-week study on large joint osteoarthritis observed no adverse events or abnormal changes in lab monitoring when taking 6 grams MSM per day. MSM is considered 'Possibly Safe' at therapeutic doses, although further research is still needed to assess its safety for long-term use.

The two trials included 168 people, of whom 52 received MSM, either 1.5 g/day or 6.0 g/day. The review authors stated: ""No definitive conclusion can currently be drawn"" and there is ""no definitive evidence that MSM is superior to placebo in the treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee.Subsequent to the 2008 review there have been two more clinical trials : 

One was a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial with 49 participants taking 1.125 g of MSM or placebo three times daily for 12 weeks. The results showed a significant decrease in WOMAC physical function and total WOMAC scores, as well as improvement in VAS pain scores. The effect size of MSM supplementation was slightly lower than that of NSAID use as reported in other clinical trials. The authors wrote ""longer-term trials may yield additional and greater improvements.""
The second used 6.0 g/day versus placebo for 26 weeks. Subjects were evaluated through the WOMAC questionnaire, SF-36 Quality of Life survey, and Global Assessments for OA symptoms from both patients and physicians. WOMAC results showed significant improvements in all areas for the MSM group. The MSM group also showed a strong trend towards changes in disease status. Careful lab monitoring of health indicators showed no side effects of MSM supplementation and no adverse events were reported.There are findings from Indian researchers that show an improvement of symptoms like pain, inflammation and swelling in patients by a combined intake of MSM and glucosamine.

In a second small trial the total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased after taking MSM. Studies in animals indicate a hepatoprotective effect of MSM against several toxins including acetaminophen, paraquat, and carbon tetrachloride. Animal models of experimental colitis and pulmonary hypertension indicate a protective effect as well.","Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Inflammatory disease of mucous membrane,[patf],14.64,C0333355|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Gastrointestinal Diseases,[dsyn],7.27,C0017178|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.23,C0682897|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Inflammatory disease of mucous membrane,[patf],14.64,C0333355|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Gastrointestinal Diseases,[dsyn],7.27,C0017178|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],26.25,C0029408|Term Birth,[orgf],19.20,C0233324|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Comprehension,[menp],12.88,C0162340|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Oxidative Stress,[comd],9.90,C0242606|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Inflammatory disease of mucous membrane,[patf],14.64,C0333355|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Gastrointestinal Diseases,[dsyn],7.27,C0017178|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Osteoarthritis, Knee,[dsyn],32.29,C0409959|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],14.64,C0029408|Comprehension,[menp],12.88,C0162340|Pain,[sosy],12.88,C0030193|Oxidative Stress,[comd],9.90,C0242606|Term Birth,[orgf],19.25,C0233324|Physical Examination,[hlca],9.73,C0031809|Pain,[sosy],14.64,C0030193|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],13.28,C0027627|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],12.89,C0029408|Eye,[bpoc],12.85,C0015392|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Edema,[sosy],9.90,C0013604|Symptom Assessment,[hlca],9.89,C3494437|Health Care,[hlca],9.73,C0086388|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Inflammatory disease of mucous membrane,[patf],14.64,C0333355|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Gastrointestinal Diseases,[dsyn],7.27,C0017178|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Oxidative Stress,[comd],30.21,C0242606|Colitis,[dsyn],16.05,C0009319|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],14.64,C0029408|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.89,C0027627|Comprehension,[menp],12.88,C0162340|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Pulmonary Hypertension,[patf],11.49,C0020542|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.74,C0026845|"
"('niacin', 'Medical uses')","Niacin and niacinamide are used for prevention and treatment of pellagra. 
 Niacin has sometimes been used in addition to other lipid-lowering medications.

"('niacin', 'Adverse effects')","The most common adverse effects of niacin at relatively low doses (50 500 mg) are flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching or tingling), headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, pruritus and rash. These can be minimized by initiating therapy at low dosages, increasing dosage gradually, and avoiding administration on an empty stomach.The acute adverse effects of high-dose niacin therapy (1 3 grams/day)   which is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemias   further include hypotension, fatigue, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, heartburn, blurred or impaired vision, and macular edema. With long-term use, the adverse effects of high-dose niacin therapy also include hepatic dysfunction (associated with fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite), hepatitis, and acute liver failure; these hepatotoxic effects of niacin occur more often when extended-release dosage forms are used. The long-term use of niacin at high doses (2 grams/day) also significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, diabetes, dyspepsia, and diarrhea.Flushing usually lasts for about 15 to 30 minutes, though it can sometimes last up to two hours. It is sometimes accompanied by a prickly or itching sensation, in particular, in areas covered by clothing. Flushing can be blocked by taking 300 mg of aspirin half an hour before taking niacin, by taking one tablet of ibuprofen per day or by co-administering the prostaglandin receptor antagonist laropiprant. Taking niacin with meals also helps reduce this side effect. Acquired tolerance will also help reduce flushing; after several weeks of a consistent dose, most patients no longer experience flushing. Reduction of flushing focuses on altering or blocking the prostaglandin-mediated pathway. Slow- or ""sustained""-release forms of niacin have been developed to lessen these side effects.Prostaglandin (PGD2) is the primary cause of the flushing reaction, with serotonin appearing to have a secondary role in this reaction. The effect is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal Langerhans cells and keratinocytes. Langerhans cells use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing, while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vasodilation. Flushing was often thought to involve histamine, but histamine has been shown not to be involved in the reaction.

The long-term use of niacin at high doses (2 grams/day) also significantly increases the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, diabetes, dyspepsia, and diarrhea.Hepatotoxicity is possibly related to metabolism via amidation resulting in NAD production. The time-release form has a lower therapeutic index for lowering serum lipids relative to this form of toxicity.

Increased prothrombin time and decreased platelet count have been reported; therefore, these should be monitored closely in patients who are also taking anticoagulants.Particularly the time-release variety, at extremely high doses, can cause acute toxic reactions. Extremely high doses of niacin can also cause niacin maculopathy, a thickening of the macula and retina, which leads to blurred vision and blindness. This maculopathy is reversible after niacin intake ceases.

"('niacin', 'Pharmacology')","Niacin and nicotinamide are both precursors of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in vivo. NAD converts to NADP by phosphorylation in the presence of the enzyme NAD+ kinase. NADP and NAD are coenzymes for many dehydrogenases, participating in many hydrogen transfer processes. NAD is important in catabolism of fat, carbohydrate, protein, and alcohol, as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, and NADP mostly in anabolism reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. High energy requirements (brain) or high turnover rate (gut, skin) organs are usually the most susceptible to their deficiency.The therapeutic effects of niacin are partly mediated through the activation of G protein-coupled receptors, including niacin receptor 1 (NIACR1) and niacin receptor 2 (NIACR2) which are highly expressed in adipose tissue, spleen, immune cells, and keratinocytes, but not in other expected organs such as liver, kidney, heart or intestine. NIACR1 and NIACR2 inhibit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and thus fat breakdown in adipose tissue and free fatty acids available for liver to produce triglycerides and  very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and consequently low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A decrease in free fatty acids also suppresses liver expression of apolipoprotein C3 and PPARg coactivator-1b, thus increasing VLDL turnover and reducing its production.The mechanism behind niacin increasing HDL is not totally understood, but seems to occur in various ways. Niacin increases apolipoprotein A1 levels due to anticatabolic effects resulting in higher reverse cholesterol transport. It also inhibits HDL hepatic uptake, down-regulating production of the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) gene. Finally, it stimulates the ABCA1 transporter in monocytes and macrophages and upregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, resulting in reverse cholesterol transport.Niacin reduces secondary outcomes associated with atherosclerosis, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), but increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Despite the importance of other cardiovascular risk factors, high HDL was associated with fewer cardiovascular events independent of LDL reduction. Other effects include anti-thrombotic and vascular inflammation, improving endothelial function, and plaque stability. As mediators produced from adipocytes, adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukins and chemokines, have pro-inflammatory effects, while others, such as adiponectin, have anti-inflammatory effects that influence the onset of atherosclerosis. Niacin also appears to upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression.Research has been able to show the function of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis; (2) influencing binding to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increasing apoB catabolism. HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways, such as by decreasing cholesterylester transfer protein activity and triglyceride levels, while increasing HDL cholesterol levels. 
  
 The liver can synthesize niacin from the essential amino acid tryptophan, requiring 60 mg of tryptophan to make 1 mg of niacin.  Riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron are required for the process.","Atherosclerosis,[dsyn],32.43,C0004153|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],30.97,C0018790|Liver,[bpoc],27.46,C0023884|Psychological Transfer,[menp],26.17,C0040671|Arteriosclerosis,[dsyn],26.08,C0003850|Intestines,[bpoc],23.12,C0021853|risk factors,[fndg],22.36,C0035648|Adipose tissue,[tisu],19.79,C0001527|Hypercholesterolemia,[dsyn],19.34,C0020443|Monocytes,[cell],19.20,C0026473|Spleen,[bpoc],17.80,C0037993|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Hypokinesia,[fndg],16.17,C0086439|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|macrophage,[cell],14.64,C0024432|Biological Transport,[celf],13.49,C0005528|Thrombus,[patf],13.14,C0087086|Dental Plaque,[dsyn],12.96,C0011389|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.96,C0027627|Brain,[bpoc],11.49,C0006104|DNA Repair,[genf],11.49,C0012899|Kidney,[bpoc],11.49,C0022646|Lipolysis,[orgf],11.49,C0023796|Signal Transduction,[celf],11.49,C0037083|keratinocyte,[cell],11.49,C0022567|Catabolism,[orgf],10.75,C0699900|Endothelium,[tisu],9.99,C0014257|Inflammation,[patf],9.99,C0021368|Adipocytes,[cell],9.90,C0206131|Phosphorylation,[moft],9.84,C0031715|Senile Plaques,[acab],9.81,C0333463|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.74,C0162429|Heart,[bpoc],8.34,C0018787|Lipid Metabolism,[moft],6.91,C0598783|Lanugo,[bpoc],6.76,C0423866|Blood Vessel,[bpoc],6.66,C0005847|Cells,[cell],3.68,C0007634|Therapeutic Effect,[clna],3.61,C1527144|Liver,[bpoc],8.34,C0023884|"

"('oats', 'Uses')","Oak wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm3 (0.43 oz/cu in) creating great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production.
Barrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak, with single barrel whiskey fetching a premium. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses, and other foods.

Japanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer Yamaha Drums. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch. In hill states of India, besides fuelwood and timber, the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements. The leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock.

The bark of the cork oak is used to produce wine stoppers (corks). This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco producing most of the world's supply.
Of the North American oaks, the northern red oak is one of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevents them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. Shumard oak, a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as ""mechanically superior"" to northern red oak. Cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber.
The standard for the lumber of the white oak group   all of which is marketed as white oak   is the Quercus alba. White oak is often used to make wine barrels. The wood of the deciduous pedunculate oak and sessile oak accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as Holm oak and cork oak also produce valuable timber.
The bark of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is also rich in tannin, and is used by tanners for tanning leather. Acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee.

"('olive', 'Uses')","The olive tree, Olea europaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, and the olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the ""trinity"" or ""triad"" of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and couscous, and the grape for wine.Table olives are classified by the IOC into three groups according to the degree of ripeness achieved before harvesting:
Green olives are picked when they have obtained full size, but before the ripening cycle has begun; they are usually shades of green to yellow.
Semi-ripe or turning-colour olives are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, when the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives.
Black olives or ripe olives are picked at full maturity when fully ripe. They are found in assorted shades of purple to brown to black. Most black olives are, in fact, not ripe olives, but are green olives that have been chemically treated to blacken them. 
 The olive tree, Olea europaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, and the olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the ""trinity"" or ""triad"" of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and couscous, and the grape for wine.Raw or fresh olives are naturally very bitter; to make them palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the throubes black olive, which when allowed to ripen in the sun, shrivel, fall from the tree and is then edible.The curing process may take from a few days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.The many types of preparations for table olives depend on local tastes and traditions. The most important commercial examples are listed below.
Spanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most commonly applied to green olive preparation, around 60% of all the world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2 4%) for 8 10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered ""treated"" when the lye has penetrated two-thirds of the way into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8 12% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or ""Terroir"" of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.
Sicilian or Greek type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe and ripe olives, they are almost identical to the Spanish type fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in fermentation vessels full of brine (8 12% NaCl). The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outdone by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.Picholine or directly-brined type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, they are soaked in lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10 72 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of the way into the fruit. They are then washed and immediately brined and acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbial stability. Fermentation still occurs carried out by acidogenic yeast and bacteria, but is more subdued than other methods. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds and a series of progressively stronger concentrations of salt are added until the product is fully stabilized and ready to be eaten.Water-cured type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, these are soaked in water or weak brine and this solution is changed on a daily basis for 10 14 days. The oleuropein is naturally dissolved and leached into the water and removed during a continual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a hammer or a stone to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations of 8 12% NaCl and acid corrected, and are then ready to eat.Salt-cured type (olives with minor fermentation): Applied only to ripe olives, they are usually produced in Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the olives are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentrations of salt draw the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.California or ""artificial ripening"" type (olives without fermentation): Applied to green and semiripe olives, they are placed in lye and soaked. Upon their removal, they are washed in water injected with compressed air. This process is repeated several times until both oxygen and lye have soaked through to the pit. The repeated, saturated exposure to air oxidises the skin and flesh of the fruit, turning it black in an artificial process that mimics natural ripening. Once fully oxidised or ""blackened"", they are brined and acid corrected and are then ready for eating. 
 The olive tree, Olea europaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, and the olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the ""trinity"" or ""triad"" of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and couscous, and the grape for wine.Olive wood is very hard and is prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature, and interesting grain patterns.  Because of the commercial importance of the fruit, and the slow growth and relatively small size of the tree, olive wood and its products are relatively expensive.  Common uses of the wood include: kitchen utensils, carved wooden bowls, cutting boards, fine furniture, and decorative items.
The yellow or light greenish-brown wood is often finely veined with a darker tint; being very hard and close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.

"('omega-6 fatty acids', 'Pharmacology')","The conversion of cell membrane arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) to omega-6 prostaglandin and omega-6 leukotriene eicosanoids during the inflammatory cascade provides many targets for pharmaceutical drugs to impede the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, vascular disease, thrombosis, immune-inflammatory processes, and tumor proliferation.

"('omega-6 fatty acids', 'Health effects')","Some medical research suggests that excessive levels of omega-6 fatty acids from seed oils relative to certain omega-3 fatty acids may increase the probability of a number of diseases. However, consumption of non-rancid nuts, which are high in omega 6, is associated with a lower risk for some diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, stroke, heart attacks, and lower rates of premature death.Modern Western diets typically have ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 in excess of 10, some as high as 30; the average ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 in the Western diet is 15 16.7. Humans are thought to have evolved with a diet of a 1-to-1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 and the optimal ratio is thought to be 4-to-1 or lower, although some sources suggest ratios as low as 1. A ratio of 2 3 omega-6 to omega-3 helped reduce inflammation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A ratio of 5-to-1 had a beneficial effect on patients with asthma but a ratio of 10-to-1 had a negative effect. A ratio of 2.5-to-1 reduced rectal cell proliferation in patients with colorectal cancer, whereas a ratio of 4-to-1 had no effect.Excess omega-6 fatty acids from vegetable oils interfere with the health benefits of omega-3 fats, in part because they compete for the same rate-limiting enzymes. A high proportion of omega-6 to omega-3 fat in the diet shifts the physiological state in the tissues toward the pathogenesis of many diseases: prothrombotic, proinflammatory and proconstrictive.Chronic excessive production of omega-6 eicosanoids is correlated with arthritis, inflammation, and cancer. Many of the medications used to treat and manage these conditions work by blocking the effects of the COX-2 enzyme. Many steps in formation and action of omega-6 prostaglandins from omega-6 arachidonic acid proceed more vigorously than the corresponding competitive steps in formation and action of omega-3 hormones from omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid. The COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor medications, used to treat inflammation and pain, work by preventing the COX enzymes from turning arachidonic acid into inflammatory compounds. (See Cyclooxygenase for more information.) The LOX inhibitor medications often used to treat asthma work by preventing the LOX enzyme from converting arachidonic acid into the leukotrienes. Many of the anti-mania medications used to treat bipolar disorder work by targeting the arachidonic acid cascade in the brain.A high consumption of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are found in most types of vegetable oil, may increase the likelihood that postmenopausal women will develop breast cancer. Similar effect was observed on prostate cancer, but the study was performed on mice. Another ""analysis suggested an inverse association between total polyunsaturated fatty acids and breast cancer risk, but individual polyunsaturated fatty acids behaved differently [from each other].

"('oregano', 'Uses')","Oregano is a culinary herb, used for the flavor of its leaves, which can be more flavorful when dried than fresh. It has an aromatic, warm, and slightly bitter taste, which can vary in intensity. Good-quality oregano may be strong enough almost to numb the tongue, but cultivars adapted to colder climates may have a lesser flavor. Factors such as climate, season, and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants. Among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are carvacrol, thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene.Oregano's most prominent modern use is as the staple herb of Italian cuisine. Its popularity in the U.S. began when soldiers returning from World War II brought back with them a taste for the ""pizza herb"", which had probably been eaten in southern Italy for centuries. There, it is most frequently used with roasted, fried, or grilled vegetables, meat, and fish. Oregano combines well with spicy foods popular in southern Italy. It is less commonly used in the north of the country, as marjoram generally is preferred.
The herb is widely used in cuisines of the Mediterranean Basin, the Philippines, and Latin America, especially in Argentine cuisine.
In Turkish cuisine, oregano is mostly used for flavoring meat, especially for mutton and lamb. In barbecue and kebab restaurants, it can be usually found as a condiment, together with paprika, salt, and pepper.
The dried and ground leaves are most often used in Greece to add flavor to Greek salad, and is usually added to the lemon-olive oil sauce that accompanies fish or meat grills and casseroles. 
 Oregano oil has been used in folk medicine over centuries. Oregano essential oil is extracted from the leaves of the oregano plant. Although oregano or its oil may be used as a dietary supplement, there is no clinical evidence to indicate that either has any effect on human health.In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned a Utah company, Young Living, that its herbal products, including oregano essential oil, were being promoted to have numerous unproven anti-disease effects, and so were being sold as unauthorized misbranded drugs subject to seizure and federal penalties. Similar FDA warning letters for false advertising and unproven health claims about oregano essential oil products were published in 2017 and 2018.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],79.81,C0682897|Taste Perception,[ortf],26.26,C0039336|World War II,[evnt],19.45,C0681710|Cold Climate,[npop],19.39,C0009267|Climate,[npop],16.05,C0008946|Tongue,[bpoc],14.64,C0040408|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Soil,[sbst],12.96,C0037592|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Desiccation,[npop],9.86,C0011682|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.79,C0162425|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Olivary Nucleus,[bpoc],25.63,C0228539|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Disease,[dsyn],9.77,C0012634|"
"('palm oil', 'Processing and use')","Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.After milling, various palm oil products are made using refining processes. First is fractionation, with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid (palm stearin), and liquid (olein) fractions. Then melting and degumming removes impurities. Then the oil is filtered and bleached. Physical refining removes smells and coloration to produce ""refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil"" (RBDPO) and free fatty acids, which are used in the manufacture of soaps, washing powder and other products. RBDPO is the basic palm oil product sold on the world's commodity markets. Many companies fractionate it further to produce palm oil for cooking oil, or process it into other products. 
 Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.Since the mid-1990s, red palm oil has been cold-pressed from the fruit of the oil palm and bottled for use as a cooking oil, in addition to other uses such as being blended into mayonnaise and vegetable oil.Oil produced from palm fruit is called red palm oil or just palm oil. It is around 50% saturated fat considerably less than palm kernel oil and 40% unsaturated fat and 10% polyunsaturated fat. In its unprocessed state, red palm oil has an intense deep red color because of its abundant carotene content. Like palm kernel oil, red palm oil contains around 50% medium chain fatty acids, but it also contains the following nutrients:
Carotenoids, such as alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lycopene
Sterols
Vitamin E 
 Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.White palm oil is the result of processing and refining. When refined, the palm oil loses its deep red color. It is extensively used in food manufacture and can be found in a variety of processed foods including peanut butter and chips. It is often labeled as palm shortening and is used as a replacement ingredient for hydrogenated fats in a variety of baked and fried products. 
 Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.The highly saturated nature of palm oil renders it solid at room temperature in temperate regions, making it a cheap substitute for butter or hydrogenated vegetable oils in uses where solid fat is desirable, such as the making of pastry dough and baked goods. The health concerns related to trans fats in hydrogenated vegetable oils may have contributed to the increasing use of palm oil in the food industry.Palm oil is also used in animal feed. In March 2017, a documentary made by Deutsche Welle revealed that palm oil is used to make milk substitutes to feed calves in dairies in the German alps. These milk substitutes contain 30% milk powder and the remainder of raw protein made from skimmed milk powder, whey powder, and vegetable fats, mostly coconut oil and palm oil. 
 Many processed foods either contain palm oil or various ingredients made from it.Palm oil is used to produce both methyl ester and hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel. Palm oil methyl ester is created through a process called transesterification. Palm oil biodiesel is often blended with other fuels to create palm oil biodiesel blends. Palm oil biodiesel meets the European EN 14214 standard for biodiesels. Hydrodeoxygenated biodiesel is produced by direct hydrogenolysis of the fat into alkanes and propane. The world's largest palm oil biodiesel plant is the  550 million Finnish-operated Neste Oil biodiesel plant in Singapore, which opened in 2011 with a capacity of 800,000 tons per year and produces hydrodeoxygenated NEXBTL biodiesel from palm oil imported from Malaysia and Indonesia.Significant amounts of palm oil exports to Europe are converted to biodiesel (as of early 2018: Indonesia: 40%, Malaysia 30%).. In 2014, almost half of all the palm oil in Europe was burnt as car and truck fuel.  As of 2018, one-half of Europe's palm oil imports were used for biodiesel.  Use of palm oil as biodiesel generates three times the carbon emissions as using fossil fuel, and, for example, ""biodiesel made from Indonesian palm oil makes the global carbon problem worse, not better.""The organic waste matter that is produced when processing oil palm, including oil palm shells and oil palm fruit bunches, can also be used to produce energy. This waste material can be converted into pellets that can be used as a biofuel. Additionally, palm oil that has been used to fry foods can be converted into methyl esters for biodiesel. The used cooking oil is chemically treated to create a biodiesel similar to petroleum diesel.

"('palm oil', 'Social and environmental impacts')","The palm oil industry has had both positive and negative impacts on workers, indigenous peoples and residents of palm oil-producing communities. Palm oil production provides employment opportunities, and has been shown to improve infrastructure, social services and reduce poverty. However, in some cases, oil palm plantations have developed lands without consultation or compensation of the indigenous people inhabiting the land, resulting in social conflict. The use of illegal immigrants in Malaysia has also raised concerns about working conditions within the palm oil industry.Some social initiatives use palm oil cultivation as part of poverty alleviation strategies. Examples include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's hybrid oil palm project in Western Kenya, which improves incomes and diets of local populations, and Malaysia's Federal Land Development Authority and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority, which both support rural development.The use of palm oil in the production of biodiesel has led to concerns that the need for fuel is being placed ahead of the need for food, leading to malnutrition in developing nations. This is known as the food versus fuel debate. According to a 2008 report published in the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, palm oil was determined to be a sustainable source of both food and biofuel. The production of palm oil biodiesel does not pose a threat to edible palm oil supplies. According to a 2009 study published in the Environmental Science and Policy journal, palm oil biodiesel might increase the demand for palm oil in the future, resulting in the expansion of palm oil production, and therefore an increased supply of food. 
 Palm oil cultivation has been criticized for impacts on the natural environment, including deforestation, loss of natural habitats, and greenhouse gas emissions which have threatened critically endangered species, such as the orangutan and Sumatran tiger.The NGO Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil promotes 'certified sustainable palm oil'. The Malaysian government seeks to allay concerns from environmental groups, which committed to preserve 50% of its total land area as forest.Environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth oppose the use of palm oil biofuels, claiming that the deforestation caused by oil palm plantations is more damaging for the climate than the benefits gained by switching to biofuel and using the palms as carbon sinks. While only 5% of the world's vegetable oil farmland is used for palm plantations, palm cultivation produces 38% of the world's total vegetable oil supply. In terms of oil yield, a palm plantation is 10 times more productive than soybean, sunflower or rapeseed cultivation because the palm fruit and kernel both provide usable oil. A 2018 study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) concluded that palm oil is ""here to stay"" due to its higher productivity compared with many other vegetable oils. The IUCN maintains that replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils would necessitate greater amounts of agricultural land, negatively affecting biodiversity. The IUCN advocates better practices in the palm oil industry, including the prevention of plantations from expanding into forested regions and creating a demand for certified and sustainable palm oil products.Palm oil is the most sustainable vegetable oil in terms of yield, requiring one-ninth of land used by other vegetable oil crops, but in the future laboratory-grown microbes might achieve higher yields per unit of land at comparable prices. 
 The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was created in 2004 to established international standards for sustainable palm oil production. Products containing Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO) can carry the RSPO trademark since 2008. Members of the RSPO include palm oil producers, environmental groups, and manufacturers who use palm oil in their products.After the meeting in 2009 a number of environmental organisations were critical of the scope of the agreements reached. Palm oil growers who produce CSPO have been critical of the organization because, though they have met RSPO standards and assumed the costs associated with certification, the market demand for certified palm oil remains low. Low market demand has been attributed to the higher cost of CSPO, leading palm oil buyers to purchase cheaper non-certified palm oil. Palm oil is mostly fungible. In 2011, 12% of palm oil produced was certified ""sustainable"", though only half of that had the RSPO label. Even with such a low proportion being certified, Greenpeace has argued that confectioners are avoiding responsibilities on sustainable palm oil, because it says that RSPO standards fall short of protecting the environment.","Consultation,[hlca],12.90,C0009818|Rural Development,[acty],11.49,C0035958|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.90,C0162429|Conflict (Psychology),[inbe],9.88,C0009671|Disease,[dsyn],9.72,C0012634|Forests,[npop],32.54,C0086312|Term Birth,[orgf],19.17,C0233324|Climate,[npop],16.18,C0008946|Carbon Sequestration,[phpr],12.91,C2936300|Affect (mental function),[menp],10.28,C0001721|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|"
"('palm oil', 'Nutrition and health')","Contributing significant calories as a source of fat, palm oil is a food staple in many cuisines. On average globally, humans consumed 7.7 kg (17 lb) of palm oil per person in 2015. Although the relationship of palm oil consumption to disease risk has been previously assessed, the quality of the clinical research specifically assessing palm oil effects has been generally poor. Consequently, research has focused on the deleterious effects of palm oil and palmitic acid consumption as sources of saturated fat content in edible oils, leading to conclusions that palm oil and saturated fats should be replaced with polyunsaturated fats in the diet.Excessive intake of palmitic acid, which makes up 44% of palm oil, increases blood levels of low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol, and so increases risk of cardiovascular diseases. Other reviews, the World Health Organization, and the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute have encouraged consumers to limit the consumption of palm oil, palmitic acid and foods high in saturated fat.","In Blood,[bdsu],32.47,C0005768|Blood,[bdsu],19.78,C0005767|Diet therapy,[hlca],11.49,C0012159|Consumption of goods,[acty],10.68,C0009830|Disease,[dsyn],9.81,C0012634|Lung,[bpoc],8.34,C0024109|Heart,[bpoc],6.83,C0018787|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],3.48,C0007222|"

"('papaya', 'Cultivation')","Papaya plants grow in three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female produces small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. The hermaphrodite can self-pollinate since its flowers contain both male stamens and female ovaries. Almost all commercial papaya orchards contain only hermaphrodites.Originally from southern Mexico (particularly Chiapas and Veracruz), Central America, and northern South America, the papaya is now cultivated in most tropical countries. In cultivation, it grows rapidly, fruiting within 3 years. It is, however, highly frost-sensitive, limiting its production to tropical climates. Temperatures below  2  C (29  F) are greatly harmful if not fatal. In Florida, California, and Texas, growth is generally limited to southern parts of the states. It prefers sandy, well-drained soil, as standing water will kill the plant within 24 hours.Papaya ringspot virus is a well-known virus within plants in Florida. The first signs of the virus are yellowing and vein-clearing of younger leaves, as well as mottling yellow leaves. Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and in time become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are a darker green than the fruit itself. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit's quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is the taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is genetic modification.The papaya mosaic virus destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves are left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as 2 weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings will increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has mottling of colors and mosaic does not.","Hermaphroditism,[dsyn],40.62,C0019269|Females,[orga],30.65,C0086287|Males,[orga],30.65,C0086582|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Growth,[orgf],20.26,C0018270|Negative Surgical Margin,[fndg],19.66,C1709157|Veins,[bpoc],19.59,C0042449|Tropical Climate,[npop],19.23,C0041183|Ovary,[bpoc],16.30,C0029939|Vision,[orgf],16.17,C0042789|Gender,[orga],16.15,C0079399|Bulla,[anab],14.64,C0005758|Taste Perception,[ortf],14.64,C0039336|Soil,[sbst],13.08,C0037592|Coitus,[orgf],13.00,C0009253|Darkness,[npop],12.84,C0010986|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Disease,[dsyn],9.88,C0012634|sex,[orga],9.85,C1522384|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|Virus Diseases,[dsyn],7.36,C0042769|"

"('pennyroyal', 'History')","Documented use of pennyroyal dates back to ancient Greek, Roman, and Medieval cultures. Its name   although of uncertain etymology   is associated with Latin pulex (flea), alluding to the manner it was used to drive away fleas when smeared on the body.  Pennyroyal was commonly incorporated as a cooking herb by the Greeks and Romans. A large number of the recipes in the Roman cookbook of Apicius called for the use of pennyroyal, often along with such herbs as lovage, oregano and coriander. Although it was commonly used for cooking also in the Middle Ages, it gradually fell out of use as a culinary herb and is seldom used as such today.Records from Greek and Roman physicians and scholars contain information pertaining to pennyroyal's medicinal properties, as well as recipes used to prepared it. Pliny the Elder, in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia  (Natural History), described the plant as an emmenagogue, and that it also expelled a dead fetus. Galen only listed pennyroyal as an emmenagogue, as did Oribasius. Roman and Greek writers Quintus Serenus Sammonicus and Aspasia the Physician however both agreed that pennyroyal, when served in tepid water, was an effective abortive method. A medical text on gynecology attributed to Cleopatra (though it was never written by her but by a female Greek physician Metrodora) recommends the use of pennyroyal with wine to induce abortions.In regard to its contraceptive properties, it was referred to in a joking manner in Aristophanes' play Peace (421 BCE). The god Hermes provides the male character Trygaios a female companion; when Trygaios asks if there would be a problem if she became pregnant, Hermes responds, ""Not if you add a dose of pennyroyal."" In a similar manner, in Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata, after a pregnant female character on stage is told to withhold her body sexually from her husband, a slender female character, in comparison to the pregnant woman, is described as ""a very lovely land Well croppy, and trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal.""Early settlers in colonial Virginia used dried pennyroyal to eradicate pests. Pennyroyal was such a popular herb that the Royal Society published an article on its use against rattlesnakes in the first volume of its Philosophical Transactions in 1665. 17th century apothecary and physician Nicholas Culpeper mentioned pennyroyal in his medical text The English Physitian, published in 1652. In addition to its abortive properties, Culpeper recommends its use for gastrointestinal ailments, such as constipation and hemorrhoids, as well as itching and blemishes to the skin, and even toothaches.Pennyroyal continued to be used up through the 20th and 21st centuries. Its oil is still commercially available today, though little is known about the appropriate dosages for humans. Scientists therefore likely consider it unsafe for use, as it is potentially toxic. 
 The following are reported cases in which pennyroyal toxicity resulted in death:

1897   A 23-year-old British woman died eight days after swallowing a tablespoon of pennyroyal in order to induce menstruation.
Circa 1909   The Supreme Court of Indiana convicted a Mr. Carter of prescribing and administering pennyroyal pills to a pregnant woman who died two months after her miscarriage.
August 1912   A 16-year-old girl from Maryland consumed 36 pennyroyal pills to induce abortion. An autopsy revealed that the herbal abortion was only partially successful.
November 1978   An 18-year-old pregnant woman from Denver, Colorado, died after ingesting one ounce of concentrated pennyroyal oil in an effort to abort her fetus. Prior to her death, the woman had reported using the dried leaves of the plant to induce menstruation with no ill effects.
July 1994   Kris Humphrey, a 24-year-old woman, died in California. At the time of her death, Humphrey unknowingly had an ectopic pregnancy, and drank a herbal tea made with pennyroyal extract. According to one news report, there is disagreement over whether Humphrey died as a result of the ectopic pregnancy or from pennyroyal poisoning.","Personality Character,[menp],30.10,C0007952|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Plague,[dsyn],19.75,C0032064|Females,[orga],19.71,C0086287|Toothache,[sosy],19.45,C0040460|Uncertainty,[fndg],19.34,C0087130|Hemorrhoids,[dsyn],17.80,C0019112|Gravidity,[fndg],16.12,C0600457|Constipation,[sosy],14.64,C0009806|Pruritus,[fndg],14.64,C0033774|Flea Infestation,[dsyn],13.14,C0277355|Intrinsic drive,[menp],11.49,C0013126|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.81,C0011065|Males,[orga],9.78,C0086582|Fetal Tissue,[tisu],6.83,C0242291|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Menstruation,[orgf],14.64,C0025344|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Deglutition,[orgf],9.75,C0011167|Miscarriage,[dsyn],19.20,C4552766|Spontaneous abortion,[patf],19.20,C0000786|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.13,C0011065|Menstruation,[orgf],13.02,C0025344|Fetal Tissue,[tisu],8.34,C0242291|Cessation of life,[orgf],29.93,C0011065|Ectopic Pregnancy,[patf],20.18,C0032987|Poisoning,[inpo],6.72,C0032343|"
"('pennyroyal', 'Uses')","Pennyroyal is frequently used as an insecticide and pest repellent.  As a pest repellent, it is used to keep fleas away from household animals as well as on humans to ward off gnats and mosquitos.  Some flea collars for pets have pennyroyal oil or the herb can be crushed in the lining.    Humans have also put crushed pennyroyal stems in their pockets or on their clothing to ward off unwanted insects.  However, when using the pennyroyal plant as a pest repellent, the use of the concentrated pennyroyal oil should be avoided. Pennyroyal oil can be extremely toxic to both humans and animals, even in small quantities. With the use of pennyroyal around animals and humans comes the risk of it being absorbed through the skin and causing negative health effects. The less concentrated leaves of the plant should be used instead as an insect repellent.
Pennyroyal has historically also been used as a mint flavoring in herbal teas and foods.  Pennyroyal tea has been used for cold relief, fevers, coughs, indigestion, liver and kidney problems and headaches. The fresh or dried leaves of pennyroyal have also been used when treating influenza, abdominal cramps, to induce sweating, as well as in the treatment of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis. To make the tea, the leaves of the plant are boiled in hot water.  The lower concentration of toxic chemicals in these teas are less harmful than pennyroyal oil.  It is recommended that people only drink pennyroyal tea periodically, as it is taxing on the body and should not be drunk on a regular basis.  Consumption of pennyroyal tea can be fatal to infants and children.The pennyroyal plant has also been used as an emmenagogue  or perhaps most famously as an abortifacient.  Chemicals in the pennyroyal plant cause the uterine lining to contract, causing a woman's uterine lining to shed.  Women who struggle with regulating their menstrual cycle or suffer from a cystic ovary syndrome may choose to drink pennyroyal tea.  Pennyroyal tea is subtle enough to induce menstrual flow with minimal risk of negative health effects.  More concentrated versions of the plant, such as the oil, are much more toxic and will likely force a miscarriage if ingested by a pregnant woman.  Since the U.S. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in October 1994 all manufactured forms of pennyroyal in the United States have carried a warning label against its use by pregnant women, but pennyroyal is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.At least one study has shown pennyroyal oil to have potent acaricidal activity against house dust mites.","Plague,[dsyn],58.65,C0032064|Crushing injury,[inpo],13.36,C0332679|Flea Infestation,[dsyn],13.02,C0277355|Uterus,[bpoc],26.05,C0042149|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.49,C0009264|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.49,C2350229|Miscarriage,[dsyn],20.95,C4552766|Spontaneous abortion,[patf],20.95,C0000786|Tuberculosis,[dsyn],20.95,C0041296|Ovarian Cysts,[dsyn],19.36,C0029927|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Sweating,[fndg],17.80,C0038990|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],14.64,C0424320|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Dyspepsia,[sosy],14.64,C0013395|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Smallpox,[dsyn],14.64,C0037354|Influenza,[dsyn],13.14,C0021400|Common Cold,[dsyn],13.03,C0009443|Menstruation,[orgf],13.02,C0025344|Alcoholic Intoxication,[mobd],13.02,C0001969|Mental Suffering,[mobd],13.01,C0683278|Syndrome,[dsyn],13.01,C0039082|Action Potentials,[celf],12.95,C0001272|Abdominal Cramps,[sosy],11.49,C0000729|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Educational Status,[fndg],11.49,C0013658|Menstrual cycle,[orgf],11.49,C0025329|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.88,C0041912|Disease,[dsyn],9.85,C0012634|Kidney,[bpoc],9.81,C0022646|Liver,[bpoc],8.34,C0023884|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|Mental concentration,[menp],3.55,C0086045|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|"
"('pennyroyal', 'Toxicity')","Pennyroyal is toxic to humans and has differing effects dependent on the volume and concentration ingested.  The most concentrated and toxic form of the pennyroyal plant is pennyroyal oil.  The oil contains 80% to 92% of cyclohexanone pulegone.  Pulegone, the molecule in highest concentration in the pennyroyal plant, causes a variety of ailments in those who ingest it and is what causes the plant to have its peppermint flavor.Symptoms that may persist after ingesting a small dose (<10 mL) of pennyroyal oil are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dizziness.  Larger volumes may result in multiorgan failure that could lead to death. There are no current toxicokinetics studies performed on humans for the effects of pulegone, but there are some studies performed on other mammals. When pulegone is ingested, it is broken down by the liver and reacts to form multiple toxic metabolites that can wreak havoc in the body.  Some identified metabolites are menthofuran, piperitenone, piperitone, and menthone.Study conducted on rats shows that pulegone can cause delayed action potential in cardiac muscles.
Study conducted shows pulegone damaged ovarian tissue in mice. Increased dosages correlated to more severe damage.
In a study, pulegone was given to female rats through oral administration in doses of 0, 75, or 150 mg/kg of body weight.  Individual studies lasted for 4 6 weeks and increased instance of urothelial tumors appeared as a result.In the first study listed above, pulegone reportedly had relaxant effects on vascular smooth muscles, myometrium, the bladder, intestine and the trachea of rats.  The relaxation effects on these organs can be attributed to pulegone blocking the ion channels for Ca2+ and K+ to enter and exit the cell, respectively.  This hinders the ability of the cell to achieve its necessary action potential for a nerve impulse to fire, relaxing the muscle.
In the second study listed, the impact of pulegone on follicular growth in mice was tested.  In the mice injected with pulegone, there was much lower follicular distribution per ovary than those not injected.  Ovarian follicles secrete hormones that influence a woman's menstruation cycle.  Estrogen levels are lower than normal when follicle numbers are low and it is possible that this can induce abortion or prevent ovulation.
In the third study, carcinomas in the bladder occurred at higher rates among mice that were injected with pulegone.  The mechanism of action that causes these effects involves cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.45,C0682897|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Multiple Organ Failure,[patf],13.10,C0026766|Action Potentials,[celf],13.05,C0001272|Myocardium,[tisu],12.91,C0027061|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Mental concentration,[menp],7.23,C0086045|Lanugo,[bpoc],6.66,C0423866|Liver,[bpoc],6.59,C0023884|Ovary,[bpoc],16.01,C0029939|Body tissue,[tisu],3.57,C0040300|Body Weight,[orga],22.38,C0005910|Relaxation,[acty],19.88,C0035028|myometrium,[bpoc],17.80,C0027088|Action Potentials,[celf],13.03,C0001272|Ability,[orga],13.02,C0085732|Muscle, Smooth, Vascular,[tisu],12.94,C0026844|Nerve Impulses,[celf],12.90,C1720744|Fire - disasters,[phpr],11.49,C0016141|Intestines,[bpoc],11.49,C0021853|Urinary Bladder,[bpoc],11.49,C0005682|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.08,C0018790|Females,[orga],9.88,C0086287|Urothelium,[tisu],9.70,C0227598|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],8.34,C0026845|Cells,[cell],7.23,C0007634|Trachea,[bpoc],6.72,C0040578|Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0027651|Ovarian Follicle,[bpoc],39.09,C0018120|Ovary,[bpoc],16.05,C0029939|Ovulation,[ortf],14.64,C0029965|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.91,C0027627|Menstrual cycle,[orgf],10.06,C0025329|Growth,[orgf],9.87,C0018270|Cell Proliferation,[celf],16.37,C0596290|Bladder Neoplasm,[neop],16.18,C0005695|Natural regeneration,[ortf],6.58,C0034963|Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder,[neop],3.57,C0005684|"
"('pennyroyal', 'Chemistry')","The active chemical in pennyroyal is pulegone.  Pulegone is a ketone and on the cellular level, ketones can act as enzyme inhibitors.  The carbonyl center of the pulegone structure acts as a strong electrophile, causing active sites on enzymes to bind with pulegone instead of the target protein.
The endocyclic double bond found in pulegone is vital to the activation and binding mechanism of the molecule and causes it to be an effective hepatotoxin.  When ingested, pulegone targets the liver and kidney, among other organs.  Studies have been conducted on rats show that one of the main effects is the inhibition of contractile activity in the myometrium and death by kidney failure.

"('reishi mushroom', 'Use')","Ganoderma lucidum produces a group of triterpenes called ganoderic acids, which have a molecular structure similar to that of steroid hormones. It also contains other compounds often found in fungal materials, including polysaccharides (such as beta-glucan), coumarin, mannitol, and alkaloids. Sterols isolated from the mushroom include ganoderol, ganoderenic acid, ganoderiol, ganodermanontriol, lucidadiol, and ganodermadiol.A 2015 Cochrane database review found insufficient evidence to justify the use of G. lucidum as a first-line cancer treatment. It suggests that G. lucidum may have ""benefit as an alternative adjunct to conventional treatment in consideration of its potential of enhancing tumour response and stimulating host immunity."" Existing studies do not support the use of G. lucidum for treatment of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
 Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) is added to boiling water which is then reduced to a simmer, covered, and left for 2 hours. The resulting liquid is dark and fairly bitter in taste. The red lingzhi is often more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated to increase the concentration. Alternatively, it can be used as an ingredient in a formula decoction, or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.Lingzhi is now commercially manufactured and sold. Since the early 1970s, most lingzhi is cultivated. Lingzhi can grow on substrates such as sawdust, grain, and wood logs. After formation of the fruiting body, lingzhi is most commonly harvested, dried, ground, and processed into tablets or capsules to be directly ingested or made into tea or soup. Other lingzhi products include processed fungal mycelia or spores.","risk factors,[fndg],22.36,C0035648|Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent,[dsyn],16.11,C0011860|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.47,C0006826|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],3.44,C0007222|Neoplasms,[neop],3.42,C0027651|Taste Perception,[ortf],26.14,C0039336|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.47,C2350229|Wood material,[sbst],12.96,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Mental concentration,[menp],5.18,C0086045|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|"

"('resveratrol', 'Pharmacology')","Resveratrol has been identified as a pan-assay interference compound, which produces positive results in many different laboratory assays. Its ability for varied interactions may be due to direct effects on cell membranes.As of 2015, many specific biological targets for resveratrol had been identified, including NQO2 (alone and in interaction with AKT1), GSTP1, estrogen receptor beta, CBR1, and integrin  V . It was unclear at that time if any or all of these were responsible for the observed effects in cells and model organisms.In vitro studies indicate resveratrol activates sirtuin 1, although this may be a downstream effect from its immediate biological target(s). It appears to signal through PGC-1 , thereby affecting mitochondria. In cells treated with resveratrol, an increase is observed in the action of MnSOD (SOD2) and in GPER activity.  In vitro, resveratrol was shown to act as an agonist of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor under pharmacological research as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. 
 One way of administering resveratrol in humans may be buccal delivery by direct absorption through the saliva.  However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is unlikely due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule.

"('riboflavin', 'Deficiency')","Riboflavin is continuously excreted in the urine of healthy individuals, making deficiency relatively common when dietary intake is insufficient. Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins.
A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary   poor vitamin sources in one's daily diet   or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine, the body not being able to use the vitamin, or an increase in the excretion of the vitamin from the body.
Subclinical deficiency has also been observed in women taking oral contraceptives, in the elderly, in people with eating disorders, chronic alcoholism and in diseases such as HIV, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. The Celiac Disease Foundation points out that a gluten-free diet may be low in riboflavin (and other nutrients) as enriched wheat flour and wheat foods (bread, pasta, cereals, etc.) is a major dietary contribution to total riboflavin intake.
Phototherapy to treat jaundice in infants can cause increased degradation of riboflavin, leading to deficiency if not monitored closely. 
 Treatment involves a diet which includes an adequate amount of riboflavin containing foods. Multi-vitamin and mineral dietary supplements often contain 100% of the Daily Value (1.3 mg) for riboflavin, and can be used by persons concerned about an inadequate diet. Over-the-counter dietary supplements are available in the United States with doses as high as 100 mg, but there is no evidence that these high doses have any additional benefit for healthy people.","Riboflavin Deficiency,[dsyn],24.11,C0035528|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.48,C0599638|Malnutrition,[dsyn],20.09,C0162429|Urine,[bdsu],9.86,C0042036|Riboflavin Deficiency,[dsyn],22.55,C0035528|Intestinal Absorption,[ortf],22.51,C0021826|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],14.64,C0027627|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.73,C0012159|Disease,[dsyn],9.73,C0012634|HIV Seropositivity,[lbtr],20.95,C0019699|Gluten-Free Diet,[hlca],17.80,C0344351|Celiac Disease,[dsyn],16.15,C0007570|Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic,[mobd],14.64,C0001973|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],14.64,C0011849|Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,[dsyn],14.64,C0021390|Chronic disease,[dsyn],13.24,C0008679|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.99,C0162429|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Heart Diseases,[dsyn],6.91,C0018799|Heart,[bpoc],6.79,C0018787|Eating Disorders,[mobd],6.62,C0013473|Paste substance,[sbst],3.87,C0030634|Neonatal Jaundice,[dsyn],16.29,C0022353|Patient Monitoring,[hlca],10.28,C0030695|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.90,C0162429|Catabolism,[orgf],3.57,C0699900|degradation aspects,[orgf],3.57,C0243125|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.71,C0006660|Diet therapy,[hlca],20.16,C0012159|Multiple Chronic Conditions,[dsyn],16.30,C3266262|"

The potential efficacy of probiotic AAD prevention is dependent on the probiotic strain(s) used and on the dosage. A 2015 Cochrane review recommended Lactobacillus rhamnosus or S. boulardii at 5 to 40 billion colony-forming units/day for the prevention of AAD in children, given the modest number needed to treat and the likelihood that adverse events are very rare. A recent meta-analysis of 21 randomised controlled trials (4780 participants) confirmed that S. boulardii is effective in reducing the risk of AAD in children and adults. 
 S. boulardii showed reduction of relapses in some specific patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and may be effective for secondary prevention of C. difficile infection. 
 S. boulardii has been shown to significantly increase the recovery rate of stage IV AIDS patients suffering from diarrhea versus placebo. On average, patients receiving S. boulardii gained weight, while the placebo group lost weight over the 18-month trial.  No adverse reactions were observed in these immunocompromised patients. 
 The addition of S. boulardii to the standard triple medication protocol for elimination of Helicobacter pylori infection showed a significant increase in eradication rates in a meta-analysis, though eradication rates were still not exceptional. The supplement also significantly decreased usual side effects of H. pylori eradication therapy including diarrhea and nausea. 
 Also, some evidence shows potential benefits of S. boulardii in treatment of blastocystosis.

"('senna', 'Death')","Senna died aged 34 after succumbing to fatal injuries sustained during his race at the San Marino Grand Prix, on 1 May 1994.The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the ""Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari"" circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April, and 1 May 1994. Senna stayed in room no. 200 at the Hotel Castello in Castel San Pietro Terme.The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title. Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling.
On Friday, Senna placed the car on the pole for a then-record 65th and final time, but he was upset by events unfolding that race weekend. Senna complained about the FW16's handling and reported that the car's performance was generally worse after the engineers' latest adjustments. During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and prot g  Rubens Barrichello was involved in a serious accident when his car became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.During Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie Roland Ratzenberger was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the 310 km/h (190 mph) Villeneuve corner, sending the car into the concrete retaining wall at high speed. Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor Sid Watkins, who suggested to a tearful Senna that he should retire from racing and take up fishing (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing. Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.Senna spent his final morning on the Sunday talking to former teammate and rival Alain Prost to discuss the re-establishment of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, a driver's union, with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season, and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.At the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned due to the speed allowing the Formula One cars' tires to cool, causing a consequential drop in tyre pressures. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, Max Angelelli, to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.
As Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307 km/h (191 mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around 233 km/h (145 mph), after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident.
Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. Initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss (around 4.5 liters). Because of Senna's poor neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.
At 18:40, the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning. Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.The right-front wheel and suspension are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. A piece of upright attached to the wheel had partially penetrated his helmet and made a large indentation in his forehead. In addition, it appeared that a jagged piece of the upright assembly had penetrated the helmet visor just above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal skull fractures, brain injuries and a ruptured temporal artery.As later revealed, when the medical staff examined Senna, a furled Austrian flag was found in his car a flag that he had intended to raise in honour of Ratzenberger after the race. Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and Autosprint's picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made public.On 27 April 2014, as part of commemorating Senna on the 20th anniversary of his death, a three-journalist panel composed of Murray Walker, Maurice Hamilton, and David Tremayne and interviewed by Sky Sports' Simon Lazenby, concurred that, at his final F1 Grand Prix race, Senna was under extreme pressure due to: 

the serious crash, during Friday practice, of his young compatriot, Rubens Barrichello, whom Senna had visited in hospital;
the death of F1 rookie Roland Ratzenberger during Saturday qualifying;
being 20 points behind in the Drivers' Championship;
suspicion of the rival Benetton B194 car using an illegal traction control system;
the poor performance of his Williams FW16;
family disapproval of his girlfriend, Adriane Galisteu. 
 Senna died aged 34 after succumbing to fatal injuries sustained during his race at the San Marino Grand Prix, on 1 May 1994.Senna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends.  The plane was escorted by fighter jets into S o Paulo Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where it was met by the Mayor of S o Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and the state's governor, Lu s Ant nio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.An estimated three million people flocked to the streets of Senna's hometown of S o Paulo to offer him their salute. This is widely accepted as the largest recorded gathering of mourners in modern times. Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in Ibirapuera Park.  After the public viewing, a 21-gun salute was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven Brazilian Air Force jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to Morumbi Cemetery.  Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, such as team managers Ken Tyrrell, Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart.  The pallbearers included drivers Gerhard Berger, Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost, Thierry Boutsen, Damon Hill, Rubens Barrichello, Roberto Moreno, Derek Warwick, Maur cio Gugelmin, Hans Stuck, Johnny Herbert, Pedro Lamy, Maurizio Sala, Raul Boesel, Emerson Fittipaldi, Wilson Fittipaldi, and Christian Fittipaldi. Neither Sid Watkins nor Jo Ram rez, the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow FOM president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and Senna's brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after his accident. FIA President Max Mosley instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger, which took place on 7 May 1994, in Salzburg, Austria. Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, ""I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his."" Senna's grave bears the epitaph ""Nada pode me separar do amor de Deus"", which means ""Nothing can separate me from the love of God"" (a reference to Romans 8:38 39).A testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where the McLaren cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby. This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for McLaren and that McLaren in the preceding seasons did not use Honda power. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near mythic status. For the next race at Monaco, the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger. 
 Senna died aged 34 after succumbing to fatal injuries sustained during his race at the San Marino Grand Prix, on 1 May 1994.Italian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with manslaughter. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case. This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on 13 April 2007, which stated: ""It has been determined that the accident was caused by a steering column failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on Patrick Head, culpable of omitted control"". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.The criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.","Leg,[bpoc],13.01,C1140621|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Lower Extremity,[bpoc],9.86,C0023216|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.68,C3263723|Accidents,[phpr],30.01,C0000924|Sudden infant death syndrome,[dsyn],16.16,C0038644|Speech,[orgf],16.04,C0037817|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Set (Psychology),[menp],14.64,C0036849|Retirement,[fndg],13.54,C0035345|Nose,[bpoc],13.14,C0028429|Conscious,[menp],12.89,C0234421|Mental association,[menp],12.88,C0004083|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.81,C0162867|Tears body substance,[bdsu],9.81,C0039409|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],9.74,C0033095|Laceration,[inpo],6.65,C0043246|Rupture,[inpo],6.65,C3203359|Individual Adjustment,[inbe],3.42,C0376209|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.96,C0027627|Accidents,[phpr],9.86,C0000924|Hospital Administration,[hlca],13.02,C0019948|Hemorrhage,[patf],10.06,C0019080|nervous system disorder,[dsyn],3.68,C0027765|intensive care,[hlca],3.49,C0085559|Cessation of life,[orgf],29.97,C0011065|Emergencies [Disease/Finding],[patf],25.97,C2745965|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Temporal Arteries,[bpoc],16.37,C0039482|Interview,[acty],16.14,C0021822|Brain Injuries,[inpo],14.64,C0270611|Brain Stem,[bpoc],14.64,C0006121|Skull Fractures,[inpo],13.22,C0037304|Anniversaries,[evnt],13.01,C0003097|Eye,[bpoc],12.88,C0015392|Brain,[bpoc],11.49,C0006104|Impacted tooth,[fndg],11.49,C0040456|Mydriasis,[sosy],9.99,C0026961|Pressure- physical agent,[phpr],9.88,C0033095|Rupture,[inpo],6.63,C3203359|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.86,C0011065|Air (substance),[sbst],49.09,C0001861|Cessation of life,[orgf],41.09,C0011065|Grief reaction,[menp],26.11,C0018235|Carrying,[acty],20.22,C0206243|Inspiration function,[orgf],16.21,C0004048|Sudden infant death syndrome,[dsyn],16.12,C0038644|Mourning,[menp],12.89,C0086644|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Accidents,[phpr],9.88,C0000924|Intrinsic drive,[menp],9.86,C0013126|Employment Termination,[fndg],9.86,C0014007|Love,[menp],9.86,C0024028|Fire - disasters,[phpr],9.73,C0016141|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.68,C3263723|CRANIOOSTEOARTHROPATHY,[dsyn],3.48,C2678439|Accidents,[phpr],52.27,C0000924|Fatal Outcome,[patf],22.49,C0206277|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.39,C0011065|Hand,[bpoc],13.02,C0018563|Accidental Falls,[inpo],12.89,C0000921|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],11.49,C0018790|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Satisfaction,[menp],11.49,C0242428|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.68,C3263723|"

"('slippery elm', 'Uses')","Ulmus rubra  has various traditional medicinal uses. The mucilaginous inner bark of the tree has long been used as a demulcent, and is still produced commercially for this purpose in the United States with approval for sale as an over-the-counter demulcent by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Sometimes leaves are dried and ground into a powder, then made into a tea. 
 The timber is not of much importance commercially, and is not found anywhere in great quantity. Macoun considered it more durable than that of the other elms, and better suited for railway ties, fence-posts, and rails, while Pinchot recommended planting it in the Mississippi valley, as it grows fast in youth, and could be utilized for fence-posts when quite young, since the sapwood, if thoroughly dried, is quite as durable as the heartwood. The wood is also used for the hubs of wagon wheels, as it is very shock resistant owing to the interlocking grain. The wood, as 'red elm', is sometimes used to make bows for archery. The yoke of the Liberty Bell, a symbol of the independence of the United States, was made from slippery elm. 
 Though now outmoded, slippery elm tablets were chewed by spitball pitchers to enhance the effectiveness of the saliva applied to make the pitched baseball curve. 
 The tree's fibrous inner bark produces a strong and durable fiber that can be spun into thread, twine, or rope useful for bowstrings, ropes, jewellery, clothing, snowshoe bindings, woven mats, and even some musical instruments. Once cured, the wood is also excellent for starting fires with the bow-drill method, as it grinds into a very fine flammable powder under friction.","Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Wood material,[sbst],29.46,C0043217|Fasting,[fndg],16.21,C0015663|Shock,[patf],11.49,C0036974|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Chewing,[orgf],16.18,C0024888|saliva,[bdsu],9.74,C0036087|Wood material,[sbst],14.64,C0043217|Friction,[npop],11.49,C0162691|Fibrosis,[patf],9.77,C0016059|Fire - disasters,[phpr],9.74,C0016141|"

Unlike oil of peppermint, oil of spearmint contains minimal amounts of menthol and menthone. It is used as a flavouring for toothpaste and confectionery, and is sometimes added to shampoos and soaps.Spearmint has been used traditionally as medicines for minor ailments such as fevers, and digestive disorders.

"('spearmint', 'Medical research')","The main chemical component of spearmint is the terpenoid carvone, which has been shown to aid in the inhibition of tumors. Perillyl alcohol, an additional terpenoid found in lower concentrations in spearmint, positively effects the regulation of various cell substances involved in cell growth and differentiation. 
 Studies on spearmint have shown varying results on the antioxidant effects of the plant and its extracts. Results have ranged from spearmint essential oil displaying considerable free radical scavenging activity to no antioxidant activity in spearmint essential oil, but strong activity in spearmint methanolic extract. Antioxidant activity has been shown to be significantly higher in spearmint that is dried at lower temperatures rather than high. It is suggested this is due to the degradation of phenolics at high temperatures. In experiments demonstrating antioxidant properties in spearmint oil, the major component, carvone, alone showed lower antioxidant activity. 
 Spearmint has been historically used for its antimicrobial activity, which is likely due to the high concentration of carvone. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been compared to, and is even said to surpass, that of amoxicillin, penicillin, and streptomycin. Spearmint oil is found to have higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria, which may be due to differing sensitivities to oils. The degree of antimicrobial activity varies with the type of microorganism tested. 
 Studies have found significant antiandrogen effects in spearmint, specifically following routine spearmint herbal tea ingestion. Antispasmodic effects have been displayed in spearmint oil and carvone, the main chemical component of spearmint.","Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.01,C0021467|Growth,[orgf],9.94,C0018270|Cell Differentiation process,[celf],8.34,C0007589|Cells,[cell],6.94,C0007634|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Neoplasms,[neop],3.55,C0027651|Fever,[sosy],13.44,C0015967|Desiccation,[npop],9.85,C0011682|Catabolism,[orgf],3.55,C0699900|degradation aspects,[orgf],3.55,C0243125|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.68,C0020517|Mental concentration,[menp],3.54,C0086045|"
"('stevia', 'History')","In the early 1970s, sweeteners such as cyclamate and saccharin were gradually decreased or removed from a variant formulation of Coca-Cola. Consequently, use of stevia as an alternative began in Japan, with the aqueous extract of the leaves yielding purified steviosides developed as sweeteners. The first commercial stevia sweetener in Japan was produced by the Japanese firm Morita Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. in 1971. The Japanese have been using stevia in food products and soft drinks, (including Coca-Cola), and for table use. In 2006, Japan consumed more stevia than any other country, with stevia accounting for 40% of the sweetener market.In the mid-1980s, stevia became popular in U.S. natural foods and health food industries, as a noncaloric natural sweetener for teas and weight-loss blends. The makers of the synthetic sweetener NutraSweet (at the time Monsanto) asked the FDA to require testing of the herb. 
As of 2006, China was the world's largest exporter of stevioside products. In 2007, the Coca-Cola Company announced plans to obtain approval for its stevia-derived sweetener, Rebiana, for use as a food additive within the United States by 2009, as well as plans to market Rebiana-sweetened products in 12 countries that allow stevia's use as a food additive. In May 2008, Coca-Cola and Cargill announced the availability of Truvia, a consumer brand stevia sweetener containing erythritol and Rebiana, which the FDA permitted as a food additive in December 2008. Coca-Cola announced intentions to release stevia-sweetened beverages in late December 2008. From 2013 onwards, Coca-Cola Life, containing stevia as a sweetener, was launched in various countries around the world.Shortly afterward, PepsiCo and Pure Circle announced PureVia, their brand of stevia-based sweetener, but withheld release of beverages sweetened with rebaudioside A until receipt of FDA confirmation. Since the FDA permitted Truvia and PureVia, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have introduced products that contain their new sweeteners.","Weight decreased,[fndg],22.46,C1262477|Long-Term Synaptic Depression,[ortf],14.64,C1136140|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],12.89,C0424320|Patient Discharge,[hlca],39.21,C0030685|Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy,[dsyn],29.46,C0270724|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.92,C0162425|"
"('stevia', 'Safety and regulations')","A 2011 review found that the use of stevia sweeteners as replacements for sugar might benefit people with diabetes, children, and those wishing to lower their intake of calories.Although both steviol and rebaudioside A have been found to be mutagenic in laboratory in vitro testing, these effects have not been demonstrated for the doses and routes of administration to which humans are exposed. Two 2010 review studies found no health concerns with stevia or its sweetening extracts.The WHO's Joint Experts Committee on Food Additives has approved, based on long-term studies, an acceptable daily intake of steviol glycoside of up to 4 mg/kg of body weight. In 2010, The European Food Safety Authority established an acceptable daily intake of 4 mg/kg/day of steviol, in the form of steviol glycosides. Meanwhile, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center warns that ""steviol at high dosages may have weak mutagenic activity,"" and a review ""conducted for"" the Center for Science in the Public Interest notes that there are no published carcinogenicity results for rebaudioside A (or stevioside).In August 2019, the US FDA placed an import alert on stevia leaves and crude extracts   which do not have GRAS status   and on foods or dietary supplements containing them due to concerns about safety and potential for toxicity.The plant may be grown legally in most countries, although some countries restrict its use as a sweetener. The legally allowed uses and maximum dosage of the extracts and derived products vary widely from country to country.

"('thiamine', 'Medical uses')","Thiamine is used to treat thiamine deficiency which when severe can prove fatal. In less severe cases, non-specific signs include malaise, weight loss, irritability and confusion. Well-known disorders caused by thiamine deficiency include beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, optic neuropathy, Leigh's disease, African Seasonal Ataxia, and central pontine myelinolysis.In Western countries, thiamine deficiency is seen mainly in chronic alcoholism. Thiamine deficiency is often present in alcohol misuse disorder. Also at risk are older adults, persons with HIV/AIDS or diabetes, and persons who have had bariatric surgery. Varying degrees of thiamine deficiency have been associated with the long-term use of high doses of diuretics, particularly furosemide in the treatment of heart failure. 
 Women who are pregnant or lactating require more thiamine. For pregnant and lactating women, the consequences of thiamine deficiency are the same as those of the general population but the risk is greater due to their temporarily increased need for this nutrient. In pregnancy, this is likely due to thiamine being preferentially sent to the fetus and placenta, especially during the third trimester. For lactating women, thiamine is delivered in breast milk even if it results in thiamine deficiency in the mother. Pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum are also at an increased risk for thiamine deficiency due to losses when vomiting.Thiamine is an important aspect for not only mitochondrial membrane development, but also synaptosomal membrane function. It has also been suggested that thiamine deficiency plays a role in the poor development of the infant brain that can lead to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Use of oral contraceptives and treatment with certain anticonvulsants, isoniazid, cycloserine, penicillamine, and hydrocortisone negatively impact vitamin B6 status.

"('vitamin b6', 'Toxicity')","Adverse effects have been documented from vitamin B6 supplements, but never from food sources. Damage to the dorsal root ganglia is documented in human cases of overdose of pyridoxine. Although it is a water-soluble vitamin and is excreted in the urine, doses of pyridoxine in excess of the dietary upper limit (UL) over long periods cause painful and ultimately irreversible neurological problems. The primary symptoms are pain and numbness of the extremities. In severe cases, motor neuropathy may occur with ""slowing of motor conduction velocities, prolonged F wave latencies, and prolonged sensory latencies in both lower extremities"", causing difficulty in walking. Sensory neuropathy typically develops at doses of pyridoxine in excess of 1,000 mg per day, but adverse effects can occur with much less, so doses over 200 mg are not considered safe. Symptoms among women taking lower doses have been reported.Existing authorizations and valuations vary considerably worldwide. As noted, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set an adult UL at 100 mg/day. The European Community Scientific Committee on Food defined intakes of 50 mg of vitamin B6 per day as harmful and established a UL of 25 mg/day. The nutrient reference values in Australia and New Zealand recommend an upper limit of 50 mg/day in adults. ""The same figure was set for pregnancy and lactation as there is no evidence of teratogenicity at this level. The UL was set based on metabolic body size and growth considerations for all other ages and life stages except infancy. It was not possible to set a UL for infants, so intake is recommended in the form of food, milk or formula."" The ULs were set using results of studies involving long-term oral administration of pyridoxine at doses of less than 1 g/day. ""A no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/day was identified from the studies of Bernstein & Lobitz (1988) and Del Tredici et al (1985). These studies involved subjects who had generally been on the supplements for five to six months or less. The study of Dalton and Dalton (1987), however, suggested the symptoms might take substantially longer than this to appear. In this latter retrospective survey, subjects who reported symptoms had been on supplements for 2.9 years, on average.

"('vitamin k', 'Medical uses')","Vitamin K is one of the treatments for bleeding events caused by overdose of the anticoagulant drug warfarin (Coumadin ). It can be administered by mouth, intravenously, or subcutaneously. Vitamin K is also used in situations when a patient's INR is greater than 10 and there is no active bleeding.Vitamin K is also part of the suggested treatment regime for poisoning by rodenticide (coumarin poisoning). Vitamin K treatment may only be necessary in people who deliberately have consumed large amounts of rodenticide or have consumed an unknown amount of rodenticide. Patients should be given oral Vitamin K1 to prevent the negative effects of rodenticide poisoning. Oral Vitamin K1 is preferred over other routes of administration because it has less side effects. 
 Vitamin K is given as an injection to newborns to prevent Vitamin K deficiency bleeding. The blood clotting factors of newborn babies are roughly 30 60% that of adult values; this may be due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. Human milk contains 1 4  g/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100  g/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in human milk appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25 1.7%, with a prevalence of 2 10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.
Bleeding in infants due to vitamin K deficiency can be severe, leading to hospitalization, blood transfusions, brain damage, and death. Supplementation can prevent most cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Intramuscular administration (known as the Vitamin K shot) is more effective in preventing late vitamin K deficiency bleeding than oral administration. 
 There is no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation benefits the bone health of postmenopausal women. 
 Adequate intake of vitamin K is associated with the inhibition of arterial calcification and stiffening, but there have been few interventional studies and no good evidence that vitamin K supplementation is of any benefit in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.One 10-year population study, the Rotterdam Study, did show a clear and significant inverse relationship between the highest intake levels of menaquinone (mainly MK-4 from eggs and meat, and MK-8 and MK-9 from cheese) and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in older men and women. 
 Vitamin K has been promoted in supplement form with claims it can slow tumor growth; however, no good medical evidence supports such claims.","Poisoning,[inpo],20.40,C0032343|Hemorrhage,[patf],19.88,C0019080|Drug Overdose,[inpo],16.21,C0029944|Milk, Human,[bdsu],39.00,C0026140|Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding,[dsyn],24.11,C2718087|Vitamin K Deficiency,[dsyn],19.27,C0042880|Birth,[orgf],16.25,C0005615|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.25,C0026131|Premature Birth,[patf],16.12,C0151526|Protein Biosynthesis,[moft],13.02,C0597295|Infertility,[patf],13.02,C0021359|Sterility, Reproductive,[patf],13.02,C4074771|Malnutrition,[dsyn],11.49,C0162429|Hemorrhage,[patf],9.74,C0019080|Intestines,[bpoc],9.72,C0021853|Mental concentration,[menp],3.55,C0086045|Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding,[dsyn],45.08,C2718087|Vitamin K Deficiency,[dsyn],20.95,C0042880|Brain Injuries,[inpo],14.64,C0270611|Hospitalization,[hlca],13.05,C0019993|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Hemorrhage,[patf],9.90,C0019080|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],3.43,C0262950|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.78,C0006660|Calcinosis,[patf],13.01,C0006663|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.01,C0021467|Negative Surgical Margin,[fndg],11.49,C1709157|Arteries,[bpoc],9.86,C0003842|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],7.23,C0007222|Growth,[orgf],9.94,C0018270|Neoplasms,[neop],3.63,C0027651|"
"('vitamin k', 'Side effects')","Although allergic reaction from supplementation is possible, no known toxicity is associated with high doses of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K, so no tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set. Specifically vitamin K1 has been associated with severe adverse reactions such as bronchospasm and cardiac arrest when given intravenously as opposed to orally.Blood clotting (coagulation) studies in humans using 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4) and even up to 135 mg per day (45 mg three times daily) of K2 (as MK-4), showed no increase in blood clot risk. Even doses in rats as high as 250 mg/kg, body weight did not alter the tendency for blood-clot formation to occur.Unlike the safe natural forms of vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 and their various isomers, a synthetic form of vitamin K, vitamin K3 (menadione), is demonstrably toxic at high levels.

"('vitamin k', 'Interactions')","Phylloquinone (K1) or menaquinone (K2) are capable of reversing the anticoagulant activity of the anticoagulant warfarin (tradename Coumadin). Warfarin works by blocking recycling of vitamin K, so that the body and tissues have lower levels of active vitamin K, and thus a deficiency of vitamin K.
Supplemental vitamin K (for which oral dosing is often more active than injectable dosing in human adults) reverses the vitamin K deficiency caused by warfarin, and therefore reduces the intended anticoagulant action of warfarin and related drugs. Sometimes small amounts of vitamin K are given orally to patients taking warfarin so that the action of the drug is more predictable.  The proper anticoagulant action of the drug is a function of vitamin K intake and drug dose, and due to differing absorption must be individualized for each patient. The action of warfarin and vitamin K both require two to five days after dosing to have maximum effect, and neither warfarin nor vitamin K shows much effect in the first 24 hours after they are given.The newer anticoagulants apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have different mechanisms of action that do not interact with vitamin K, and may be taken with supplemental vitamin K.","Vitamin K Deficiency,[dsyn],19.59,C0042880|Vitamin A Deficiency,[dsyn],19.52,C0042842|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],9.78,C0018790|Body tissue,[tisu],5.18,C0040300|Vitamin K Deficiency,[dsyn],20.95,C0042880|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.02,C2347023|"
"('whey protein', 'Major forms and uses')","Commercially produced whey protein from cow's milk typically comes in four major forms:

Concentrates (WPC) have typically a low (but still significant) level of fat and cholesterol but, in general, compared to the other forms of whey protein, they are higher in carbohydrates in the form of lactose   they are 29% 89% protein by weight.
Isolates (WPI) are processed to remove the fat and lactose   they are 90%+ protein by weight. Like whey protein concentrates, whey protein isolates are mild to slightly milky in taste.
Hydrolysates (WPH) are whey proteins that are predigested and partially hydrolyzed for the purpose of easier metabolizing, but their cost is generally higher. Highly hydrolysed whey may be less allergenic than other forms of whey.
Native whey protein is extracted from skim milk, not a byproduct of cheese production, and produced as a concentrate and isolate.There is evidence that whey protein is better absorbed than casein or soy protein.Whey protein is commonly marketed as a dietary supplement, typically sold in powdered form for mixing into beverages. The products have varying proportions of the major forms above, and are promoted with various health claims. In 2010 a panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined proposed health claims made for whey protein: satiety, weight loss, reduced body fat, increased muscle, increased strength, increased endurance and faster recovery after exercising. The EFSA concluded that the provided literature did not adequately support the proposed claims.Although whey proteins are responsible for some milk allergies, the major allergens in milk are the caseins.","Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.04,C0026131|Body Weight,[orga],22.36,C0005910|Body Weight,[orga],22.36,C0005910|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.11,C0026131|Taste Perception,[ortf],12.89,C0039336|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],32.41,C0026131|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Milk Allergy,[dsyn],16.08,C0079840|Fasting,[fndg],16.03,C0015663|Satiation,[menp],11.49,C0036239|Adipose tissue,[tisu],10.06,C0001527|Body Fat,[clna],10.06,C0344335|Fat Body,[bpoc],6.91,C0015665|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.83,C0026845|"
"('willow bark', 'Uses')","The leaves and bark of the willow tree have been mentioned in ancient texts from Assyria, Sumer and Egypt as a remedy for aches and fever, and in Ancient Greece the physician Hippocrates wrote about its medicinal properties in the fifth century BC. Native Americans across the Americas relied on it as a staple of their medical treatments. It provides temporary pain relief.
Salicin is metabolized into salicylic acid in the human body, and is a precursor of aspirin. In 1763, its medicinal properties were observed by the Reverend Edward Stone in England. He notified the Royal Society, which published his findings. The active extract of the bark, called salicin, was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the compound in its pure state.  In 1897, Felix Hoffmann created a synthetically altered version of salicin (in his case derived from the Spiraea plant), which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid. The new drug, formally acetylsalicylic acid, was named Aspirin by Hoffmann's employer Bayer AG. This gave rise to the hugely important class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
 Some of humans' earliest manufactured items may have been made from willow. A fishing net made from willow dates back to 8300 BC. Basic crafts, such as baskets, fish traps, wattle fences and wattle and daub house walls, were often woven from osiers or withies (rod-like willow shoots, often grown in coppices). One of the forms of Welsh coracle boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into wicker, which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow is less likely to split while being woven than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of boxes, brooms, cricket bats, cradle boards, chairmans and other furniture, dolls, flutes, poles, sweat lodges, toys, turnery, tool handles, veneer, wands and whistles. In addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope and string can be produced from the wood.  Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair. 
 Agriculture: Willows produce a modest amount of nectar from which bees can make honey, and are especially valued as a source of early pollen for bees. Poor people at one time often ate willow catkins that had been cooked to form a mash.
Art: Willow is used to make charcoal (for drawing) and in living sculptures. Living sculptures are created from live willow rods planted in the ground and woven into shapes such as domes and tunnels. Willow stems are used to weave baskets and three-dimensional sculptures, such as animals and figures.  Willow stems are also used to create garden features, such as decorative panels and obelisks.
Energy: Willow is grown for biomass or biofuel, in energy forestry systems, as a consequence of its high energy-in to energy-out ratio, large carbon mitigation potential and fast growth. Large-scale projects to support willow as an energy crop are already at commercial scale in Sweden. Programs in other countries are being developed through initiatives such as the Willow Biomass Project in the US, and the Energy Coppice Project in the UK. Willow may also be grown to produce charcoal.
Environment:  As a plant, willow is used for biofiltration, constructed wetlands, ecological wastewater treatment systems, hedges, land reclamation, landscaping, phytoremediation, streambank stabilisation (bioengineering), slope stabilisation, soil erosion control, shelterbelt and windbreak, soil building, soil reclamation, tree bog compost toilet, and wildlife habitat.
Religion: Willow is one of the ""Four Species"" used ritually during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles, cited in Leviticus 23:40. In Buddhism, a willow branch is one of the chief attributes of Kwan Yin, the bodhisattva of compassion. Christian churches in northwestern Europe and Ukraine and Bulgaria often used willow branches in place of palms in the ceremonies on Palm Sunday.","Ache,[sosy],14.64,C0234238|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Pain,[sosy],13.09,C0030193|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.32,C0007776|Digestion,[orgf],12.89,C0012238|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.86,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.86,C0022655|Calculi,[bdsu],9.86,C0006736|Structure of angular gyrus,[bpoc],3.43,C0152305|Rod Photoreceptors,[cell],45.19,C0206427|Wood material,[sbst],40.14,C0043217|Renal Osteodystrophy,[dsyn],25.54,C0035086|Wattles,[bpoc],13.71,C0043074|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.88,C0043240|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],9.85,C0011119|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],9.80,C0018790|Ataxia Telangiectasia,[dsyn],24.11,C0004135|Rod Photoreceptors,[cell],22.48,C0206427|Fasting,[fndg],16.12,C0015663|Growth,[orgf],9.99,C0018270|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.59,C0010352|Soil,[sbst],39.48,C0037592|Compost,[sbst],25.54,C1258026|Wetlands,[npop],16.30,C1721088|Bog,[npop],16.08,C1706414|Ecosystem,[npop],13.22,C0162358|Holidays,[acty],9.86,C0019843|"
"('yerba mate', 'Use as a beverage')","The infusion, called mate in Spanish-speaking countries or chimarr o in Brazil, is prepared by filling a container, typically a gourd, up to three-quarters full with dry leaves (and twigs) of the mate plant, and filling it up with water at a temperature of 70 80  C (158 176  F), hot but not boiling. Sugar may or may not be added; it may also be prepared with cold water (terer ).Drinking mate with friends from a hollow gourd (also called a guampa, porongo or mate in Spanish, caba a or cuia in Portuguese, or zucca in Italian) through a metal straw (a bombilla in Spanish, bomba in Portuguese), refilling and passing to the next person after finishing the few mouthfuls of beverage, is a common social practice in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and southern Brazil among people of all ages.
Although traditionally made from a hollowed calabash gourd, these days mate ""gourds"" are produced from a variety of materials including wood, glass, bull horns, ceramic and silicone.Yerba mate is most popular in Paraguay and Uruguay, where people are seen walking the streets carrying the mate and termo (thermal vacuum flask) in their arms. In Argentina 5 kg (11 lb) of yerba mate is consumed annually per capita; in Uruguay, the largest consumer, consumption is 10 kg (22 lb). The amount of the herb used to prepare the infusion is much greater than that used for tea and other beverages, accounting for the large weight used.

The flavor of brewed mate resembles an infusion of vegetables, herbs, grass and is reminiscent of some varieties of green tea. Some consider the flavor to be very agreeable, but it is generally bitter if steeped in boiling water. Flavored mate is also sold, in which the mate leaves are blended with other herbs (such as peppermint) or citrus rind.In Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina, a version of mate, known as mate cocido (Paraguay), ch  mate (Brazil) or just mate or ""cocido"" in Paraguay, is sold in teabags and in a loose leaf form.  It is often served sweetened in specialized shops or on the street, either hot or iced, pure or with fruit juice (especially lime   known in Brazil as lim o) or milk. In Paraguay, Argentina and southern Brazil, this is commonly consumed for breakfast or in a caf  for afternoon tea, often with a selection of sweet pastries (facturas).

An iced, sweetened version of mate cocido is sold as an uncarbonated soft drink, with or without fruit flavoring. In Brazil, this cold version of ch  mate is especially popular in the South and Southeast regions, and can easily be found in retail stores in the same cooler as soft-drinks. Mate batido, which is toasted, has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance. Mate batido becomes creamy when shaken. Mate batido is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil, as opposed to the far southern states, where it is consumed in the traditional way (green, consumed with a silver straw from a shared gourd), and called chimarr o (cimarr n in Spanish, particularly that of Argentina).In Paraguay, western Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul, west of S o Paulo and Paran ) and the Argentine littoral, a mate infusion, called terer  in Spanish and Portuguese or terer  in Portuguese in southern regions of Brazil, is also consumed as a cold or iced beverage, usually sucked out of a horn cup called guampa with a bombilla. Terer  can be prepared with cold water (the most common way in Paraguay and Brazil), or fruit juice (the most common way in Argentina). The version with water is more bitter; fruit juice acts as a sweetener (in Brazil, that is usually avoided with the addition of table sugar). Medicinal or culinary herbs, known as yuyos (weeds), may be crushed with a pestle and mortar, and added to the water for taste or medicinal reasons. Terer  is most popular in Paraguay, Brazil, and the Litoral (northeast Argentina).In the same way as people meet for tea or coffee, friends often gather and drink mate (matear) in Paraguay, Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay. Sharing mate is almost a ritual, following customary rules. In warm weather the hot water is sometimes replaced by lemonade, but not in Uruguay. Paraguay typically drinks yerba mate with cold water during hot days and hot water in the morning and cooler temperatures.

The gourd (mate in Spanish) is given by the brewer to each person, often in a circle, in turn; the recipient gives thanks, drinks the few mouthfuls and returns the mate to the brewer, who refills it and passes it to the next person in clockwise order.
Paraguayans have a tradition of mixing mate with crushed leaves, stems, and flowers of the plant known as flor de agosto (the flower of August, plants of the genus Senecio, particularly Senecio grisebachii), which contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Modifying mate in this fashion is potentially toxic, as these alkaloids can cause a rare condition of the liver, veno-occlusive disease, which produces liver failure due to progressive occlusion of the small venous channels in the liver.In the tiny hamlet of Groot Marico, North West Province, South Africa, mate was introduced to the local tourism office by the returning descendants of the Boers, who in 1902 had emigrated to Patagonia in Argentina after losing the Anglo Boer War.  It is also commonly consumed in Lebanon, Syria and some other parts of the Middle East mainly by Druze and Alawite population, following emigration to South America and return by many people, and worldwide by expatriates from the Southern Cone.Mate is consumed as a health food. Packages of yerba mate are available in health food stores and are frequently stocked in large supermarkets in Europe, Australia and the United States. By 2013, Asian interest in the drink had seen significant growth that led to significant exports to those countries.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.22,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],24.11,C2350229|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.49,C0009264|Drinking function,[orgf],16.05,C0684271|Body Temperature,[orga],16.04,C0005903|Common Cold,[dsyn],13.03,C0009443|Alcohol consumption,[inbe],12.90,C0001948|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.88,C0041912|Desiccation,[npop],9.73,C0011682|furuncle,[dsyn],3.63,C0242301|Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,[neop],24.11,C0206655|Body Weight,[orga],22.48,C0005910|Vacuum (physical force),[npop],19.25,C0042221|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],14.64,C2676739|Wood material,[sbst],14.64,C0043217|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Horns,[bpoc],6.83,C0019939|Consumption of goods,[acty],5.18,C0009830|flavor enhancers,[sbst],59.10,C0682897|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.61,C2350229|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],12.96,C0221023|Genetic Selection,[genf],6.70,C0036576|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|Drinking Water,[sbst],145.11,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],92.40,C0009264|Hot Temperature,[npop],68.56,C2350229|Common Cold,[dsyn],53.39,C0009443|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],40.39,C0041912|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.89,C0682897|Tremor,[sosy],16.59,C0040822|Weather,[npop],16.30,C0043085|Taste Perception,[ortf],14.64,C0039336|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],12.89,C0221023|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.72,C0332679|Horns,[bpoc],6.70,C0019939|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.56,C2987717|Emigration,[acty],22.49,C0013975|Retinal Cone,[cell],22.40,C0206428|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|War,[acty],16.25,C0043027|Liver Failure,[dsyn],13.02,C0085605|Growth,[orgf],9.99,C0018270|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Hepatic Insufficiency,[patf],9.86,C1306571|Dental Occlusion,[ortf],9.73,C0011382|Veins,[bpoc],9.73,C0042449|Liver,[bpoc],8.34,C0023884|Liver diseases,[dsyn],6.74,C0023895|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.66,C0332679|"
"('yerba mate', 'Health effects')","Yerba mate has been claimed to have various effects on human health and these effects have been attributed to the high quantity of polyphenols found in mate tea. Research has found that yerba mate may improve allergy symptoms and reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus and high blood sugar in mice.Mate also contains compounds that act as an appetite suppressant and possible weight loss tool, increases mental energy and focus, improves mood, and promotes deeper sleep; however, sleep may be negatively affected in people who are sensitive to caffeine.Before 2011, there were no double-blind, randomized prospective clinical trials of yerba mate consumption with respect to chronic disease. However, many studies have been conducted since then, pointing to at least some probable benefits from some claims, such as reduction of fat cells, inflammation and cholesterol, although more research is needed. Some non-blinded studies have found mate consumption to be effective in lipid lowering. Another study determined that mate reduces progression of arteriosclerosis in rabbits but did not decrease serum cholesterol or aortic TBARS and antioxidant enzymes.The consumption of hot mate tea is associated with oral cancer, esophageal cancer, cancer of the larynx, and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. Studies show a correlation between tea temperature and likelihood of cancer, making it unclear how much of a role mate itself plays as a carcinogen.

Yerba mate has been shown to increase satiety by slowing gastric emptying. Effects on weight loss may be due to reduced absorption of dietary fats and/or altered cholesterol metabolism.Despite yerba mate's potential for reducing body weight, there is minimal data on the effects of yerba mate on body weight in humans. Therefore, yerba mate should not be recommended over diet and physical exercise without further study on its effects.","Weight decreased,[fndg],22.43,C1262477|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.35,C2350229|Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,[neop],19.91,C1168401|Blindness,[fndg],19.22,C0456909|Esophageal Neoplasms,[neop],17.80,C0014859|Respiratory Diaphragm,[bpoc],16.05,C0011980|Body Temperature,[orga],16.05,C0005903|Chronic disease,[dsyn],14.64,C0008679|Hypersensitivity,[patf],13.47,C0020517|Hyperglycemia,[dsyn],13.14,C0020456|Serum,[bdsu],13.14,C0229671|Disease Progression,[patf],13.05,C0242656|Aorta,[bpoc],12.96,C0003483|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],12.92,C0011849|Arteriosclerosis,[dsyn],12.91,C0003850|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Sleep,[orgf],11.49,C0037313|Consumption of goods,[acty],10.90,C0009830|Affect (mental function),[menp],9.86,C0001721|Adipocytes,[cell],9.76,C0206131|Allergic Reaction,[patf],6.66,C1527304|Malignant neoplasm of esophagus,[neop],5.18,C0546837|Malignant neoplasm of larynx,[neop],5.18,C0007107|Mood (psychological function),[menp],5.18,C0026516|Malignant neoplasm of mouth,[neop],3.64,C0153381|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.45,C0006826|Body Weight,[orga],45.15,C0005910|Weight decreased,[fndg],45.09,C1262477|Blindness,[fndg],19.22,C0456909|Respiratory Diaphragm,[bpoc],16.05,C0011980|Chronic disease,[dsyn],14.64,C0008679|Hypersensitivity,[patf],13.47,C0020517|Hyperglycemia,[dsyn],13.14,C0020456|Serum,[bdsu],13.14,C0229671|Disease Progression,[patf],13.05,C0242656|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.01,C2347023|Aorta,[bpoc],12.96,C0003483|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],12.92,C0011849|Gastric Emptying,[ortf],12.92,C0017127|Arteriosclerosis,[dsyn],12.91,C0003850|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Sleep,[orgf],11.49,C0037313|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.90,C0012159|Satiation,[menp],9.87,C0036239|Affect (mental function),[menp],9.86,C0001721|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],9.81,C0018790|Adipocytes,[cell],9.76,C0206131|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.22,C0009830|Pancreas,[bpoc],6.83,C0030274|Allergic Reaction,[patf],6.66,C1527304|Lipid Metabolism,[moft],6.62,C0598783|Mood (psychological function),[menp],5.18,C0026516|Metabolism,[orgf],3.63,C0025519|"
"('zinc', 'Compounds and chemistry')","Zinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d104s2 and is a member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide. This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.
Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed, the outer shell s electrons are lost, yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H2O)6]2+ is the predominant species. The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285  C indicates the formation of Zn2Cl2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist.Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.","Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Air (substance),[sbst],16.05,C0001861|Bone structure of radius,[bpoc],38.84,C0034627|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Body Temperature,[orga],16.18,C0005903|Air (substance),[sbst],16.16,C0001861|Volatilization,[npop],9.88,C0042945|Burn injury,[inpo],8.34,C0006434|Solutions,[sbst],6.83,C0037633|"
"('zinc', 'History')","Various isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. Zinc ores were used to make the zinc copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries BC contains 23% zinc.Knowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient Greece by the 7th century BC, but few varieties were made. Ornaments made of alloys containing 80 90% zinc, with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making up the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years old. A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site.The oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship Relitto del Pozzino, wrecked in 140 BC.The manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30 BC. They made brass by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass.Strabo writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theopompus) mentions ""drops of false silver"" which when mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by-product of smelting sulfide ores. Zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless.The Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc.The Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces pushpanjan, thought to be zinc oxide. Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since the Mauryan period (c.  322 and 187 BCE). The smelting of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes.","Alzheimer disease, familial, type 3,[dsyn],39.86,C1843013|Thinking, function,[menp],35.02,C0039869|Chromosome Deletion,[comd],22.47,C0008628|Eye,[bpoc],13.03,C0015392|Dental Plaque,[dsyn],12.89,C0011389|Senile Plaques,[acab],9.73,C0333463|"
"('zinc', 'Production')","Refinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombi res between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1.Zinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20 ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50 ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2 ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.

Soils contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000 ppm to 180,000 ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.","Rivers,[npop],32.42,C0337050|In Blood,[bdsu],16.18,C0005768|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Blood,[bdsu],9.88,C0005767|Carrying,[acty],9.88,C0206243|Mental concentration,[menp],7.53,C0086045|Soil,[sbst],54.04,C0037592|Ability,[orga],13.01,C0085732|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|"

Galvanizing (55%)
Brass and bronze (16%)
Other alloys (21%)
Miscellaneous (8%)Zinc is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893,000 tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.
With a standard electrode potential (SEP) of  0.76 volts, zinc is used as an anode material for batteries. (More reactive lithium (SEP  3.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way in alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of zinc carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc-air battery/fuel cell. The zinc-cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell.

Galvanizing (55%)
Brass and bronze (16%)
Other alloys (21%)
Miscellaneous (8%)A widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.

Other widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85 88% zinc, 4 10% copper, and 2 8% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc is the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982. The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, 33,200 tonnes (36,600 short tons) of zinc were used to produce 13.6 billion pennies in the United States.Alloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.Similar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.As a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns, zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels.Cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.

Miscellaneous (8%)Roughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disperse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.Zinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (Zn(CH3)2) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.Zinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.Zinc sheet metal is used to make zinc bars.64Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation. Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.65Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms.Zinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides; these include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. Zinc in the form of ZDDP, is used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.

Miscellaneous (8%)Organozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon-zinc bonds, describing the physical properties, synthesis, and chemical reactions.Many organozinc compounds are important. Among important applications are

The Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester (ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to form the  -hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR
The Reformatskii reaction in which  -halo-esters and aldehydes are converted to  -hydroxy-esters
The Simmons Smith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane
The Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to form carbonyl compounds
The Barbier reaction (1899), which is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is the better of the two. In presence of water, formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can take place in water.
On the downside, organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, and they are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study, the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors
The Negishi coupling is also an important reaction for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium. A key step in the catalytic cycle is a transmetalation in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel) metal center.
The Fukuyama coupling is another coupling reaction, but it uses a thioester as reactant and produces a ketone.Zinc has found many applications as a catalyst in organic synthesis including asymmetric synthesis, being cheap and easily available alternative to precious metal complexes. The results (yield and enantiomeric excess) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts are comparable to those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others, and zinc becomes a metal catalyst of choice.

Miscellaneous (8%)In most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and mineral supplements, zinc is included in such forms as zinc oxide, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate. Zinc is generally considered to be an antioxidant. However, it is redox inert and thus can serve such a function only indirectly. Generally, zinc supplement is recommended where there is high risk of zinc deficiency (such as low and middle income countries) as a preventive measure.Zinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment.Zinc serves as a simple, inexpensive, and critical tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months.A Cochrane review stated that people taking zinc supplement may be less likely to progress to age-related macular degeneration.Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants.Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.In 2011, researchers reported that adding large amounts of zinc to a urine sample masked detection of drugs. The researchers did not test whether orally consuming a zinc dietary supplement could have the same effect.Zinc is a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.Zinc supplements (frequently zinc acetate or zinc gluconate lozenges) are a group of dietary supplements that are commonly used for the treatment of the common cold. The use of zinc supplements at doses in excess of 75 mg/day within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms has been shown to reduce the duration of cold symptoms by about 1 day. Due to a lack of data, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the preventative use of zinc supplements reduces the likelihood of contracting a cold. Adverse effects with zinc supplements by mouth include bad taste and nausea. The intranasal use of zinc-containing nasal sprays has been associated with the loss of the sense of smell; consequently, in June 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) warned consumers to stop using intranasal zinc products.The human rhinovirus   the most common viral pathogen in humans   is the predominant cause of the common cold. The hypothesized mechanism of action by which zinc reduces the severity and/or duration of cold symptoms is the suppression of nasal inflammation and the direct inhibition of rhinoviral receptor binding and rhinoviral replication in the nasal mucosa. 
 Major applications of zinc include (numbers are given for the US)
Galvanizing (55%)
Brass and bronze (16%)
Other alloys (21%)
Miscellaneous (8%)Topical preparations of zinc include those used on the skin, often in the form of zinc oxide. Zinc preparations can protect against sunburn in the summer and windburn in the winter. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.Chelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent bad breath.Zinc pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff.","Hot Temperature,[npop],22.43,C2350229|Seawater,[sbst],16.26,C0036499|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Electricity,[npop],13.05,C0013790|Corrosion,[npop],6.71,C0010106|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.68,C0018837|Air (substance),[sbst],16.04,C0001861|Oxidation-Reduction,[moft],9.77,C0030012|Cells,[cell],6.99,C0007634|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.43,C0599638|Corrosion,[npop],6.63,C0010106|Cold Temperature,[npop],45.97,C0009264|Expiration, function,[orgf],33.17,C0231800|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.48,C0011065|Photons,[sbst],19.19,C0086805|Dental Cementum,[bdsu],17.80,C0011343|Plastics,[sbst],17.80,C0032167|Melting,[npop],16.15,C0599882|Gamma Rays,[npop],16.06,C0017011|Fasting,[fndg],16.05,C0015663|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Electricity,[npop],13.02,C0013790|Wakefulness,[menp],12.93,C0043012|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],11.49,C0011119|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0041912|Esthesia,[ortf],9.82,C0036658|Radiation,[npop],6.59,C0851346|Viscosity,[npop],6.57,C0042784|Ultraviolet Rays,[npop],45.39,C0041625|Pigmentation,[orga],39.98,C0031911|Wood material,[sbst],26.20,C0043217|Neutrons,[sbst],26.04,C0027946|UV Radiation,[npop],22.41,C4319812|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.35,C2350229|Intention - mental process,[menp],19.60,C0162425|luminescence,[npop],19.28,C1450275|Light,[npop],17.80,C0023693|Roentgen Rays,[npop],17.80,C0043309|Gamma Rays,[npop],16.37,C0017011|Plastics,[sbst],16.18,C0032167|Hand,[bpoc],13.01,C0018563|Violence,[mobd],12.89,C0042693|Heat (physical force),[npop],7.70,C0018837|Radioactivity,[npop],6.71,C0034553|Corrosion,[npop],6.63,C0010106|Physical Phenomenon or Property,[npop],5.18,C0597237|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.00,C0599638|Catalysis,[npop],6.66,C0007382|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.05,C0008300|Cold Temperature,[npop],68.44,C0009264|Common Cold,[dsyn],68.19,C0009443|Diarrhea,[sosy],39.48,C0011991|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],29.99,C0041912|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.74,C0006660|Biological Absorption,[orgf],26.23,C2347023|Unmarried,[fndg],22.43,C0087136|Malnutrition,[dsyn],19.79,C0162429|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.33,C0030685|Olfactory Mucosa,[tisu],19.22,C0028937|granulocyte,[cell],17.80,C0018183|Anosmia,[fndg],16.28,C0003126|Structure of mucous membrane of nose,[tisu],16.07,C0027428|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Age related macular degeneration,[dsyn],13.18,C0242383|Major Depressive Disorder,[mobd],13.14,C1269683|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.01,C0021467|Acrodermatitis enteropathica,[dsyn],12.91,C0221036|Nose,[bpoc],12.89,C0028429|Gastroenteritis,[dsyn],11.49,C0017160|Oxidation-Reduction,[moft],11.49,C0030012|Unipolar Depression,[mobd],9.99,C0041696|DNA Replication,[genf],9.86,C0598312|Inflammation,[patf],9.74,C0021368|Urine,[bdsu],9.73,C0042036|Hereditary Diseases,[dsyn],6.64,C0019247|Pathogenicity,[orga],6.62,C1136169|Cells,[cell],3.43,C0007634|Diaper Rash,[dsyn],19.41,C0011974|Halitosis,[sosy],14.64,C0018520|Seborrheic dermatitis of scalp,[dsyn],14.64,C0221244|Sunburn,[inpo],13.05,C0038814|"
"('zinc', 'Precautions')","Although zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.The free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.Evidence shows that people taking 100 300 mg of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency. A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80 mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. Levels of 100 300 mg may interfere with the utilization of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Zinc in excess of 500 ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. A condition called the zinc shakes or ""zinc chills"" can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials. Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38 mg of zinc per gram. Disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.Recent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes. 
 In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1 kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12 grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.","Anosmia,[fndg],49.59,C0003126|Biological Absorption,[orgf],39.78,C2347023|Stomach,[bpoc],26.13,C0038351|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.35,C0009264|Poliomyelitis,[dsyn],16.63,C0032371|Tremor,[sosy],16.30,C0040822|Inspiration function,[orgf],16.17,C0004048|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Soil,[sbst],14.64,C0037592|Gastric Acid,[bdsu],13.48,C0017119|Sensory Receptor Cells,[celc],13.01,C0034837|Smell Perception,[orgf],12.90,C0037361|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.89,C0009443|Nose,[bpoc],12.88,C0028429|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Chills,[sosy],11.49,C0085593|Deglutition,[orgf],11.49,C0011167|Disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0012634|melanocyte,[cell],11.49,C0025201|Malnutrition,[dsyn],9.94,C0162429|keratinocyte,[cell],9.94,C0022567|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.85,C0011065|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.73,C0041912|Solutions,[sbst],6.83,C0037633|Urinary tract,[bpoc],6.71,C0042027|Cerebellar Ataxia,[dsyn],20.95,C0007758|Cerebellar Dysmetria,[fndg],19.48,C0234162|Ataxia,[sosy],17.80,C0004134|Lethargy,[sosy],16.30,C0023380|Sepsis,[dsyn],16.30,C0243026|Septicemia,[dsyn],16.30,C0036690|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Poisoning,[inpo],13.81,C0032343|Anemia, Hemolytic,[dsyn],13.22,C0002878|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.02,C1096155|Kidney,[bpoc],9.99,C0022646|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Liver,[bpoc],8.34,C0023884|Foreign Bodies,[inpo],6.60,C0016542|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.58,C0026845|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.56,C0009830|"
"('5-htp', 'Uses')","5-HTP is sold over the counter in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant, and sleep aid. It is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under the trade names Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum.A 2002 review concluded that although the data evaluated suggests that 5-HTP is more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression, the evidence was insufficient to be conclusive due to a lack of clinical data meeting the rigorous standards of today. More and larger studies using current methodologies are needed to determine if 5-HTP is truly effective in treating depression. In small controlled trials 5-HTP has also been reported to augment the antidepressant efficacy of the antidepressant clomipramine.5-HTP is sometimes taken by people coming down from MDMA to relieve post-MDMA dysphoria. As 5-HTP is a necessary precursor for the brain to produce more serotonin, and MDMA use depletes a person's natural serotonin levels, it is believed that taking 5-HTP after consuming MDMA will speed up serotonin production. DanceSafe claims that the anecdotal evidence is widespread and that the theory is physiologically reasonable. Backing up this approach is research conducted by Wang, et al. in 2007, which observed that MDMA-induced depletions of 5-HT (serotonin) were restored in rats after administration of 5-HTP, and suggested that this approach might be clinically useful in abstinent MDMA users.At high doses, or in combination with carbidopa, it has been used off-label to treat obesity (by promoting weight loss).In clinical trials of various design, 5-HTP has also been reported to treat fibromyalgia, myoclonus, migraine, and cerebellar ataxia. However, these clinical findings, as for all therapeutic findings with 5-HTP, are preliminary and need confirmation in larger trials.","Obesity,[dsyn],30.42,C0028754|Mental Depression,[mobd],25.94,C0011570|Weight decreased,[fndg],22.68,C1262477|Cerebellar Ataxia,[dsyn],20.95,C0007758|Migraine Disorders,[dsyn],20.95,C0149931|Depressive disorder,[mobd],19.59,C0011581|Thrombocythemia, Essential,[dsyn],19.27,C0040028|Muscle Rigidity,[sosy],19.16,C0026837|Myoclonus,[sosy],17.80,C0027066|Hashimoto Disease,[dsyn],16.04,C0677607|Fibromyalgia,[dsyn],14.64,C0016053|Major Depressive Disorder,[mobd],12.91,C1269683|Sleep,[orgf],9.81,C0037313|Unipolar Depression,[mobd],9.76,C0041696|Brain,[bpoc],9.74,C0006104|Signs and Symptoms,[sosy],8.34,C0037088|"
"('5-htp', 'Side effects')","Potential side effects of 5-HTP include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, vivid dreams or nightmares, and muscle problems. Because 5-HTP has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, possible side effects and interactions with other drugs are not well known. According to the US National Institute of Health TOXNET, 5-HTP has not been associated with serotonin syndrome or any serious adverse events in humans. Across multiple studies, 5-HTP has also been reported to not cause any noticeable hematological or cardiovascular changes. 5-HTP has also been associated with eosinophilia, but later studies have not found any causal connection.","Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome,[dsyn],22.57,C0024586|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Nightmares,[sosy],17.80,C0028084|Dreams,[menp],16.30,C0013117|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Heartburn,[sosy],14.64,C0018834|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Drug Interactions,[patf],13.06,C0687133|Eosinophilia,[dsyn],13.05,C0014457|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Serotonin Syndrome,[inpo],9.95,C0699828|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.66,C0026845|"
"('5-htp', 'Interactions')","When combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class, very high parenteral doses of 5-HTP can cause acute serotonin syndrome in rats. It is unclear if such findings have clinical relevance, as most drugs will cause serious adverse events or death in rodents at very high doses. In humans 5-HTP has never been clinically associated with serotonin syndrome, although a case report suggests 5-HTP can precipitate mania when added to an MAOI.When combined with carbidopa (as a treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron. As mentioned below under pharmacology, cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP.Oral 5-HTP results in an increase in urinary 5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite, indicating that 5-HTP is peripherally metabolized to serotonin, which is then metabolized. This might cause a false positive test in tests looking for carcinoid syndrome. Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, there could be a risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart, as based on preclinical findings. However, 5-HTP has not been associated with cardiac toxicity in humans.It has been suggested that 5-HTP may cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition which results in extreme muscle tenderness, myalgia, and blood abnormalities. However, there is evidence to show that EMS was likely caused by a contaminant in certain 5-HTP supplements.","Malignant Carcinoid Syndrome,[dsyn],68.74,C0024586|Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome,[dsyn],35.81,C0085179|Myalgia,[sosy],20.95,C0231528|Serotonin Syndrome,[inpo],19.98,C0699828|Disease,[dsyn],19.78,C0012634|Secondary Parkinson Disease,[dsyn],19.20,C0030569|Cardiotoxicity,[inpo],16.26,C0876994|In Blood,[bdsu],16.12,C0005768|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Blood,[bdsu],9.81,C0005767|Heart Valves,[bpoc],9.78,C0018826|Systemic Scleroderma,[dsyn],9.74,C0036421|Congenital Abnormality,[cgab],6.83,C0000768|Urinary tract,[bpoc],6.63,C0042027|Liver,[bpoc],6.59,C0023884|Heart,[bpoc],6.58,C0018787|Manic,[mobd],5.18,C0338831|Skeletal muscle tender,[sosy],3.61,C0575064|Scleroderma,[dsyn],3.43,C0011644|"

Recently, star anise has come into use in the West as a less expensive substitute for anise in baking, as well as in liquor production, most distinctively in the production of the liqueur Galliano. Star anise enhances the flavour of meat.It is used as a spice in preparation of biryani and masala chai all over the Indian subcontinent. It is widely used in Chinese cuisine, and in Malay and Indonesian cuisines. It is widely grown for commercial use in China, India, and most other countries in Asia. Star anise is an ingredient of the traditional five-spice powder of Chinese cooking. It is also a major ingredient in the making of ph , a Vietnamese noodle soup.
It is also used in the French recipe of mulled wine, called vin chaud (hot wine). If allowed to steep in coffee, it deepens and enriches the flavor. The pods can be used in this manner multiple times by the pot-full or cup, as the ease of extraction of the taste components increases with the permeation of hot water. 
 Star anise is the major source of the chemical compound shikimic acid, a primary precursor in the pharmaceutical synthesis of the antiinfluenza drug, oseltamivir (Tamiflu). An industrial method for the production of shikimic acid using fermentation of E. coli bacteria was discovered in 2005, and applied in the 2009 swine flu outbreak to address Tamiflu shortages, also causing price increases for star anise as a raw material of shikimic acid. As of 2018, fermentation of E. coli was the manufacturing process of choice to produce shikimic acid for synthesis of Tamiflu.. Study shows Star Anise can be used as anti quorum sensing and anti-biofilm agent in food matrix.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.21,C0682897|Amniotic Fluid,[bdsu],9.86,C0002638|Hot Temperature,[npop],45.16,C2350229|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.47,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],20.95,C0682897|Taste Perception,[ortf],12.88,C0039336|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],9.81,C0024809|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.05,C0008300|Fermentation,[moft],13.03,C0015852|Influenza,[dsyn],13.01,C0021400|quorum sensing,[celf],9.92,C1154599|Disease Outbreaks,[phpr],9.86,C0012652|"

"('hyacinth bean', 'Uses')","The hyacinth bean is an old domesticated pulse and multi-purpose crop. Due to seed availability of one forage cultivar (cv. Rongai), it is often grown as forage for livestock and as an ornamental plant. In addition, it is cited both as a medicinal plant and a poisonous plant.The fruit and beans are edible if boiled well with several changes of the water. Otherwise, they are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, glycosides that are converted to hydrogen cyanide when consumed. Signs of poisoning include weakness, vomiting, dyspnea, twitching, stupor, and convulsions. It has been shown that there is a wide range of cyanogenic potential among the varieties.The leaves are eaten raw or cooked like spinach. The flowers can be eaten raw or steamed. The root can be boiled or baked for food. The seeds are used to make tofu and tempeh.In India its called  Surti Papdi . In Bangladesh and West Bengal, the green pods along with the beans, known as Sheem (   ), are cooked as vegetables or cooked with fish as a curry.
In China, the seeds are known as Bai Bian Dou. They are usually dried and baked before being used in traditional Chinese herbal remedies to strengthen spleen, reduce heat and dampness, and promote appetite. In Kerala, it is known as Amarakka, Avara or Amara Payar (Malayalam:         ). The beans as well as the bean pods are used in cooking curries. The bean pods are also used (along with spices) for preparing stir-fried dish known as Thoran.In Maharashtra, dry preparations with green masala is often made out of these green beans (Ghevda varieties - Shravan ghevda (french beans), Bajirao Ghevda, Ghevda, Walwar, Pavta sheng..) mostly found at the end of monsoon during fasting festivals of Shravan month.In Karnataka, the hyacinth bean is made into curry (avarekalu saaru)(Kannada:              ), salad (avarekaalu usli), added to upma (avrekaalu uppittu), and as a flavoring to Akki rotti. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called hitakubele avarekalu, which means ""pressed (hitaku) hyancinth bean,"" and a curry known as Hitikida Avarekaalu Saaru is made out of the deskinned beans.In Telangana and Andra Pradesh, the bean pods are cut into small pieces and cooked as spicy curry in Pongal festival season. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed when tender and soaked over night is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called pitakapappu,hanupa/anapa, which means ""pressed (pitaku) hyancinth bean, and a curry known as Pitikida Anapaginjala Chaaru is made out of this deskinned beans along with bajra bread; it has been a very special delicacy for centuries.In Hu , Vietnam, hyacinth beans are the main ingredient of the dish ch    u v n (Hyacinth Bean Sweet Soup).In Kenya, the bean called 'Njahe' is popular among several communities, especially the Kikuyu. Seasons were actually based on it i.e the Season of Njahe (K mera k a njah ). It is thought to encourage lactation and has historically been the main dish for breastfeeding mothers. Beans are boiled and mashed with ripe and/or semi-ripe bananas, giving the dish a sweet taste.  Today the production is in decline in eastern Africa. This is partly attributed to the fact that under colonial rule in Kenya, farmers were forced to give up their local bean in order to produce common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) for export.","Eating,[orgf],26.03,C0013470|Stupor,[mobd],24.11,C0085628|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Pulse Rate,[clna],16.21,C0232117|Multiple Chronic Conditions,[dsyn],16.07,C3266262|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Dyspnea,[sosy],14.64,C0013404|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|furuncle,[dsyn],8.00,C0242301|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.74,C0010352|Poisoning,[inpo],6.60,C0032343|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],104.76,C0020498|Breast Feeding,[orgf],38.95,C0006147|Desiccation,[npop],19.89,C0011682|Festivals,[acty],19.75,C0015922|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Desire for food,[orgf],17.80,C0003618|Spleen,[bpoc],17.80,C0037993|Fasting,[fndg],16.04,C0015663|Lactation,[ortf],14.64,C0022925|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],12.88,C0221023|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Heat (physical force),[npop],5.18,C0018837|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|"
"('ginkgo nut', 'Uses')","Ginkgos are popular subjects for growing as penjing and bonsai; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed. 
 The nut-like gametophytes inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in congee, and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha's delight). In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also consider them to have aphrodisiac qualities. Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called ginnan) to dishes such as chawanmushi, and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes.
When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6).
Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating. These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing disposable gloves. The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis or blisters similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy. 
 The first use as a medicine is recorded in the late 15th century in China; among western countries, its first registered medicinal use was in Germany in 1965. Despite use, controlled studies do not support the extract's efficacy for most of the indicated conditions. 
 Although extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaf sold as dietary supplements may be marketed as being beneficial for cognitive function, there is no evidence for effects on memory or attention in healthy people. Gingko extract has also been studied in Alzheimer's disease, but there is no good evidence that it has any effect.Systematic reviews have shown there is no evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, peripheral arterial disease, macular degeneration, or altitude sickness. 
 The use of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants, such as aspirin or warfarin, although studies have found ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects. Additional side effects include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness.According to a systemic review, the effects of ginkgo on pregnant women may include increased bleeding time, and it should be avoided during lactation because of inadequate safety evidence.Ginkgo biloba leaves and sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids, which are highly allergenic, long-chain alkylphenols such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other Toxicodendron spp.) Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations, combinations, or extracts thereof. The level of these allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from Ginkgo biloba was restricted to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority. Overconsumption of seeds from Gingko biloba can deplete vitamin B6.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.08,C0020498|Gametophytes,[cell],16.18,C2717773|Eating,[orgf],12.99,C0013470|Gametophytes,[cell],17.80,C2717773|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Poisoning,[inpo],6.71,C0032343|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.68,C0018837|Dermatitis, Allergic Contact,[dsyn],17.80,C0162820|Bulla,[anab],14.64,C0005758|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.44,C0009830|Disease,[dsyn],9.71,C0012634|Peripheral Arterial Diseases,[dsyn],20.95,C1704436|Tinnitus,[dsyn],20.95,C0040264|Alzheimer's Disease,[dsyn],16.26,C0002395|Cerebrovascular accident,[dsyn],16.09,C0038454|Age related macular degeneration,[dsyn],14.64,C0242383|Memory,[menp],14.64,C0025260|Impaired cognition,[mobd],13.14,C0338656|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Altitude Sickness,[dsyn],11.49,C0002351|Peripheral Vascular Diseases,[dsyn],11.49,C0085096|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],10.11,C0020538|Cognition,[menp],9.79,C0009240|Mental deterioration,[mobd],3.68,C0234985|Psychomotor Agitation,[fndg],20.95,C3887612|Breast Feeding,[orgf],19.36,C0006147|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Allergic Reaction,[patf],13.59,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],13.59,C0020517|Lactation,[ortf],13.05,C0022925|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Hemorrhage,[patf],9.75,C0019080|Hematological Disease,[dsyn],6.93,C0018939|Heart,[bpoc],6.66,C0018787|"

The dried bulbs are commonly used in the south to flavor soup. Lily flowers are also said to be efficacious in pulmonary affections, and to have tonic properties.   Lily flowers and bulbs are eaten especially in the summer, for their perceived ability to reduce internal heat. They may be reconstituted and stir-fried, grated and used to thicken soup, or processed to extract starch. Their texture and taste draw comparisons with the potato, although the individual bulb scales are much smaller.  There are also species which are meant to be suitable for culinary and/or herb uses. There are five traditional lily species whose bulbs are certified and classified as ""vegetable and non-staple foodstuffs"" on the National geographical indication product list of China.

"('cogongrass rhizome', 'Cultivation and uses')","It is used for thatching the roofs of traditional homes throughout south-east Asia.

It is planted extensively for ground cover and soil stabilization near beach areas and other areas subject to erosion. Other uses include paper-making, thatching and weaving into mats and bags. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine.A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use as ornamental plants, including the red-leaved 'Red Baron', also known as Japanese blood grass.
Young inflorescences and shoots may be eaten cooked, and the roots contain starch and sugars and are therefore easy to chew.It is used as an ingredient in the skincare brand Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream for its high concentrations of potassium which provides a hydrating effect. Their website also states that indigenous native Australians may have used the plant as a substitute for salt due to its high saline content.The plant has become naturalized in the Americas, Northern Asia, Europe and Africa in addition to many islands and is listed as an invasive weed in some areas. In the U.S. it survives best in the Southeast (and, according to a 2003 survey, has overtaken more acreage in that region than the notorious kudzu), but has been reported to exist as far north as West Virginia and Oregon. Worldwide it has been observed from 45 N to 45 S. It grows on wet lands, dry lands, areas of high salinity, organic soils, clay soils and sandy soils of pH from 4.0 to 7.5. It prefers full sun but will tolerate some shade. In Florida I. cylindrica is found in areas where the soil has been disturbed, such as roadsides, building sites, timber harvesting areas, and borrow pits. It is able to invade both moist and dry upland pine forests. Once established it often forms dense monocultures.In addition to outcompeting species for resources, the grass also exhibits allelopathic tendencies. The chemicals it releases as well as the dense mat of vegetation that usually accompanies a cogongrass invasion gives it an advantage over indigenous plants.It spreads both through small seeds, which are easily carried by the wind, and rhizomes which can be transported by tilling equipment and in soil transport.
In the Southeastern United States, state governments have various eradication efforts in place, and deliberate propagation is prohibited by some authorities. Control is typically by the use of herbicides. Currently, the most effective herbicides used to control growth are glyphosate and imazapyr. Burnoff is seldom successful since the grass burns at a high temperature causing heat damage to trees which would ordinarily be undamaged by a controlled burn and recovers from a burn quickly. Quarantine and extermination of this plant is especially difficult because cogongrass establishes root systems as deep as four feet, and regrowth can be triggered by rhizome segments as small as one inch.Cogongrass is difficult to contain mainly because it is highly adaptive to harsher environments, establishing itself on soils low in fertility. The grass also can grow on sand and clay, and consumers of it are few. The grass tends to be averse to dense shade, but reports indicate more shade-tolerant strains are developing.The legume vine Mucuna pruriens is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for Imperata cylindrica.","In Blood,[bdsu],16.18,C0005768|Soil,[sbst],12.89,C0037592|Blood,[bdsu],9.87,C0005767|Soil,[sbst],68.97,C0037592|Environmental Wind,[npop],22.49,C0043187|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Desiccation,[npop],19.70,C0011682|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|Chewing,[orgf],17.80,C0024888|Forests,[npop],16.23,C0086312|Saline Solution,[sbst],16.04,C0036082|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Biological Transport,[celf],13.49,C0005528|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|Van der Woude syndrome,[dsyn],13.44,C0175697|Flatulence,[sosy],13.03,C0016204|Carrying,[acty],9.88,C0206243|Salinity,[lbtr],9.75,C1956027|Allelopathy,[npop],6.60,C3658358|Mental concentration,[menp],3.42,C0086045|Burn injury,[inpo],20.30,C0006434|Precipitating Factors,[clna],16.15,C0032930|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.05,C0040452|Foot,[bpoc],13.14,C0016504|Soil,[sbst],13.05,C0037592|Fever,[sosy],13.03,C0015967|Acclimatization,[orgf],12.96,C0000934|Growth,[orgf],11.49,C0018270|Reproduction,[orgf],9.91,C0035150|Fertility,[orgf],9.76,C0015895|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.68,C0080194|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.54,C0018837|"

Castor oil is an effective motor lubricant and has been used in internal combustion engines, including those of World War I airplanes, some racing cars and some model airplanes. It has historically been popular for lubricating two-stroke engines due to high resistance to heat compared to petroleum-based oils. It does not mix well with petroleum products, particularly at low temperatures, but mixes better with the methanol based fuels used in glow model engines. In total-loss-lubrication applications, it tends to leave carbon deposits and varnish within the engine. It has been largely replaced by synthetic oils that are more stable and less toxic.

"('castor bean', 'Habitat, growth and horticultural uses')","Although Ricinus communis is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, today it is widespread throughout tropical regions. In areas with a suitable climate, castor establishes itself easily where it can become an invasive plant and can often be found on wasteland.
It is also used extensively as a decorative plant in parks and other public areas, particularly as a ""dot plant"" in traditional bedding schemes. If sown early, under glass, and kept at a temperature of around 20  C (68  F) until planted out, the castor oil plant can reach a height of 2 3 metres (6.6 9.8 ft) in a year. In areas prone to frost it is usually shorter, and grown as if it were an annual. However, it can grow well outdoors in cooler climates, at least in southern England, and the leaves do not appear to suffer frost damage in sheltered spots, where it remains evergreen. It was used in Edwardian times in the parks of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Although not cultivated there, the plant grows wild in Southern California, notably Griffith Park in Los Angeles.Selections have been made by breeders for use as ornamental plants (heights refer to plants grown as annuals) and for commercial production of castor oil.

"('castor bean', 'Toxicity')","The toxicity of raw castor beans is due to the presence of ricin. Although the lethal dose in adults is considered to be four to eight seeds, reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare. According to the Guinness World Records, this is the world's most poisonous common plant. Symptoms of overdosing on ricin, which can include nausea, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypotension and seizures, persist for up to a week. However, the poison can be extracted from castor by concentrating it with a fairly complicated process similar to that used for extracting cyanide from almonds.
If ricin is ingested, symptoms may be delayed by up to 36 hours but commonly begin within 2 4 hours. These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3 5 days; however, in most cases a full recovery can be made.Poisoning occurs when animals, including humans, ingest broken seeds or break the seed by chewing: intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. The toxin provides the castor oil plant with some degree of natural protection from insect pests such as aphids. Ricin has been investigated for its potential use as an insecticide. The castor oil plant is also the source for undecylenic acid, a natural fungicide.
Commercially available cold-pressed castor oil is not toxic to humans in normal doses, either internal or externally.","Drug Overdose,[inpo],16.05,C0029944|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Tachycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0039231|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Poisoning,[inpo],6.72,C0032343|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.75,C0030685|Plague,[dsyn],19.29,C0032064|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|In Blood,[bdsu],16.07,C0005768|Chewing,[orgf],16.05,C0024888|Dehydration,[dsyn],13.14,C0011175|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.14,C0011991|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],11.49,C0031354|Hypotension,[fndg],10.12,C0020649|Esthesia,[ortf],9.99,C0036658|Blood,[bdsu],9.76,C0005767|Urine,[bdsu],9.75,C0042036|Poisoning,[inpo],8.34,C0032343|Burn injury,[inpo],6.63,C0006434|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.38,C0009264|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.92,C0009443|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.76,C0041912|"
"('castor bean', 'Modern commercial usage')","Global castor seed production is around two million tons per year. Leading producing areas are India (with over three-quarters of the global yield), China and Mozambique, and it is widely grown as a crop in Ethiopia. There are several active breeding programmes.Whether natural, blended, or chemically altered, castor oil still has many uses. For example, it remains of commercial importance as a non-freezing, antimicrobial, pressure-resistant lubricant for special purposes, either of latex or metals, or as a lubricating component of fuels.
Castor products are sources of various chemical feedstocks.
In Brazil, castor oil (locally known as mamona oil) is a raw material for some varieties of biodiesel.
In rural areas, the abundant seeds are used by children for slingshot balls, as they have the right weight, size, and hardness.
Because castor seeds are attractively patterned, they are popular in low-cost personal adornments, such as non-durable necklaces and bracelets.
Castor oil has long been used on the skin to prevent dryness. Either purified or processed, it still is a component of many cosmetics.
The high percentage of ricinoleic acid residues in castor oil and its derivatives, inhibits many microbes, whether viral, bacterial or fungal. They accordingly are useful components of many ointments and similar preparations.
Castor oil is the major raw material for polyglycerol polyricinoleate, a modifier that improves the flow characteristics of cocoa butter in the manufacture of chocolate bars, and thereby the costs.

"('areca nut', 'Effects on health')","Habitual chewers of betel leaf and areca nut have a greatly increased risk of developing a range of serious diseases, including cancers of the mouth and esophagus. It has many systemic effects (see box).Chewing areca nut alone has been linked to oral submucosal fibrosis. According to Medline Plus, ""Long-term use [of betel-areca preparations] has been associated with oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF), pre-cancerous oral lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Acute effects of betel chewing include asthma exacerbation, hypertension, and tachycardia.  There may additionally be a higher risk of cancers of the liver, mouth, esophagus, stomach, prostate, cervix, and lung with regular betel use.  Other effects can include altered blood sugar levels, which may in turn increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.""Use of areca nut has been associated with deterioration of psychosis in people with preexisting psychiatric disorders. Areca nut consumption is also tied to chronic kidney disease in men.In 2003 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a World Health Organization sponsored group, found sufficient evidence that the habit of chewing betel quid, with or without tobacco, causes cancer in humans. Support for this conclusion is provided by a recent study which found that paan, even without concurrent tobacco use, is a risk factor for oral cancer. In October 2009, 30 scientists from 10 countries met at IARC to reassess the carcinogenicity of various agents including areca nut, and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. They confirmed there is sufficient evidence that areca nut, with or without tobacco, can cause cancer.The harm caused by consumption of betel quid or areca nut by hundreds of millions of people worldwide (mainly with southern and eastern Asian origins and connections) has been characterized as a ""neglected global public health emergency"".Chewing paan (and/or other areca nut and betel leaf formulations) during pregnancy significantly increases adverse outcomes for the baby. The habit is associated with higher incidences of preterm birth and low birth weight and height. Biologically, these effects may be a consequence of the arecoline that is found in areca nuts.

Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth (caused by its 3% of hydroxy alpha sanshool) that sets the stage for hot spices. According to Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking, they are not simply pungent; ""they produce a strange, tingling, buzzing, numbing sensation that is something like the effect of carbonated drinks or of a mild electric current (touching the terminals of a nine-volt battery to the tongue). Sanshools appear to act on several different kinds of nerve endings at once, induce sensitivity to touch and cold in nerves that are ordinarily nonsensitive, and so perhaps cause a kind of general neurological confusion.""Recipes often suggest lightly toasting the tiny seed pods, then crushing them before adding them to food. Only the husks are used; the shiny black seeds are discarded or ignored as they have a very gritty, sand-like texture. The spice is generally added at the last moment. Star anise and ginger are often used with it in spicy Sichuan cuisine. It has an alkaline pH and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses.

It is also a common flavouring in Sichuan baked goods such as sweetened cakes and biscuits. Beijing microbrewery Great Leap Brewing uses Sichuan peppercorns, offset by honey, as a flavouring adjunct in its Honey Ma Blonde.Sichuan pepper is also available as an oil (Chinese:    , marketed as either ""Sichuan pepper oil"", ""Bunge prickly ash oil"", or ""huajiao oil""). In this form, it is best used in stir-fry noodle dishes without hot spices. The recipe may include ginger oil and brown sugar cooked with a base of noodles and vegetables, then adding rice vinegar and Sichuan pepper oil after cooking.Hua jiao yan (simplified Chinese:    ; traditional Chinese:    ; pinyin: hu ji oy n) is a mixture of salt and Sichuan pepper, toasted and browned in a wok, and served as a condiment to accompany chicken, duck, and pork dishes. The peppercorns can also be lightly fried to make a spicy oil with various uses.
In Indonesian Batak cuisine, andaliman (a relative of Sichuan pepper, Z. acanthopodium) is ground and mixed with chilies and seasonings into a green sambal tinombur or chili paste, to accompany grilled pork, carp, and other regional specialties.

In Mexico and the Southwest United States, cebollitas are scallions that are sprinkled with salt, grilled whole and eaten with cheese and rice. Topped with lime juice, they are typically served as a traditional accompaniment to asado dishes.In Catalan cuisine, cal ot is a type of onion traditionally eaten in a cal otada (plural: cal otades). A popular gastronomic event of the same name is held between the end of winter and early spring, where cal ots are grilled, dipped in salvitxada or romesco sauce, and consumed in massive quantities.In Japan, tree onions (wakegi) are used mostly as topping of Japanese cuisine such like tofu.
In Vietnam, Welsh onion is important to prepare d a h nh (fermented onions) which is served for T t, the Vietnamese New Year. A kind of sauce, m  h nh (Welsh onion fried in oil), is used in dishes such as c m t m, b nh  t and c  t m n  ng. Welsh onion is the main ingredient in the dish ch o h nh, which is a rice porridge used to treat the common cold.
In India, it is eaten raw as an appetizer. In north India, coriander, mint and onion chutney are made using uncooked scallions. It is also used as a vegetable with Chapatis & Rotis.
In the United Kingdom, scallions are normally chopped and added to mashed potatoes, or as an added ingredient to potato salad.
In the southern Philippines, it is ground in a mortar along with  ginger and chili pepper to make a native condiment called wet palapa, which can be used to spice dishes or as a topping for fried or sun-dried food. It can also be used to make the dry version of palapa, when it is stir fried with fresh coconut shavings and wet palapa.
During the Passover meal (Seder), some Persian Jews whack each other with scallions before singing the song ""Dayenu"", symbolizing the whips endured by the Israelites under the ancient Egyptians.Scallion oil is sometimes made from the green leaves. The leaves are chopped and lightly cooked, then emulsified in oil that is then used as a garnish.","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.25,C0020498|Natural Springs,[npop],13.01,C3179043|Eating,[orgf],26.16,C0013470|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.25,C0020498|Natural Springs,[npop],13.04,C3179043|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],53.52,C0268059|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.38,C0020498|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],12.88,C0221023|Eating,[orgf],12.87,C0013470|Sunlight,[npop],19.25,C0038817|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.15,C0020498|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|Singing,[inbe],14.64,C0234857|"
"('rhubarb', 'Uses')","Rhubarb is grown primarily for its fleshy leafstalks, technically known as petioles. The use of rhubarb stalks as food is a relatively recent innovation. This usage was first recorded in 18th to 19th-century England after affordable sugar became more widely available.Commonly, it is stewed with sugar or used in pies and desserts, but it can also be put into savoury dishes or pickled. Rhubarb can be dehydrated and infused with fruit juice. In the United States, it is usually infused with strawberry juice to mimic the there popular strawberry rhubarb pie.The species Rheum ribes has been eaten in the Islamic world since the 10th century.In Northern Europe and North America the stalks are commonly cut into pieces and stewed with added sugar until soft. The resulting compote, sometimes thickened with corn starch, can then be used in pies, tarts and crumbles. Alternatively, greater quantities of sugar can be added with pectin to make jams. The most popular accompanying spice to use is ginger, although cinnamon and nutmeg are also popular additions. 
In the United States the common usage of rhubarb in pies has led to it being nicknamed  pie plant , by which it is referred to in many 19th century US cookbooks. Rhubarb in the US is also often paired with strawberries to make strawberry-rhubarb pie, though some rhubarb purists jokingly consider this ""a rather unhappy marriage"".In the United Kingdom, as well as being used in the typical pies, tarts and crumbles, rhubarb compote is also combined with whipped cream and/or custard to make respectively rhubarb fool and rhubarb and custard. 
In former days, a common and affordable sweet for children in parts of the United Kingdom and Sweden was a tender stick of rhubarb, dipped in sugar. It is still eaten this way in western Finland, Norway, Canada, Iceland, Lithuania, the Faroe Islands and Sweden, and also some other parts of the world.
Rhubarb can also be used to make alcoholic drinks, such as fruit wines or Finnish Rhubarb sima (mead). It is also used to make Kompot. Being a bit sour, it is very refreshing and can be drunk cold, especially during the summer.

"('rhubarb', 'Toxicity')","Rhubarb leaves contain poisonous substances, including oxalic acid, which is a nephrotoxic acid that is present in many plants. Humans have been poisoned after ingesting the leaves, a particular problem during World War I when the leaves were mistakenly recommended as a food source in Britain. The toxic rhubarb leaves have been used in flavouring extracts, after the oxalic acid is removed by treatment with precipitated chalk (i.e., calcium carbonate).
The LD50 (median lethal dose) for pure oxalic acid in rats is about 375 mg/kg body weight, or about 25 grams for a 65-kilogram (143 lb) human. Other sources give a much higher oral LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) of 600 mg/kg. While the oxalic acid content of rhubarb leaves can vary, a typical value is about 0.5%, meaning a 65 kg adult would need to eat 4 to 8 kg (9 to 18 lbs) to obtain a lethal dose, depending on which lethal dose is assumed.  Cooking the leaves with baking soda can make them more poisonous by producing soluble oxalates. The leaves are believed to also contain an additional, unidentified toxin, which might be an anthraquinone glycoside (also known as senna glycosides).In the petioles (leaf stalks), the proportion of oxalic acid is much lower, only about a tenth of the total acidity of 2 2.5%, which consists mostly of malic acid.Serious cases of rhubarb poisoning are not well documented in modern medical publications. It is thought that both fatal and non-fatal cases of rhubarb poisoning have not been caused by oxalates, but rather by toxic anthraquinone glycosides. Such cases of rhubarb poisoning do not feature the corrosive gastroenteritis that accompanies ingestion of high levels of oxalic acid.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|World War I,[acty],19.24,C1449759|Body Weight,[orga],22.56,C0005910|Poisoning,[inpo],20.06,C0032343|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],16.30,C0935572|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Heartburn,[sosy],13.00,C0018834|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Gastroenteritis,[dsyn],9.99,C0017160|"

"('jujube date', 'Cultivation and uses')","Jujube was domesticated in south Asia by 9000 BC.  Over 400 cultivars have been selected.
The tree tolerates a wide range of temperatures and rainfall, though it requires hot summers and sufficient water for acceptable fruiting. Unlike most of the other species in the genus, it tolerates fairly cold winters, surviving temperatures down to about  15  C (5  F) and the tree is for instance commonly cultivated in Beijing. This enables the jujube to grow in mountain or desert habitats, provided there is access to underground water throughout the summer. The jujube, Z. jujuba grows in cooler regions of Asia. Five or more other species of Ziziphus are widely distributed in milder climates to hot deserts of Asia and Africa.In Madagascar, jujube trees grow extensively in the western half of the island, from the north all the way to the south. It is widely eaten by free-ranging zebus, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces. It is  an invasive species there, threatening mostly protected areas.The freshly harvested, as well as the candied dried fruit, are often eaten as a snack, or with coffee. Smoked jujubes are consumed in  Vietnam and are referred to as black jujubes. Both China and Korea produce a sweetened tea syrup containing jujube fruit in glass jars, and canned jujube tea or jujube tea in the form of teabags. To a lesser extent, jujube fruit is made into juice and jujube vinegar (called    or     in Chinese). They are used for making pickles (          ) in west Bengal and Bangladesh. In China, a wine made from jujube fruit is called hong zao jiu (   ).
Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with baijiu (Chinese liquor), which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time, especially through the winter. Such jujubes are called jiu zao (  ; literally ""alcohol jujube""). The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies (e.g.    jing gao, a steamed rice cake).
In Vietnam and Taiwan, fully mature, nearly ripe fruit is harvested and sold on the local markets and also exported to Southeast Asian countries. The dried fruit is used in desserts in China and Vietnam, such as ching bo leung, a cold beverage that includes the dried jujube, longan, fresh seaweed, barley, and lotus seeds.In Korea, jujubes are called daechu (  ) and are used in daechucha teas and samgyetang.
In Croatia, especially Dalmatia, jujubes are used in marmalades, juices, and rakija (fruit brandy).
On his visit to Medina, the 19th-century English explorer, Sir Richard Burton, observed that the local variety of jujube fruit was widely eaten. He  describes its taste as ""like a bad plum, an unrepentant cherry and an insipid apple."" He gives the local names for three varieties as ""Hindi (Indian), Baladi (native), Tamri (date-like)."" In Palestine a hundred years ago, a close variety was common in the Jordan valley and around Jerusalem. The bedouin valued the fruit, calling it nabk. It could be dried and kept for winter or made into a paste which was used as bread.In Persian cuisine, the dried drupes are known as annab, while in neighboring Azerbaijan, it is commonly eaten as a snack, and is known as innab. Confusion in the common name apparently is widespread. The innab is Z. jujuba: the local name ber is not used for innab. Rather, ber is used for three other cultivated or wild species, e.g., Z. spina-christi, Z. mauritiana, and Z. nummularia in parts of India and is eaten both fresh and dried. The Arabic name sidr is used for Ziziphus species other than Z. jujuba.
Traditionally in India, the fruit is dried in the sun and the hard nuts are removed. Then, it is pounded with tamarind, red chillies, salt, and jaggery. In some parts of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, fresh whole ripe fruit is crushed with the above ingredients and dried under the sun to make cakes called ilanthai vadai or regi vadiyalu (Telugu). It is also commonly consumed as a snack.
In Northern and Northeastern India the fruit is eaten fresh with salt and chilli flakes and also preserved as candy, jam or pickle with oil and spices. 
In Madagascar, jujube fruit is eaten fresh or dried. People also use it to make jam. A jujube honey is produced in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.Italy has an alcoholic syrup called brodo di giuggiole.
In Senegal Jujube is called Sii dem and the fruit is used as snack. The fruit is turned into dried paste used by school kids.
The commercial jujube candy popular in movie theaters originally contained jujube juice but now uses other flavorings.

It is among the fruits used in Kampo.
Ziziphin, a compound in the leaves of the jujube, suppresses the ability to perceive sweet taste.

Its hard, oily wood was, along with pear, used for woodcuts to print the world's first books, starting in the 8th century and continuing through the 19th in China and neighboring countries. As many as 2000 copies could be produced from one jujube woodcut. In China, the leaves are sometimes picked for teas, such as by families in Laoshan Village, Shandong Province, China, where it counts as a variety of herbal tea.

During World War II, soybeans became important in both North America and Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil. During the war, the soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the United States Department of Agriculture.Soybean meal, or soymeal, is the material remaining after solvent extraction of oil from soybean flakes, with a 50% soy protein content. The meal is 'toasted' (a misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam) and ground in a hammer mill. Ninety-seven percent of soybean meal production globally is used as livestock feed. Soybean meal is also used in some dog foods.

During World War II, soybeans became important in both North America and Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil. During the war, the soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the United States Department of Agriculture.One of the major uses of soybeans globally is as livestock feed, predominantly in the form of soybean meal. Spring grasses are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, whereas soy is predominantly omega-6. The soybean hulls, which mainly consist of the outer coats of the beans removed before oil extraction, can also be fed to livestock, as well as whole soybean seeds after processing.

During World War II, soybeans became important in both North America and Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil. During the war, the soybean was discovered as fertilizer by the United States Department of Agriculture.In addition to their use in livestock feed, soybean products are widely used for human consumption. Common soybean products include soy sauce, soy milk, tofu, soy meal, soy flour, textured vegetable protein (TVP), tempeh, soy lecithin and soybean oil. Soybeans may also be eaten with minimal processing, for example in the Japanese food edamame (  , edamame), in which immature soybeans are boiled whole in their pods and served with salt.

In China, Japan, and Korea, soybean and soybean products are a common part of the diet. Tofu (   d ufu) is thought to have originated in China, along with soy sauce and several varieties of soybean paste used as seasonings. Japanese foods made from soya include miso (  ), natt  (  ), kinako (  ) and edamame (  ), as well as products made with tofu such as atsuage and aburaage. In China, whole dried soybeans are sold in supermarkets and used to cook a variety of dishes, usually after rehydration by soaking in water; they find their use in soup or as a savory dish. In Korean cuisine, soybean sprouts (    kongnamul) are used in a variety of dishes, and are the base ingredient in doenjang, cheonggukjang and ganjang. In Vietnam, soybeans are used to make soybean paste (t  ng) in the North with the most popular products are t  ng B n, t  ng Nam   n, t  ng C     as a garnish for ph  and g i cu n dishes, as well as tofu (  u h  or   u ph  or t u h ), soy sauce (n  c t  ng), soy milk (n  c   u in the North or s a   u n nh in the South), and   u h  n  c    ng (tofu sweet soup).Soy flour refers to soybeans ground finely enough to pass through a 100-mesh or smaller screen where special care was taken during desolventizing (not toasted) to minimize denaturation of the protein to retain a high protein dispersibility index, for uses such as food extrusion of textured vegetable protein. It is the starting material for production of soy concentrate and soy protein isolate.
Soy flour can also be made by roasting the soybean, removing the coat (hull), and grinding into a flour. Soy flour is manufactured with different fat levels. Alternatively, raw soy flour omits the roasting step.

Defatted soy flour is obtained from solvent extracted flakes, and contains less than 1% oil.
""Natural or full-fat soy flour is made from unextracted, dehulled beans, and contains about 18% to 20% oil."" Its high oil content requires the use of a specialized Alpine Fine Impact Mill to grind rather than the usual hammer mill. Full-fat soy flour has a lower protein concentration than defatted flour. Extruded Full-Fat soy flour, ground in an Alpine mill, can replace/extend EGGS in baking and cooking Full-fat soy flour is a component of the famous Cornell Bread recipe (think pizza)
Low-fat soy flour is made by adding some oil back into defatted soy flour. Fat levels range from 4.5% to 9%.
High-fat soy flour can also be produced by adding back soybean oil to defatted flour, usually at the level of 15%.Soy lecithin can be added (up to 15%) to soy flour to make lecithinated soy flour. It increases dispersibility and gives it emulsifying properties.Soy flour has 50% protein and 5% fiber. It has higher levels of protein, thiamine, riboflavin, phosphorus, calcium, and iron than wheat flour. It does not contain gluten. As a result, yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture. Among many uses, soy flour thickens sauces, prevents staling in baked food, and reduces oil absorption during frying. Baking food with soy flour gives it tenderness, moistness, a rich color, and a fine texture.Soy grits are similar to soy flour except the soybeans have been toasted and cracked into coarse pieces.
Kinako is a soy flour used in Japanese cuisine.

It is sold in powdered, ready-to-feed, and concentrated liquid forms.
Some reviews have expressed the opinion that more research is needed to determine what effect the phytoestrogens in soybeans may have on infants. Diverse studies have concluded there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula. One of these studies, published in the Journal of Nutrition, concludes that there are:

... no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional adequacy, sexual development, neurobehavioral development, immune development, or thyroid disease. SBIFs provide complete nutrition that adequately supports normal infant growth and development. FDA has accepted SBIFs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition.

For example, soybeans are the primary ingredient in many dairy product substitutes (e.g., soy milk, margarine, soy ice cream, soy yogurt, soy cheese, and soy cream cheese) and meat alternatives (e.g. veggie burgers). These substitutes are readily available in most supermarkets. Soy milk does not naturally contain significant amounts of digestible calcium. Many manufacturers of soy milk sell calcium-enriched products, as well. Soy is also used in tempeh: the beans (sometimes mixed with grain) are fermented into a solid cake.
Soy products also are used as a low-cost substitute in meat and poultry products. Food service, retail and institutional (primarily school lunch and correctional) facilities regularly use such ""extended"" products. Extension may result in diminished flavor, but fat and cholesterol are reduced. Vitamin and mineral fortification can be used to make soy products nutritionally equivalent to animal protein; the protein quality is already roughly equivalent. The soy-based meat substitute textured vegetable protein has been used for more than 50 years as a way of inexpensively extending ground beef without reducing its nutritional value.

Soybeans are also used in industrial products, including oils, soap, cosmetics, resins, plastics, inks, crayons, solvents, and clothing. Soybean oil is the primary source of biodiesel in the United States, accounting for 80% of domestic biodiesel production. Soybeans have also been used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of vodka. In 1936, Ford Motor Company developed a method where soybeans and fibers were rolled together producing a soup which was then pressed into various parts for their cars, from the distributor cap to knobs on the dash board. Ford also informed in public relation releases that in 1935 over five million acres (20,000 km2) was dedicated to growing soybeans in the United States.","Avian crop,[bpoc],6.74,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.68,C0018837|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|Fish-Eye Disease,[dsyn],24.11,C0342895|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Natural Springs,[npop],12.91,C3179043|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Protein Denaturation,[moft],16.24,C0033627|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Mental concentration,[menp],3.55,C0086045|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.03,C2347023|Lopes Gorlin syndrome,[dsyn],13.00,C1838328|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Fish-Eye Disease,[dsyn],24.11,C0342895|Vegan diet,[fndg],20.95,C0344353|Breast Feeding,[orgf],19.75,C0006147|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Nutritional status,[fndg],13.01,C0392209|Reproduction,[orgf],9.84,C0035150|Growth,[orgf],9.74,C0018270|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.42,C0009830|Nutritional status,[fndg],26.12,C0392209|Sexual Development,[orgf],11.49,C0233896|Growth,[orgf],10.09,C0018270|Thyroid Diseases,[dsyn],8.34,C0040128|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Physiologic calcification,[ortf],28.74,C0006660|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|furuncle,[dsyn],10.52,C0242301|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Paste substance,[sbst],7.38,C0030634|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.48,C0020498|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Native American myopathy,[dsyn],12.93,C1850625|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],12.88,C0268059|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.74,C0012159|Paste substance,[sbst],7.10,C0030634|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.79,C0010352|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|War,[acty],17.80,C0043027|Confusion,[mobd],16.18,C0009676|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Plastics,[sbst],17.80,C0032167|"
"('fermented soybean', 'Health')","According to the American Cancer Society, ""There is growing evidence that eating traditional soy foods such as tofu may lower the risk of cancers of the breast, prostate, or endometrium (lining of the uterus), and there is some evidence it may lower the risk of certain other cancers."" There is insufficient research to indicate whether taking soy dietary supplements has any effect on health or cancer risk.  Reviews of preliminary clinical trials on people with colorectal  or gastrointestinal cancer indicated a small lower risk by consuming soy isoflavones. 
 Saponins, a class of natural surfactants (soaps), are sterols present naturally in small amounts in various plant foods, including soybeans, other legumes, and cereals, such as oats.Soy isoflavones are polyphenol compounds, produced by soybeans and other legumes, including peanuts and chickpeas. Isoflavones are closely related to flavonoids found in other plants, vegetables and flowers.Soybeans contain the isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, which are phytoestrogen compounds under preliminary research in cardiovascular diseases and numerous other diseases. As of 2013, no cause-and-effect relationship has been shown in clinical research to indicate that soy isoflavones lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases or respiratory infections. 
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the following health claim for soy: ""25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease."" One serving, (1 cup or 240 mL) of soy milk, for instance, contains 6 or 7 grams of soy protein.
An American Heart Association (AHA) review of a decade long study of soy protein benefits did not recommend isoflavone supplementation. The review panel also found that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post-menopausal ""hot flashes"" and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help prevent cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate is in question. AHA concluded that ""many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat"". Other studies found that soy protein consumption could lower LDL. 
 Soybeans contain a high level of phytic acid, which has many effects including acting as an antioxidant and a chelating agent. The beneficial claims for phytic acid include reducing cancer, minimizing diabetes, and reducing inflammation. However, phytic acid is also criticized for reducing vital minerals absorption due to its chelating effect, especially for diets already low in minerals.","Endometrium,[bpoc],17.80,C0014180|Prostate,[bpoc],14.64,C0033572|Breast Carcinoma,[neop],12.94,C0678222|Uterus,[bpoc],12.90,C0042149|Eating,[orgf],12.88,C0013470|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],7.36,C0006826|Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract,[neop],5.18,C0685938|Malignant neoplasm of breast,[neop],3.47,C0006142|Disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0012634|Respiratory Tract Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0035243|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],7.29,C0007222|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.75,C0012159|Heart Diseases,[dsyn],6.65,C0018799|Breast Carcinoma,[neop],14.64,C0678222|Prostate,[bpoc],14.64,C0033572|Uterus,[bpoc],14.64,C0042149|Hot flushes,[sosy],10.11,C0600142|Malignant neoplasm of breast,[neop],5.18,C0006142|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.63,C0009830|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],14.64,C0011849|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.01,C2347023|Inflammation,[patf],9.99,C0021368|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.68,C0006826|"
"('fermented soybean', 'Health impact')","Allergy to soy is common, and the food is listed with other foods that commonly cause allergy, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. The problem has been reported among younger children, and the diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents and results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy. Only a few reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct challenge with the food under controlled conditions. It is very difficult to give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy allergy in the general population. To the extent that it does exist, soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria and angioedema, usually within minutes to hours of ingestion. In rare cases, true anaphylaxis may also occur. The reason for the discrepancy is likely that soy proteins, the causative factor in allergy, are far less potent at triggering allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish. An allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system has formed IgE antibodies to soy proteins. However, this is only a factor when soy proteins reach the blood without being digested, in sufficient quantities to reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms.
Soy can also trigger symptoms via food intolerance, a situation where no allergic mechanism can be proven. One scenario is seen in very young infants who have vomiting and diarrhoea when fed soy-based formula, which resolves when the formula is withdrawn. Older infants can suffer a more severe disorder with vomiting, diarrhoea that may be bloody, anemia, weight loss and failure to thrive. The most common cause of this unusual disorder is a sensitivity to cow's milk, but soy formulas can also be the trigger. The precise mechanism is unclear and it could be immunologic, although not through the IgE-type antibodies that have the leading role in urticaria and anaphylaxis. However, it is also self-limiting and will often disappear in the toddler years. 
 Soybeans contain isoflavones called genistein and daidzein, which are one source of phytoestrogens in the human diet. Because most naturally occurring phytoestrogens act as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, which do not necessarily act as direct agonists of estrogen receptors, normal consumption of foods that contain these phytoestrogens should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological response in humans.Plant lignans associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites. Soybeans are a significant source of mammalian lignan precursor secoisolariciresinol containing 13 273  g/100 g dry weight. Another phytoestrogen in the human diet with estrogen activity is coumestans, which are found in beans, split-peas, with the best sources being alfalfa, clover, and soybean sprouts. Coumestrol, an isoflavone coumarin derivative, is the only coumestan in foods.Soybeans and processed soy foods are among the richest foods in total phytoestrogens (wet basis per 100 g), which are present primarily in the form of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Human breast milk-containing or cow milk formula-containing diets provide 0.005-0.01 mg of isoflavone per day, while soy-based infant formulas provide  6 47 mg of isoflavone daily. This intake is several orders of magnitude greater than those provided by other nutrients. 
 Although considerable research has examined the potential for soy consumption to lower the risk of breast cancer in women, there is insufficient population evidence to make a conclusion about this relationship, as of 2016. A 2011 meta-analysis stated: ""Our study suggests soy isoflavones intake is associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer incidence in Asian populations, but not in Western populations."" 
 A 2016 review concluded that ""current evidence from observational studies and small clinical trials is not robust enough to understand whether soy protein or isoflavone supplements may help prevent or inhibit the progression of prostate cancer."" A 2010 review showed that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone or estrogen concentrations in men. Soy consumption has been shown to have no effect on the levels and quality of sperm. Meta-analyses on the association between soy consumption and prostate cancer risk in men concluded that dietary soy may lower the risk of prostate cancer. 
 According to the American Cancer Society, ""There is growing evidence that eating traditional soy foods such as tofu may lower the risk of cancers of the breast, prostate, or endometrium (lining of the uterus), and there is some evidence it may lower the risk of certain other cancers."" There is insufficient research to indicate whether taking soy dietary supplements has any effect on health or cancer risk.  Reviews of preliminary clinical trials on people with colorectal  or gastrointestinal cancer indicated a small lower risk by consuming soy isoflavones. 
 One review noted that soy based foods may inhibit absorption of thyroid hormone medications required for treatment of hypothyroidism. A 2015 scientific review by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that intake of isoflavones from supplements did not affect thyroid hormone levels in postmenopausal women. 
 Soybeans and soy products contain significant amounts of purines, a class of organic compounds. For people who suffer from gout, eating foods containing moderate or high levels of purines may make the condition worse. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends that gout sufferers limit consumption of soy products (although also suggesting that soy may have health benefits by reducing the risk for heart disease). Previous research found little or no association between consumption of purine-rich vegetables (including beans) and gout.","Allergic Reaction,[patf],87.46,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],87.46,C0020517|Angioedema,[patf],17.80,C0002994|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|In Blood,[bdsu],16.21,C0005768|Precipitating Factors,[clna],16.02,C0032930|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],13.14,C0002792|Urticaria,[dsyn],12.91,C0042109|Blood,[bdsu],9.90,C0005767|Disease,[dsyn],9.71,C0012634|Precipitating Factors,[clna],35.81,C0032930|Diarrhea,[sosy],29.46,C0011991|Vomiting,[sosy],26.55,C0042963|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Fish-Eye Disease,[dsyn],22.39,C0342895|Vision,[orgf],16.14,C0042789|In Blood,[bdsu],16.07,C0005768|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.05,C0026131|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],14.64,C0002792|Food intolerance (disorder),[dsyn],12.94,C0149696|Urticaria,[dsyn],12.89,C0042109|Failure to Thrive,[dsyn],11.49,C0015544|Anemia,[dsyn],9.99,C0002871|Blood,[bdsu],9.76,C0005767|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.71,C0020517|Milk, Human,[bdsu],39.30,C0026140|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],32.56,C0026131|Body Weight,[orga],22.52,C0005910|Diet therapy,[hlca],19.78,C0012159|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Desiccation,[npop],9.90,C0011682|Breast,[bpoc],6.79,C0006141|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|Breast Carcinoma,[neop],26.16,C0678222|Malignant neoplasm of breast,[neop],7.12,C0006142|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.43,C0009830|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Disease Progression,[patf],13.02,C0242656|sperm cell,[cell],12.91,C0037868|Mental association,[menp],12.89,C0004083|Malignant neoplasm of prostate,[neop],10.79,C0376358|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.40,C0009830|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Endometrium,[bpoc],17.80,C0014180|Prostate,[bpoc],14.64,C0033572|Breast Carcinoma,[neop],12.94,C0678222|Uterus,[bpoc],12.90,C0042149|Eating,[orgf],12.88,C0013470|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],7.36,C0006826|Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract,[neop],5.18,C0685938|Malignant neoplasm of breast,[neop],3.47,C0006142|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.02,C2347023|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Hypothyroidism,[dsyn],9.87,C0020676|Gout,[dsyn],49.53,C0018099|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Mental Suffering,[mobd],13.05,C0683278|Mental association,[menp],13.01,C0004083|Disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0012634|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.01,C0009830|Heart Diseases,[dsyn],6.62,C0018799|"

"('wax gourd', 'Uses')","The wax gourd requires very warm weather to grow but can be stored for many months much like winter squash. Ash gourds of the Indian subcontinent have a white coating with rough texture (hence the name ash gourd, literally, in some vernaculars). South East Asian varieties have a smooth waxy texture. It is one of the few vegetables available during winter in areas of deciduous vegetation, hence its Chinese name literally means 'winter gourd'. Wax gourds can typically be stored for 12 months. In India, the wax gourd is recognized for its medicinal properties in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. It is also has significance in spiritual traditions of India and Yoga, where it is identified as a great source of Prana.In Vietnamese cuisine, it is called b   ao, which is usually used to make soup or stew. When cooked with pork short ribs, the resulting soup is traditionally thought to help produce more milk for breastfeeding mothers.In Chinese cuisine the gourds are used in stir fries or usually combined with pork or pork/beef bones to make winter gourd soup, often served in the scooped out gourd, carved by scraping off the waxy coating. It is also chopped and candied as wintermelon candy (t ng d ng gu ) to be commonly eaten at New Year festivals, or as filling for Sweetheart cake (l op  b ng). It has also been used as the base filling in Chinese and Taiwanese mooncakes for the Moon Festival.
In the Philippines it is candied (referred to plainly as kundol) and is used as a pastry filling for bakpia (hopia in the Philippines).  It is also an ingredient in some savory soups (sabaw) and stir-fries (guisado).
In Indian cuisine this gourd is traditionally used to prepare a wide variety of dishes. In northern India it is used to prepare a candy called petha. In South Indian cuisine, it is traditionally used to make a variety of curries, including a stew made with a yogurt base. The juice of raw ash gourd (Maipawl) is used by the Mizo community of North-East India as a natural remedy to treat mild to severe dysentery. In north India, particularly in middle Himalayas, it is paired with pulses such as moong which when squashed along with winter gourd results in the making of a dish locally called bari. When dried in the cool winter sunlight it becomes somewhat hard and is used as a curry dish and eaten along with rice or chapati. This practice is done in Himalayas for quite a long time as people in mountains depend upon nature to help them survive harsh winters. This bari is a great source of iron and vitamins and eaten diversely in the mountains.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is called ""boodidi gummidikaya"" (Telugu language). It is used to make stews, stir fries and vadialu. Vadialu (plural; vadiam is singular) are made by chopping the gourd in small pieces and mixing with yogurt and spices, then sun-drying. To eat, vadiams are deep fried in oil and eaten as an accompaniment to rice and sambar (dish) or lentil stews. 
In Kerala, the plant is called Kumbalam (       ) and the fruit is called Kumbalanga (         ) or Kooshmandam (          ). It is traditionally used to offer 'Guruthi' (      ) instead of 'Kuruti' (      ) among Malayali Brahmins. It means, instead of offering someone's life in the pier, an ash gourd is cut into two as a symbolic performance in lieu human sacrifice.  
In the Gujarat, is called kolu (    ).
In Nepal, where it is called Kubhindo, it is cooked as a vegetable when young, but the ripe gourds are usually popular in making preserves or crystallized candied sweet known as ""murabba"" or ""petha"".Occasionally, it is used to produce a fruit drink with a very distinctive taste. It is usually sweetened with caramelized sugar. In Southeast Asia, the drink is widely marketed as wax gourd tea or wax gourd punch.

Liquorice provided tobacco products with a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. As of 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of any ""characterizing flavors"" other than menthol from cigarettes, but not other manufactured tobacco products.

In most of these candies, the taste is reinforced by aniseed oil so the actual content of liquorice is very low. Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in Europe, but are also popular in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.In the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (drop) is one of the most popular forms of sweets. It is sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is quite popular. Mixing it with ammonium chloride (salmiak) is also popular. A popular example of salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as zoute drop (salty liquorice), but contains very little salt, i.e., sodium chloride. Strong, salty sweets are also popular in Nordic countries.
Dried sticks of the liquorice root are also a traditional confectionery in their own right in the Netherlands, although their popularity has quickly waned in recent decades. They were sold simply as sticks of zoethout ('sweet wood') to chew on as a candy. Through chewing and suckling, the intensely sweet flavour is released. The sweetness is 30 to 50 times as strong as sucrose, without causing damage to teeth. Since about the 1970s, zoethout has become rarer and been replaced by easier to consume candies (including 'drop').
Pontefract in Yorkshire, England, was the first place where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the same way it is today.  Pontefract cakes were originally made there. In County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as 'Spanish', supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at Rievaulx Abbey near Thirsk.In Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, liquorice is popular in its natural form. The root of the plant is simply dug up, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, unsweetened liquorice is consumed in the form of small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract. In Calabria a popular liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract.

Other jurisdictions have suggested no more than 100 mg to 200 mg of glycyrrhizin per day, the equivalent of about 70 to 150 g (2.5 to 5.3 oz) of liquorice confectionery. Liquorice should not be used during pregnancy.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],124.60,C0682897|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|Oral Tobacco,[sbst],17.80,C0008038|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.94,C0682897|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|Taste Perception,[ortf],14.64,C0039336|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Chewing,[orgf],33.00,C0024888|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.75,C0030685|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.40,C0682897|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.04,C0040452|Wood material,[sbst],14.64,C0043217|Tooth structure,[bpoc],12.89,C0040426|Chewing,[orgf],16.18,C0024888|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.18,C0040452|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.29,C0682897|Hepatitis C,[dsyn],16.22,C0019196|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Psoriasis,[dsyn],12.90,C0033860|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.29,C0682897|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Weight Gain,[fndg],24.11,C0043094|Sunlight,[npop],19.45,C0038817|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.29,C0682897|Hypokalemia,[fndg],14.64,C0020621|Pregnancy,[orgf],13.05,C0032961|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Edema,[sosy],11.49,C0013604|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0020538|Catabolism,[orgf],3.57,C0699900|degradation aspects,[orgf],3.57,C0243125|"
"('liquorice', 'Liquorice poisoning')","Liquorice is an extract from the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant which contains glycyrrhizic acid, or GZA. GZA is made of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid.
The extracts from the root of the plant can also be referred to as liquorice, sweet root, and glycyrrhiza extract. G. glabra grows in subtropical climates in Europe, the Middle East, and Western Asia. When administered orally, the product of glycyrrhetic acid is found in human urine whereas GZA is not. This shows that glycyrrhetic acid is absorbed and metabolized in the intestines in humans. GZA is hydrolyzed to glycyrrhetic acid in the intestines by bacteria.For thousands of years G. glabra has been used for medicinal purposes including indigestion and stomach inflammation. Some other medicinal purposes are cough suppression, ulcer treatment, and use as a laxative. Also, salts of GZA can be used in many products as sweeteners and aromatizers. The major use of liquorice goes towards the tobacco industry, at roughly 90% of usage. The rest is split evenly between food and pharmaceutics, at 5% of usage each (Federal Register, 1983). Liquorice extract is often found in sweets and many candies, some drugs, and beverages like root beer. It can also be used in chewing gum, tobacco products like snuff, and toothpaste.
An increase in intake of liquorice can cause many toxic effects. Hyper-mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can occur when the body retains sodium, loses potassium altering biochemical and hormonal activities. Some of these activities include lower aldosterone level, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis.Some other symptoms of toxicity include electrolyte imbalance, edema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Individuals will experience certain symptoms based on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, renal failure, and paralysis.Many adverse effects of liquorice poisoning can be seen and most are attributed to the mineralocorticoid effects of GZA. Depending on the dose and intake of liquorice, serious problems and even hospitalization can occur. People with previously existing heart or kidney problems may be more susceptible to GZA and liquorice poisoning. It is important to monitor the amount of liquorice consumed in order to prevent toxicity. It is difficult to determine a safe level, due to many varying factors from person to person. In the most sensitive individuals, daily intake of about 100 mg GZA can cause problems. This is equivalent to 50 g liquorice sweets. However, in most people, they can consume up to 400 mg before experiencing symptoms, which would be about 200 g liquorice sweets. A rule of thumb is that a normal healthy person can consume 10 mg GZA a day.","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],49.09,C0040452|Intestines,[bpoc],19.86,C0021853|Climate,[npop],16.18,C0008946|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Dyspepsia,[sosy],14.64,C0013395|Gastritis,[dsyn],14.64,C0017152|Urine,[bdsu],9.88,C0042036|Ulcer,[patf],9.81,C0041582|Weight Gain,[fndg],24.11,C0043094|Kidney Failure,[dsyn],17.80,C0035078|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Dyspnea,[sosy],14.64,C0013404|Paralysed,[fndg],14.64,C0522224|Heart,[bpoc],13.71,C0018787|Poisoning,[inpo],13.44,C0032343|Hospitalization,[hlca],13.14,C0019993|Syndrome,[dsyn],13.09,C0039082|Edema,[sosy],11.49,C0013604|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0020538|Patient Monitoring,[hlca],11.49,C0030695|Kidney,[bpoc],9.81,C0022646|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.63,C0020517|"
"('dried ginger', 'Uses')","Ginger is a very popular spice used worldwide; whether it be used to spice up meals, or as a medicine, the demand for ginger all over the world has been consistent throughout history. Ginger is a fragrant kitchen spice. Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can be steeped in boiling water to make ginger herb tea, to which honey may be added. Ginger can be made into candy or ginger wine.
Mature ginger rhizomes are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.
Fresh ginger can be substituted for ground ginger at a ratio of six to one, although the flavors of fresh and dried ginger are somewhat different. Powdered dry ginger root is typically used as a flavoring for recipes such as gingerbread, cookies, crackers and cakes, ginger ale, and ginger beer. Candied ginger or crystallized ginger, known in the U.K. as ""stem ginger"", is the root cooked in sugar until soft, and is a type of confectionery. Fresh ginger may be peeled before eating. For longer-term storage, the ginger can be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated or frozen.In Indian cuisine, ginger is a key ingredient, especially in thicker gravies, as well as in many other dishes, both vegetarian and meat-based. Ginger has a role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient in traditional Indian drinks, both cold and hot, including spiced masala chai. Fresh ginger is one of the main spices used for making pulse and lentil curries and other vegetable preparations. Fresh ginger together with peeled garlic cloves is crushed or ground to form ginger garlic masala. Fresh, as well as dried, ginger is used to spice tea and coffee, especially in winter. In south India, ""sambharam"" is a summer yogurt drink made with ginger as a key ingredient, along with green chillies, salt and curry leaves. Ginger powder is used in food preparations intended primarily for pregnant or nursing women, the most popular one being katlu, which is a mixture of gum resin, ghee, nuts, and sugar. Ginger is also consumed in candied and pickled form. In Japan, ginger is pickled to make beni sh ga and gari or grated and used raw on tofu or noodles. It is made into a candy called shoga no sato zuke. In the traditional Korean kimchi, ginger is either finely minced or just juiced to avoid the fibrous texture and added to the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process. 
In Burma, ginger is called gyin. It is widely used in cooking and as a main ingredient in traditional medicines. It is  consumed as a salad dish called gyin-thot, which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, with a variety of nuts and seeds. In Thailand' where it is called     khing, it is used to make a ginger garlic paste in cooking. In Indonesia, a beverage called wedang jahe is made from ginger and palm sugar. Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called jahe, as a common ingredient in local recipes. In Malaysia, ginger is called halia and used in many kinds of dishes, especially soups. Called luya in the Philippines, ginger is a common ingredient in local dishes and is brewed as a tea called salabat. In Vietnam, the fresh leaves, finely chopped, can be added to shrimp-and-yam soup (canh khoai m ) as a top garnish and spice to add a much subtler flavor of ginger than the chopped root. In China, sliced or whole ginger root is often paired with savory dishes such as fish, and chopped ginger root is commonly paired with meat, when it is cooked. Candied ginger is sometimes a component of Chinese candy boxes, and a herbal tea can be prepared from ginger. Raw ginger juice can be used to set milk and make a desert, ginger milk curd.
In the Caribbean, ginger is a popular spice for cooking and for making drinks such as sorrel, a drink made during the Christmas season. Jamaicans make ginger beer both as a carbonated beverage and also fresh in their homes. Ginger tea is often made from fresh ginger, as well as the famous regional specialty Jamaican ginger cake. On the island of Corfu, Greece, a traditional drink called             (tsitsibira), a type of ginger beer, is made. The people of Corfu and the rest of the Ionian islands adopted the drink from the British, during the period of the United States of the Ionian Islands.
In Western cuisine, ginger is traditionally used mainly in sweet foods such as ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, parkin, and speculaas. A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Ginger wine is a ginger-flavored wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle. Ginger is also used as a spice added to hot coffee and tea.

"('kudzu root', 'Uses')","Kudzu has been used as a form of erosion control and to enhance the soil. As a legume, it increases the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it has been used for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation. 
 Kudzu can be used by grazing animals, as it is high in quality as a forage and palatable to livestock.  It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after.  Kudzu had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources.  Kudzu hay typically has a 15 18% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible nutrient value.  The quality of the leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to the leaf content.  Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually.  It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water.  This makes it necessary to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled.  Fresh kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, but frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin even established stands.  Thus, kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis. 
 Kudzu fiber has long been used for fiber art and basketry.  The long runners which propagate the kudzu fields and the larger vines which cover trees make excellent weaving material.  Some basketmakers use the material green.  Others use it after splitting it in half, allowing it to dry and then rehydrating it using hot water.  Both traditional and contemporary basketry artists use kudzu. 
 Kudzu contains isoflavones, including puerarin (about 60% of the total isoflavones), daidzein, daidzin (structurally related to genistein), mirificin, and salvianolic acid, among numerous others identified. In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as g  g n (gegen), kudzu is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs thought to have therapeutic effects, although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it has any activity or therapeutic use in humans. Adverse effects may occur if kudzu is taken by people with hormone-sensitive cancer or those taking tamoxifen, antidiabetic medications, or methotrexate. 
 The roots contain starch, which has traditionally been used as a food ingredient in East Asia. In Vietnam, the starch called b t s n d y is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in the summer. In Japan, the plant is known as kuzu and the starch named kuzuko. Kuzuko is used in dishes including kuzumochi, mizu manj , and kuzuyu. It also serves as a thickener for sauces, and can substitute for cornstarch.The flowers are used to make a jelly that tastes similar to grape jelly. Roots, flowers, and leaves of kudzu show antioxidant activity that suggests food uses. Nearby bee colonies may forage on kudzu nectar during droughts as a last resort, producing a low-viscosity red or purple honey that tastes of grape jelly or bubblegum. 
 Kudzu has also been used for centuries in East Asia to make herbal teas and tinctures. Kudzu powder is used in Japan to make an herbal tea called kuzuyu.  Kakkonto (   , Mandarin Chinese: g g nt ng, Japanese: kakkont ; literally, Kudzu Root Soup) is a herbal drink with its origin in traditional Chinese medicine. It is made from a mixture containing the main ingredient, dried kudzu roots, and sliced fresh ginger, cinnamon twigs, Chinese peony, licorice, jujubes, and ephedra. Together these plants are used to create a drink containing puerarin, daidzein, paenoflorin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, ephedrine and gingerol. 
 Kudzu fiber, known as ko-hemp, is used traditionally to make clothing and paper, and has also been investigated for industrial-scale use.It may become a valuable asset for the production of cellulosic ethanol.

Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations and metabolic effect in humans with CYP2A6 polymorphism. Based on this assessment, the European Union set a guideline for maximum coumarin content in foodstuffs of 50 mg per kg of dough in seasonal foods, and 15 mg per kg in everyday baked foods. According to the maximum recommended TDI of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight, which is 5 mg of coumarin for a body weight of 50 kg:

Due to the variable amount of coumarin in C. cassia, usually well over 1.0 mg of coumarin per g of cinnamon and sometimes up to 12 times that, C. cassia has a low safe intake level upper limit to adhere to the above TDI.

"('fleeceflower root', 'Uses')","Japanese knotweed flowers are valued by some beekeepers as an important source of nectar for honeybees, at a time of year when little else is flowering. Japanese knotweed yields a monofloral honey, usually called bamboo honey by northeastern U.S. beekeepers, like a mild-flavoured version of buckwheat honey (a related plant also in the Polygonaceae).
The young stems are edible as a spring vegetable, with a flavour similar to extremely sour rhubarb. In some locations, semi-cultivating Japanese knotweed for food has been used as a means of controlling knotweed populations that invade sensitive wetland areas and drive out the native vegetation. It is eaten in Japan as sansai or wild foraged vegetable.
It is used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine to treat various disorders through the actions of resveratrol, although there is no high-quality evidence from clinical research for any medical efficacy. Extracts of resveratrol from R. japonica roots are higher in content than those from stems or leaves, and have highest levels at the end of the growing season.Ground-feeding songbirds also eat the seeds.It grows widely throughout Japan and is foraged as a wild edible vegetable (sansai), though not in sufficient quantities to be included in statistics. They are called by such regional names as tonkiba (Yamagata), itazuiko (Nagano, Mie), itazura (Gifu, Toyama, Nara, Wakayama, Kagawa), gonpachi (Shizuoka, Nara, Mie, Wakayama), sashi (Akita, Yamagata), jajappo (Shimane, Tottori, Okayama), sukanpo (many areas).
Young leaves and shoots, which look like asparagus, are used. They are extremely sour; the fibrous outer skin must be peeled, soaked in water for half a day raw or after parboiling, before being cooked.
Places in Shikoku such as central parts of Kagawa Prefecture pickle the peeled young shoots by weighting them down in salt mixed with 10% nigari (magnesium chloride). People in Kochi also rub these cleaned shoots with coarse salt-nigari blend. It is said (though no authority is cited) that the magnesium of the nigari binds with the oxalic acid thus mitigating its hazard.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.19,C0682897|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.23,C0682897|Wetlands,[npop],16.09,C1721088|Eating,[orgf],13.02,C0013470|Natural Springs,[npop],12.85,C3179043|Intrinsic drive,[menp],11.49,C0013126|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.63,C0020517|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Disease,[dsyn],9.86,C0012634|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.51,C0599638|Fibrosis,[patf],9.78,C0016059|Body Weight,[orga],22.35,C0005910|"

"(' black sesame seed', 'Allergy')","Sesame seeds and sesame oil are serious allergens to some people, including infants. In Australia, the occurrence of allergy to sesame seed was estimated to be 0.42% among all children, while in the United Kingdom, the allergic reaction was found to affect 0.04% of adults. The occurrence of allergy to sesame in patients with some form of food allergy was found to be much higher than in the general population, ranging from 0.5% in Switzerland to 8.5% in Australia. In other words, allergy to sesame affects a small percentage of overall human population, but sesame allergy is high in people who already show symptoms of allergy to other foods.The symptoms of sesame seed allergy can be classified into:

Systemic reactions: Primarily presenting anaphylaxis characterized by symptoms including hives (urticaria), lip and eyelid swelling (angioedema ) sneezing, nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, wheezing, cough, tightness of throat, hoarse voice, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain, unconsciousness, shock with drop of blood pressure. In the systemic reactions can also be included severe reactions like dizziness, drowsiness, chills and collapse as has been reported in patients after ingestion of a falafel burger.
Other symptoms: Facial or generalized redness (""flushing""), hives (urticaria) on smaller or larger parts of the body, swelling of the eyelids,  lips or other parts of the face, itching of the eyes or of the skin in general, hay fever symptoms in the eyes and eczema. Respiratory symptoms observed include hay fever, asthma, cough, wheeze, or difficulty in breathing. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Itching in the mouth and/or tongue soon after chewing and ingesting (Oral allergy syndrome) and abdominal pain.Amounts as low as 100 mg of sesame seeds or flour and 3 ml of oil can trigger allergic reactions in severe cases of sesame-allergic individuals. Most patients, however, show allergic reactions after consuming 2 10 g of sesame seeds or flour. The onset of the symptoms may occur within a few minutes up to 90 minutes after ingestion of a sesame seed product. Most patients had other allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema, and most patients also had a relative with an allergic disease. More than two-thirds of the patients with sesame allergy also had allergic reactions to other foods.Prevalence of sesame allergy varies per country. While it is one of the three most common allergens in Israel, sesame allergy prevalence is considered small relative to other allergens in the United States. Some experts consider sesame allergies to have ""increased more than any other type of food allergy over the past 10 to 20 years"" in the United States. Such increasing prevalence led Canada to issue regulations that require food labels to note the presence of sesame.In addition to products derived from sesame such as tahini and sesame oil, persons with sesame allergies are warned to stay away from a broad assortment of processed foods, including baked goods, tempeh, and generic ""vegetable oil"".  In addition to possible food sources, individuals allergic to sesame have been warned that a variety of nonfood sources may also trigger a reaction to sesame, including adhesive bandages, cosmetics, hair-care products, perfumes, soaps and sunscreens, drugs, some fungicides and insecticides, lubricants, ointments and topical oils, and pet food.At least one study found that ""standard skin and blood testing for food allergies [does not] predict whether a child has true sesame allergy."" In which case, a food challenge under the direction of a physician may be required to properly diagnose a sesame allergy.
A cross-reactivity apparently exists between sesame allergens and peanut, rye, kiwifruit, poppy seed, and various tree nuts (such as hazelnut, black walnut, cashew, macadamia, and pistachio).","Allergic Reaction,[patf],52.00,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],52.00,C0020517|Affect (mental function),[menp],23.12,C0001721|Food Allergy,[patf],12.91,C0016470|Urticaria,[dsyn],29.46,C0042109|Unconscious State,[fndg],20.95,C0041657|Shock,[patf],20.15,C0036974|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Angioedema,[patf],17.80,C0002994|Hoarseness,[sosy],17.80,C0019825|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Eyelid structure,[bpoc],16.12,C0015426|Dizziness,[sosy],16.05,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],16.05,C0042571|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Wheezing,[sosy],14.64,C0043144|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],14.64,C0002792|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Pruritus,[fndg],13.09,C0033774|Nose,[bpoc],12.94,C0028429|Sneezing,[sosy],12.94,C0037383|Chills,[sosy],11.49,C0085593|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Edema,[sosy],9.99,C0013604|Hypotension,[fndg],9.78,C0020649|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],9.76,C0031354|Hypersensitivity,[patf],135.48,C0020517|Allergic Reaction,[patf],62.57,C1527304|Hay fever,[dsyn],59.76,C0018621|Food Allergy,[patf],39.53,C0016470|Precipitating Factors,[clna],35.81,C0032930|Asthma,[dsyn],32.61,C0004096|Eczema,[dsyn],29.46,C0013595|Urticaria,[dsyn],29.46,C0042109|Pruritus,[fndg],26.21,C0033774|Eye,[bpoc],26.05,C0015392|Sunscreening Agents,[sbst],20.95,C0038818|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Eyelid structure,[bpoc],16.18,C0015426|Chewing,[orgf],16.05,C0024888|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Flushing,[sosy],14.64,C0016382|Wheezing,[sosy],14.64,C0043144|Erythema,[dsyn],13.14,C0041834|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Syndrome,[dsyn],13.09,C0039082|Tongue,[bpoc],13.03,C0040408|Lubricants,[sbst],11.49,C0282222|Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory,[sosy],11.49,C0037090|Edema,[sosy],9.88,C0013604|Hair,[bpoc],6.63,C0018494|Body part,[bpoc],3.60,C0229962|Cross Reactions,[moft],11.49,C0010357|"
"('safflower', 'Uses')","Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available. For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds.Safflower seed oil is flavorless and colorless, and nutritionally similar to sunflower oil. It is used mainly in cosmetics and as a cooking oil, in salad dressing, and for the production of margarine. INCI nomenclature is Carthamus tinctorius.
There are two types of safflower that produce different kinds of oil: one high in monounsaturated fatty acid (oleic acid) and the other high in polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic acid). Currently the predominant edible oil market is for the former, which is lower in saturated fats than olive oil. The latter is used in painting in the place of linseed oil, particularly with white paints, as it does not have the yellow tint which linseed oil possesses. 
 Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available. For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds.Safflower flowers are occasionally used in cooking as a cheaper substitute for saffron, sometimes referred to as ""bastard saffron"".The dried safflower petals are also used as a herbal tea variety. 
In coloring textiles, dried safflower flowers are used as a natural dye source for the orange-red pigment carthamin. Carthamin is also known, in the dye industry, as Carthamus Red or Natural Red 26.In Japan, dyers have mastered the technique of producing a bright red to orange-red dye (known as carthamin) from the dried florets of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). A bath solution of cold water is first prepared, to which is added the collected flowers. Steeping in cold water releases a yellow pigment (colorant) which, after straining, is discarded. After pressing and drying once again the red petals, the petals are re-hydrated again, at which time alkali made from straw-ash is added to release the red colorant. The batch is then kneaded with one's hands and strained. Vinegar is then added to the solution, and the colorant is soaked up by using strips of linen. The strips of linen (now red) are then placed in a separate container and alkali is added once more to release the red absorbed by the linen. The solution obtained is then poured into a separate container. An extract made from a type of plum causes the colorant to precipitate onto a piece of silk. The colorant at this stage has the consistency of fine, red mud. Color used as a dye can be diluted. 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb) of dried florets produces enough dye pigment to dye a small piece of fabric. The dye color is fixed in the fabric with a mordant. Darker shades are achieved by repeating the dyeing process several times, having the fabric dry, and redyed. 
 Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available. For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds.In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), dried petals of safflower are considered as a warm herbal medicine related to the Heart and Liver Meridians; the major characteristic of safflower is to improve blood circulation. Safflower is used in situations such as menstrual cramps, amenorrhea, poor blood circulation (of mothers) after child birth, bruise because of external injuries, bodily ""aggregates"" like lumps and tumors, etc. It is advised to avoid the use of safflower during pregnancy.

"('mistletoe', 'Toxicity')","Some mistletoe plants are toxic  though their effects are not usually fatal.  In certain parts of South Asia, they are frequently used as an external medicine.  The active substances are Phoratoxin (in Phoradendron) and Tyramine (in Viscum) and their effects include blurred vision, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Less commonly they cause cardiac problems; seizures, hypertension, and even cardiac arrest. Toxins are more concentrated in the leaves and berries of the plant, with teas prepared from the plant being particularly dangerous. While adults may suffer little effect, these are more pronounced in small children and in animals.There are 1500 species of mistletoe, varying widely in toxicity; the European mistletoe (Viscum Album) is more toxic than the American mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum), though concerns regarding toxicity are more prevalent in the US.Mistletoe has been used historically in medicine for its supposed value in treating arthritis, high blood pressure, epilepsy and infertility:  Conversely, it can cause vasoconstriction and bradycardia, and has been used as an illegal abortifacient
Mistletoe is currently used as a complementary medicine for the treatment of cancer (though its use is not approved by the FDA) and as a veterinary herbal medicine.","Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],23.12,C0020538|Vision,[orgf],16.30,C0042789|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],14.64,C0424320|Bradycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0428977|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Epilepsy,[dsyn],14.64,C0014544|Infertility,[patf],14.64,C0021359|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Vascular constriction (function),[ortf],14.64,C0042396|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.06,C0018790|Arthritis,[dsyn],9.73,C0003864|Heart,[bpoc],6.66,C0018787|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"
"('black pepper', 'Phytochemicals, folk medicine and research')","Like many eastern spices, pepper was historically both a seasoning and a folk medicine. Long pepper, being stronger, was often the preferred medication, but both were used. Black pepper (or perhaps long pepper) was believed to cure several illnesses, such as constipation, insomnia, oral abscesses, sunburn, and toothaches, among others. Various sources from the fifth century onward recommended pepper to treat eye problems, often by applying salves or poultices made with pepper directly to the eye. No current medical evidence indicates any of these treatments has any benefit.Pepper is known to cause sneezing. Some sources say that piperine, a substance present in black pepper, irritates the nostrils, causing the sneezing. Few, if any, controlled studies have been carried out to answer the question.
Piperine is under study for its potential to increase absorption of selenium, vitamin B12, beta-carotene and curcumin, as well as other compounds. As a folk medicine, pepper appears in the Buddhist Sama  aphala Sutta, chapter five, as one of the few medicines a monk is allowed to carry.
Pepper contains phytochemicals, including amides, piperidines, pyrrolidines and trace amounts of safrole, which may be carcinogenic in laboratory rodents.Piperine is also under study for a variety of possible physiological effects, although this work is preliminary and mechanisms of activity for piperine in the human body remain unknown.One tablespoon (6 grams) of ground black pepper contains moderate amounts of vitamin K (13% of the daily value or DV), iron (10% DV) and manganese (18% DV), with trace amounts of other essential nutrients, protein, and dietary fibre.","Sneezing,[sosy],29.46,C0037383|Eye,[bpoc],26.40,C0015392|Toothache,[sosy],20.95,C0040460|Sleeplessness,[sosy],17.80,C0917801|Abscess,[dsyn],16.26,C0000833|Constipation,[sosy],14.64,C0009806|Sunburn,[inpo],14.64,C0038814|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.05,C2347023|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Carcinogenesis,[neop],12.88,C0596263|"
"('fenugreek seed', 'Uses')","Fenugreek is used as a herb (dried or fresh leaves), spice (seeds), and vegetable (fresh leaves, sprouts, and microgreens). Sotolon is the chemical responsible for the distinctive maple syrup smell of fenugreek.Cuboid-shaped, yellow- to amber-coloured fenugreek seeds are frequently encountered in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, used both whole and powdered in the preparation of pickles, vegetable dishes, dal, and spice mixes such as panch phoron and sambar powder. They are often roasted to reduce bitterness and enhance flavour.Fresh fenugreek leaves are an ingredient in some curries, such as with potatoes in cuisines of the Indian subcontinent to make ""aloo methi"" (""potato fenugreek"") curry. Sprouted seeds and fenugreek greens are used in salads. When harvested as greens, fenugreek is known as samudra methi in Maharashtra, especially in and around Mumbai, where it is often grown in sandy tracts near the sea, hence the name samudra, ""ocean"" in Sanskrit. Samudra methi is also grown in dry river beds in the Gangetic plains. When sold as a vegetable, the young plants are harvested with their roots still attached and sold in small bundles in the markets and bazaars. Any remaining soil is washed off to extend their shelf life.
In Turkish cuisine, fenugreek seeds are used for making a paste known as  emen. Cumin, black pepper, and other spices are added into it, especially to make past rma.  
In Iranian cuisine, fenugreek leaves are called shanbalileh. They are one of several greens incorporated into the herb stew ghormeh sabzi, the herb frittata kuku sabzi and a soup known as eshkeneh. 
In Georgian cuisine, a related species Trigonella caerulea called ""blue fenugreek"" is used.  
In Egyptian cuisine, peasants in Upper Egypt add fenugreek seeds and maize to their pita bread to produce aish merahrah, a staple of their diet. Fenugreek is used in Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine. The word for fenugreek in Amharic is abesh (or abish), and the seed is used in Ethiopia as a natural herbal medicine in the treatment of diabetes.Yemenite Jews following the interpretation of Rabbi Shelomo Yitzchak (Rashi) believe fenugreek, which they call hilbeh, hilba, helba, or halba ""     "", to be the Talmudic rubia ""     "". When the seed kernels are ground and mixed with water they greatly expand; hot spices, turmeric and lemon juice are added to produce a frothy relish eaten with a sop. The relish is also called hilbeh; it is reminiscent of curry. It is eaten daily and ceremonially during the meal of the first and/or second night of the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana.

Fenugreek may affect uterine contractions and may be unsafe for women with hormone-sensitive cancers.Fenugreek sprouts, cultivated from a single specific batch of seeds imported from Egypt into Germany in 2009, were implicated as the source of the 2011 outbreak of Escherichia coli O104:H4 in Germany and France. Identification of a common producer and a single batch of fenugreek seeds supports the epidemiologic evidence implicating them as the source of the outbreaks.Some people are allergic to fenugreek, including those with peanut allergies or chickpea allergies. Fenugreek seeds can cause diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal distention, flatulence, perspiration, and a maple-like smell to urine or breast milk. There is a risk of hypoglycemia particularly in people with diabetes; it may also interfere with the activity of anti-diabetic drugs. Because of the high content of coumarin-like compounds in fenugreek, it may interfere with the activity and dosing of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs.

"('coriander', 'Uses')","All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking, Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.The leaves are variously referred to as coriander leaves, fresh coriander, dhania, Chinese parsley, or (in the US and commercially in Canada) cilantro.
Coriander potentially may be confused with culantro (Eryngium foetidum L.), an Apiaceae like coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.), but from a different genus. Culantro has a distinctly different spiny appearance, a more potent volatile leaf oil and a stronger aroma.
The leaves have a different taste from the seeds, with citrus overtones.The fresh leaves are an ingredient in many South Asian foods (such as chutneys and salads); in Chinese, Thai, and Burmese dishes; in Mexican cooking, particularly in salsa and guacamole and as a garnish; and in salads in Russia and other CIS countries. In Portugal, chopped coriander is used in the bread soup A orda, and in India, chopped coriander is a garnish on Indian dishes such as dal. As heat diminishes their flavour, coriander leaves are often used raw or added to the dish immediately before serving. In Indian and Central Asian recipes, coriander leaves are used in large amounts and cooked until the flavour diminishes. The leaves spoil quickly when removed from the plant, and lose their aroma when dried or frozen. 
 All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking, Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.The dry fruits are known as coriander seeds. The word ""coriander"" in food preparation may refer solely to these seeds (as a spice), rather than to the plant. The seeds have a lemony citrus flavour when crushed, due to terpenes linalool and pinene. It is described as warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured.
The variety C. s. vulgare has a fruit diameter of 3 5 mm (0.12 0.20 in), while var. C. s. microcarpum fruits have a diameter of 1.5 3 mm (0.06 0.12 in). Large-fruited types are grown mainly by tropical and subtropical countries, e.g. Morocco, India, and Australia, and contain a low volatile oil content (0.1-0.4%). They are used extensively for grinding and blending purposes in the spice trade. Types with smaller fruit are produced in temperate regions and usually have a volatile oil content around 0.4-1.8%, so are highly valued as a raw material for the preparation of essential oil.Coriander is commonly found both as whole dried seeds and in ground form. Roasting or heating the seeds in a dry pan heightens the flavour, aroma, and pungency. Ground coriander seed loses flavour quickly in storage and is best ground fresh. Coriander seed is a spice in garam masala and Indian curries which often employ the ground fruits in generous amounts together with cumin, acting as a thickener in a mixture called dhana jeera. Roasted coriander seeds, called dhana dal, are eaten as a snack. They are the main ingredient of the two south Indian dishes sambhar and rasam.
Outside of Asia, coriander seed is used widely in the process for pickling vegetables. In Germany and South Africa (see boerewors), the seeds are used while making sausages. In Russia and Central Europe, coriander seed is an occasional ingredient in rye bread (e.g. Borodinsky bread), as an alternative to caraway. The Zuni people of North America have adapted it into their cuisine, mixing the powdered seeds ground with chili and using it as a condiment with meat, and eating leaves as a salad.Coriander seeds are used in brewing certain styles of beer, particularly some Belgian wheat beers. The coriander seeds are used with orange peel to add a citrus character. Coriander seed is one of the main traditional ingredients in the South African Boerewors, a spiced mixed-meat sausage.
One preliminary study showed coriander essential oil to inhibit Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.Coriander is listed as one of the original ingredients in the secret formula for Coca-Cola. 
 All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds are the parts most traditionally used in cooking, Coriander is used in cuisines throughout the world.Coriander roots have a deeper, more intense flavor than the leaves, and are used in a variety of Asian cuisines, especially in Thai dishes such as soups or curry pastes.","Confusion,[mobd],16.21,C0009676|Vertebral column,[bpoc],12.88,C0037949|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.68,C2987717|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.18,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.21,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],17.80,C0016701|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.01,C0039336|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Heat (physical force),[npop],5.18,C0018837|flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.08,C0682897|Desiccation,[npop],9.81,C0011682|Crushing injury,[inpo],8.34,C0332679|flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.21,C0682897|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.02,C0020498|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|Temperance,[inbe],6.66,C0039475|Fragrance (odor),[npop],5.18,C2987717|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Personality Character,[menp],9.99,C0007952|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],10.18,C0018790|Staphylococcus aureus infection,[dsyn],5.18,C1318973|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.31,C0682897|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.15,C0020498|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.67,C0162425|Paste substance,[sbst],3.68,C0030634|"

"('sichuan pepper', 'Culinary uses')","Sichuan pepper's unique aroma and flavour is not hot or pungent like black, white, or chili peppers. Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth (caused by its 3% of hydroxy alpha sanshool) that sets the stage for hot spices. According to Harold McGee in On Food and Cooking, they are not simply pungent; ""they produce a strange, tingling, buzzing, numbing sensation that is something like the effect of carbonated drinks or of a mild electric current (touching the terminals of a nine-volt battery to the tongue). Sanshools appear to act on several different kinds of nerve endings at once, induce sensitivity to touch and cold in nerves that are ordinarily nonsensitive, and so perhaps cause a kind of general neurological confusion.""Recipes often suggest lightly toasting the tiny seed pods, then crushing them before adding them to food. Only the husks are used; the shiny black seeds are discarded or ignored as they have a very gritty, sand-like texture. The spice is generally added at the last moment. Star anise and ginger are often used with it in spicy Sichuan cuisine. It has an alkaline pH and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses. Ma la sauce (Chinese:   ; pinyin: m l ; literally ""numbing and spicy""), common in Sichuan cooking, is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper, and it is a key ingredient in m  l  hot pot, the Sichuan version of the traditional Chinese dish. It is also a common flavouring in Sichuan baked goods such as sweetened cakes and biscuits. Beijing microbrewery Great Leap Brewing uses Sichuan peppercorns, offset by honey, as a flavouring adjunct in its Honey Ma Blonde.Sichuan pepper is also available as an oil (Chinese:    , marketed as either ""Sichuan pepper oil"", ""Bunge prickly ash oil"", or ""huajiao oil""). In this form, it is best used in stir-fry noodle dishes without hot spices. The recipe may include ginger oil and brown sugar cooked with a base of noodles and vegetables, then adding rice vinegar and Sichuan pepper oil after cooking.Hua jiao yan (simplified Chinese:    ; traditional Chinese:    ; pinyin: hu ji oy n) is a mixture of salt and Sichuan pepper, toasted and browned in a wok, and served as a condiment to accompany chicken, duck, and pork dishes. The peppercorns can also be lightly fried to make a spicy oil with various uses.
In Indonesian Batak cuisine, andaliman (a relative of Sichuan pepper, Z. acanthopodium) is ground and mixed with chilies and seasonings into a green sambal tinombur or chili paste, to accompany grilled pork, carp, and other regional specialties. Arsik, a Batak dish from the Tapanuli region, uses andaliman as spice.
Sichuan pepper is one of the few spices important for Nepali, Northeast Indian, Tibetan, and Bhutanese cookery of the Himalayas because few spices can be grown there. One Himalayan specialty is the momo, a dumpling stuffed with vegetables, cottage cheese, or minced yak meat, water buffalo meat, or pork and flavoured with Sichuan pepper, garlic, ginger, and onion, served with tomato and Sichuan pepper-based gravy.

"('talc', 'Uses')","Talc is used in many industries, including paper making, plastic, paint and coatings, rubber, food, electric cable, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and ceramics. A coarse grayish-green high-talc rock is soapstone or steatite, used for stoves, sinks, electrical switchboards, etc. It is often used for surfaces of laboratory table tops and electrical switchboards because of its resistance to heat, electricity and acids. In finely ground form, talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture. It is used to coat the insides of inner tubes and rubber gloves during manufacture to keep the surfaces from sticking. Talcum powder, with heavy refinement, has been used in baby powder, an astringent powder used to prevent diaper rash. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents not use baby powder because it poses a risk of respiratory problems, including breathing trouble and serious lung damage if the baby inhales it. The small size of the particles makes it difficult to keep them out of the air while applying the powder. Zinc oxide-based ointments are a much safer alternative.It is also often used in basketball to keep a player's hands dry. Most tailor's chalk, or French chalk, is talc, as is the chalk often used for welding or metalworking.
Talc is also used as food additive or in pharmaceutical products as a glidant. In medicine, talc is used as a pleurodesis agent to prevent recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax. In the European Union, the additive number is E553b. 
Talc may be used in the processing of white rice as a buffing agent in the polishing stage.
Due to its low shear strength, talc is one of the oldest known solid lubricants. Also a limited use of talc as friction-reducing additive in lubricating oils is made.Talc is widely used in the ceramics industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire art-ware bodies, it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In stonewares, small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It is a source of MgO flux in high-temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a matting agent in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.
ISO standard for quality (ISO 3262)

Patents are pending on the use of magnesium silicate as a cement substitute. Its production requirements are less energy-intensive than ordinary Portland cement (at a heating requirement of around 650  C for talc compared to 1500  C for limestone to produce Portland cement), while it absorbs far more carbon dioxide as it hardens. This results in a negative carbon footprint overall, as the cement substitute removes 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per tonne used. This contrasts with a positive carbon footprint of 0.4 tonne per tonne of conventional cement.Talc is used in the production of the materials that are widely used in the building interiors such as base content paints in wall coatings. Other areas that use talc to a great extent are organic agriculture, food industry, cosmetics, and hygiene products such as baby powder and detergent powder.
Talc is sometimes used as an adulterant to illegal heroin, to expand volume and weight and thereby increase its street value. With intravenous use, it may lead to pulmonary talcosis, a granulomatous inflammation in the lungs.Sterile talc powder (NDC 63256-200-05) is a sclerosing agent used in the procedure of pleurodesis. This can be helpful as a cancer treatment to prevent pleural effusions (an abnormal collection of fluid in the space between the lungs and the thoracic wall). It is inserted into the space via a chest tube, causing it to close up, so fluid cannot collect there. The finished product has been sterilized by gamma irradiation.","Electricity,[npop],39.80,C0013790|Inspiration function,[orgf],32.74,C0004048|Diaper Rash,[dsyn],20.95,C0011974|Plastics,[sbst],17.80,C0032167|Air (substance),[sbst],16.18,C0001861|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Lubricants,[sbst],11.49,C0282222|Lung,[bpoc],6.79,C0024109|Heat (physical force),[npop],5.18,C0018837|electrical resistance,[npop],3.45,C0162535|Recurrence (disease attribute),[patf],12.89,C2825055|Pneumothorax,[dsyn],11.49,C0032326|Pleural effusion disorder,[dsyn],10.06,C0032227|Fever,[sosy],26.04,C0015967|Body Temperature,[orga],16.30,C0005903|Melting,[npop],16.30,C0599882|Vitrification,[npop],11.49,C2936610|Shear Strength,[npop],10.06,C1135950|Fire - disasters,[phpr],9.77,C0016141|Friction,[npop],9.73,C0162691|Lubricants,[sbst],9.73,C0282222|Dental Cementum,[bdsu],66.40,C0011343|Sclerosis,[patf],10.18,C0036429|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.78,C0162425|Body Weight,[orga],24.11,C0005910|Gamma Rays,[npop],16.18,C0017011|Chest wall structure,[bpoc],14.64,C0205076|Body Fluids,[bdsu],13.58,C0005889|Lung,[bpoc],13.36,C0024109|Granuloma,[patf],12.95,C0018188|Infertility,[patf],12.94,C0021359|Pleural effusion disorder,[dsyn],11.49,C0032227|Pneumonia,[dsyn],9.89,C0032285|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"
"('talc', 'Safety')","Talc powder is a household item, sold globally for use in personal hygiene and cosmetics. Suspicions have been raised that its use contributes to certain types of disease, mainly cancers of the ovaries and lungs. It is classified as a group 3 agent in the IARC listing. Reviews by Cancer Research UK and the American Cancer Society conclude that some studies have found a link, but other studies have not.The studies discuss pulmonary issues, lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. One of these, published in 1993, was a US National Toxicology Program report, which found that cosmetic grade talc containing no asbestos-like fibres was correlated with tumor formation in rats forced to inhale talc for 6 hours a day, five days a week over at least 113 weeks. A 1971 paper found particles of talc embedded in 75% of the ovarian tumors studied.
Research published in 1995 and 2000 concluded that it was plausible that talc could cause ovarian cancer, but no conclusive evidence was shown. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded in 2015 that talc, in the concentrations currently used in cosmetics, is safe.In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set occupational exposure limits to respirable talc dusts at 2 mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. At levels of 1000 mg/m3, inhalation of talc is considered immediately dangerous to life and health.

The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded in 2015 that talc, in the concentrations currently used in cosmetics, is safe.One particular issue with commercial use of talc is its frequent co-location in underground deposits with asbestos ore. Asbestos is a general term for different types of fibrous silicate minerals, desirable in construction for their heat resistant properties. There are six varieties of asbestos; the most common variety in manufacturing, white asbestos, is in the serpentine family. Serpentine minerals are sheet silicates; although not in the serpentine family, talc is also a sheet silicate, with two sheets connected by magnesium cations. The frequent co-location of talc deposits with asbestos may result in contamination of mined talc with white asbestos, which poses serious health risks when dispersed into the air and inhaled. Stringent quality control since 1976, including separating cosmetic- and food-grade talc from ""industrial""-grade talc, has largely eliminated this issue, but it remains a potential hazard requiring mitigation in the mining and processing of talc. A 2010 US FDA survey failed to find asbestos in a variety of talc-containing products. A 2018 Reuters investigation has asserted that pharmaceuticals company Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that there was asbestos in its baby powder.","Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|ovarian neoplasm,[neop],19.39,C0919267|Inspiration function,[orgf],17.80,C0004048|Lung,[bpoc],13.71,C0024109|Fibrosis,[patf],10.10,C0016059|Disease,[dsyn],9.86,C0012634|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],7.92,C1140680|Malignant neoplasm of lung,[neop],5.18,C0242379|Neoplasms,[neop],3.57,C0027651|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|Inspiration function,[orgf],16.21,C0004048|Occupational Exposure,[inpo],16.19,C0028798|Set (Psychology),[menp],12.89,C0036849|Dust,[sbst],11.49,C0013330|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],5.18,C1140680|Mental concentration,[menp],5.18,C0086045|Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|ovarian neoplasm,[neop],19.39,C0919267|Inspiration function,[orgf],17.80,C0004048|Lung,[bpoc],13.71,C0024109|Fibrosis,[patf],10.10,C0016059|Disease,[dsyn],9.86,C0012634|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],7.92,C1140680|Malignant neoplasm of lung,[neop],5.18,C0242379|Neoplasms,[neop],3.57,C0027651|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|Mental concentration,[menp],7.23,C0086045|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],5.18,C1140680|Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|ovarian neoplasm,[neop],19.39,C0919267|Inspiration function,[orgf],17.80,C0004048|Lung,[bpoc],13.71,C0024109|Fibrosis,[patf],10.10,C0016059|Disease,[dsyn],9.86,C0012634|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],7.92,C1140680|Malignant neoplasm of lung,[neop],5.18,C0242379|Neoplasms,[neop],3.57,C0027651|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|Epithelial ovarian cancer,[neop],24.11,C0677886|Term Birth,[orgf],19.31,C0233324|Inspiration function,[orgf],17.80,C0004048|Air (substance),[sbst],16.18,C0001861|Malignant neoplasm of ovary,[neop],5.18,C1140680|Mental concentration,[menp],5.18,C0086045|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.48,C0018837|"

They are also fried with sugar and honey to make sweet snacks. The starchy rhizomes can be dried, ground, and added to flour to supplement food staples. The rhizome of P. sibiricum is pulped, boiled, strained, and thickened with barley flour to make a sweet liquid seasoning agent called tangxi. At times, people in China have relied on P. megaphyllum as a famine food.The shoots of some Polygonatum can be boiled and used like asparagus. P. cirrifolium and P. verticillatum are used as leafy vegetables in India. The American species P. biflorum has a starchy root that was eaten like the potato and used as flour for bread.P. sibirica is used for a tea called dungulle in Korea. 
 The traditional use of Polygonatum in the treatment of diabetes was first observed in 1930 by Hedwig Langecker. After experiments, she concluded that it was effective in fighting nutritional hyperglycemia, though not that caused by adrenaline release, probably due to its glucokinin content.P. verticillatum is used in Ayurveda as an aphrodisiac. It is also used to treat pain, fever, inflammation, allergy, and weakness.An herbal remedy called rhizoma polygonati is a mix of Polygonatum species used in traditional Chinese medicine.

 Extracts of astragalus root include diverse phytochemicals, such as saponins and isoflavone flavonoids, which are purported in traditional practices to increase lactation in nursing mothers. There is no valid clinical evidence to indicate such use is effective or safe for the mother or infant. Dietary supplement products containing astragalus extracts may not have been adequately tested for efficacy, safety, purity or consistency. The root extracts of astragalus may be used in soups, teas or sold in capsules. 
 Although astragalus supplements are generally well tolerated, mild gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions may occur. Because astragalus may affect regulation of blood sugar and blood pressure, it may be risky for people with blood disorders, diabetes, or hypertension to use it as a supplement. Astragalus may interact with prescribed drugs that suppress the immune system, such as medications used by people being treated for cancer or recovery from organ transplants.Some astragalus species can be toxic, such as those found in the United States containing the neurotoxin, swainsonine, which causes ""locoweed"" poisoning in animals.

"('hemp seed', 'Uses')","Hemp is used to make a variety of commercial and industrial products, including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel. The bast fibers can be used to make textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other fibers, such as flax, cotton or silk, as well as virgin and recycled polyester, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are woodier and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding, and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as ""drying""), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.Hemp seeds can be eaten raw, ground into hemp meal, sprouted or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk and tisanes. Hemp oil is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids. The leaves of the hemp plant, while not as nutritional as the seeds, are edible and can be consumed raw as leafy vegetables in salads, and pressed to make juice.In 2011, the U.S. imported $11.5 million worth of hemp products, mostly driven by growth in the demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola.In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs treats hemp as a purely non-food crop, but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.2% THC concentration, hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient. In the U.S., imported hemp can be used legally in food products and, as of 2000, was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order.A 100-gram portion of hulled hemp seeds supplies 586 calories.  They contain 5% water, 5% carbohydrates, 49% total fat, and 31% protein. Hemp seeds are notable in providing 64% of the Daily Value (DV) of protein per 100-gram serving. Hemp seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber (20% DV), B vitamins, and the dietary minerals manganese (362% DV), phosphorus (236% DV), magnesium (197% DV), zinc (104% DV), and iron (61% DV). About 73% of the energy in hempseed is in the form of fats and essential fatty acids, mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic, oleic, and alpha-linolenic acids.Hempseed's amino acid profile is comparable to other sources of protein such as meat, milk, eggs and soy. Protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scores (PDCAAS), which attempt to measure the degree to which a food for humans is a ""complete protein"", were 0.49 0.53 for whole hemp seed, 0.46 0.51 for hempseed meal, and 0.63 0.66 for hulled hempseed.

The bast fibers can be used to make textiles that are 100% hemp, but they are commonly blended with other fibers, such as flax, cotton or silk, as well as virgin and recycled polyester, to make woven fabrics for apparel and furnishings. The inner two fibers of the plant are woodier and typically have industrial applications, such as mulch, animal bedding, and litter. When oxidized (often erroneously referred to as ""drying""), hemp oil from the seeds becomes solid and can be used in the manufacture of oil-based paints, in creams as a moisturizing agent, for cooking, and in plastics. Hemp seeds have been used in bird feed mix as well. A survey in 2003 showed that more than 95% of hemp seed sold in the European Union was used in animal and bird feed.Hemp seeds can be eaten raw, ground into hemp meal, sprouted or made into dried sprout powder. Hemp seeds can also be made into a liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk and tisanes. Hemp oil is cold-pressed from the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids. The leaves of the hemp plant, while not as nutritional as the seeds, are edible and can be consumed raw as leafy vegetables in salads, and pressed to make juice.In 2011, the U.S. imported $11.5 million worth of hemp products, mostly driven by growth in the demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola.In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs treats hemp as a purely non-food crop, but with proper licensing and proof of less than 0.2% THC concentration, hemp seeds can be imported for sowing or for sale as a food or food ingredient. In the U.S., imported hemp can be used legally in food products and, as of 2000, was typically sold in health food stores or through mail order.Hemp oil oxidizes and turns rancid within a short period of time if not stored properly;  its shelf life is extended when it is stored in a dark airtight container and refrigerated. Both light and heat can degrade hemp oil.

For centuries, items ranging from rope, to fabrics, to industrial materials were made from hemp fiber. Hemp was also commonly used to make sail canvas. The word ""canvas"" is derived from the word cannabis. Pure hemp has a texture similar to linen. Because of its versatility for use in a variety of products, today hemp is used in a number of consumer goods, including clothing, shoes, accessories, dog collars, and home wares. For clothing, in some instances, hemp is mixed with lyocell.

Such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements; they must be supported by a brick, wood, or steel frame. However, hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable, and have been shown to be usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs, including creating very durable and breathable homes. The most common use of hemp lime in building is by casting the hemp and lime mix while wet around a timber frame with temporary shuttering, and tamping the mix to form a firm mass; after the removal of the temporary shuttering, the solidified hemp mix is then ready to be plastered with a lime plaster.The first example of the use of hempcrete was in 1986 in France with the renovation of the Maison de la Turquie in Nogent-sur-Seine by the innovator Charles Rasetti. In the UK hemp lime was first used in 2000 for the construction of two test dwellings in Haverhill. Designed by Modece Architects, who pioneered hemp's use in UK construction, the hemp houses were monitored in comparison with other standard dwellings by BRE. Completed in 2009, the Renewable House is one of the most technologically advanced made from hemp-based materials. The first US home made of hemp-based materials was completed in August 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina.A panellized system of hemp-lime panels for use in building construction is currently under test in a European Union-funded research collaboration led by the University of Bath. The panels are being designed to assure high-quality construction, rapid on-site erection, optimal hygrothermal performance from day one, and energy- and resource-efficient buildings. The 36-month work program aims to refine product and manufacturing protocols and produce data for certification and marketing, warranty, insurance cover, and availability of finance. It also includes the development of markets in Britain, France, and Spain.Hemp is used as an internal plaster and is a mixture of hemp hurd (shive) mixed with larger proportions of a lime-based binder. Hemp plaster has insulative qualities.

The choice of which bast fiber to use is primarily based on cost and availability.
Various car makers are beginning to use hemp in their cars, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Chrysler, Honda, Iveco, Lotus, Mercedes, Mitsubishi, Porsche, Saturn, Volkswagen and Volvo. For example, the Lotus Eco Elise
and the Mercedes C-Class both contain hemp (up to 20 kg in each car in the case of the latter).

The products are mainly specialty papers such as cigarette paper, banknotes and technical filter papers. Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fibre, a significantly lower lignin fraction as well as a higher tear resistance and tensile strength. However, production costs are about four times higher than for paper from wood, so hemp paper could not be used for mass applications as printing, writing and packaging paper.

Hemp jewellery includes bracelets, necklaces, anklets, rings, watches, and other adornments. Some jewellery features beads made from crystals, glass, stone, wood and bones. The hemp twine varies in thickness and comes in a variety of colors. There are many different stitches used to create hemp jewellery, however, the half knot and full knot stitches are most common.

Tarring was a labor-intensive process, and earned sailors the nickname ""Jack Tar"". Hemp rope was phased out when manila rope, which does not require tarring, became widely available. Manila is sometimes referred to as Manila hemp, but is not related to hemp; it is abac , a species of banana.

Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, gain organic certification, and gain the benefits of crop rotation. However, due to the plant's rapid and dense growth characteristics, some jurisdictions consider hemp a prohibited and noxious weed, much like Scotch Broom.

Alcohol fuel (ethanol or, less commonly, methanol) can be made by fermenting the whole plant.
Filtered hemp oil can be used directly to power diesel engines. In 1892, Rudolf Diesel invented the diesel engine, which he intended to power ""by a variety of fuels, especially vegetable and seed oils, which earlier were used for oil lamps, i.e. the Argand lamp.""Production of vehicle fuel from hemp is very small. Commercial biodiesel and biogas is typically produced from cereals, coconuts, palm seeds, and cheaper raw materials like garbage, wastewater, dead plant and animal material, animal feces and kitchen waste.

Dr. David Mitlin, from Clarkson University was hired by Alternet Systems to create a cheaper version, made of hemp, for graphene. The hemp supercapacitors created by Mitlin have been able to store 12 watt-hours of energy per Kg. This is over 2x as high as regular graphene supercapacitors, and cheaper to build. This new tech is promising and with high chances it can change the way we store energy nowadays.","Milk (body substance),[bdsu],33.08,C0026131|Cold Temperature,[npop],24.11,C0009264|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Eating,[orgf],12.94,C0013470|THROMBOCYTOPENIA 1 (disorder),[dsyn],12.93,C1839163|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0041912|Growth,[orgf],9.90,C0018270|Semen,[bdsu],9.87,C2756969|Intrinsic drive,[menp],9.86,C0013126|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.58,C0010352|Mental concentration,[menp],3.61,C0086045|Cold Temperature,[npop],24.11,C0009264|Light,[npop],17.80,C0023693|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.30,C0026131|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Eating,[orgf],12.94,C0013470|THROMBOCYTOPENIA 1 (disorder),[dsyn],12.93,C1839163|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0041912|Growth,[orgf],9.90,C0018270|Intrinsic drive,[menp],9.86,C0013126|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.58,C0010352|Heat (physical force),[npop],5.18,C0018837|Mental concentration,[menp],3.61,C0086045|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Wood material,[sbst],40.22,C0043217|Benign Rolandic Epilepsy,[dsyn],19.20,C2363129|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.14,C1096155|Penile Erection,[ortf],13.08,C0030847|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Fibrosis,[patf],9.88,C0016059|Patient Monitoring,[hlca],9.86,C0030695|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.17,C0008300|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|fiberglass,[sbst],12.90,C0060317|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Endocrine-Cerebroosteodysplasia,[dsyn],12.94,C2675227|Dental Pulp,[bpoc],49.75,C0011399|Wood material,[sbst],39.69,C0043217|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],13.03,C1096155|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Tears body substance,[bdsu],9.78,C0039409|Laceration,[inpo],6.63,C0043246|Rupture,[inpo],6.63,C3203359|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.57,C0080194|Wood material,[sbst],26.95,C0043217|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Chromosome 2q32-Q33 Deletion Syndrome,[dsyn],14.64,C2676739|Wakefulness,[menp],13.20,C0043012|Calculi,[bdsu],11.49,C0006736|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Skeletal bone,[bpoc],5.18,C0262950|Desiccation,[npop],20.16,C0011682|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Labor (Childbirth),[orgf],16.09,C0022864|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Thrombocytopenia-Absent Radius Syndrome,[cgab],13.09,C0175703|Blood capillaries,[bpoc],12.88,C0006901|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.72,C0162425|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Drinking Water,[sbst],24.11,C0599638|Negative Surgical Margin,[fndg],19.85,C1709157|Air (substance),[sbst],17.80,C0001861|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Soil,[sbst],14.64,C0037592|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Disasters,[phpr],9.73,C0012618|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Adult T-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia,[neop],20.95,C0023493|Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,[neop],20.95,C1961099|Avian crop,[bpoc],20.59,C0010352|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Growth,[orgf],9.78,C0018270|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],17.80,C0935572|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.81,C0011065|Feces,[bdsu],6.83,C0015733|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.43,C0080194|Plastics,[sbst],16.21,C0032167|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Wood material,[sbst],13.25,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|"
"('hemp seed', 'Cultivation')","Hemp is usually planted between March and May in the northern hemisphere, between September and November in the southern hemisphere. It matures in about three to four months.Millennia of selective breeding have resulted in varieties that display a wide range of traits; e.g. suited for a particular environments/latitudes, producing different ratios and compositions of terpenoids and cannabinoids (CBD, THC, CBG, CBC, CBN...etc.), fibre quality, oil/seed yield, etc. Hemp grown for fiber is planted closely, resulting in tall, slender plants with long fibers.The use of industrial hemp plant and its cultivation was commonplace until the 1900s when it was associated with its genetic sibling a.k.a. Drug-Type Cannabis species (which contain higher levels of psychoactive THC). Influential groups misconstrued hemp as a dangerous ""drug"", even though hemp is not a recreational drug and has the potential to be a sustainable and profitable crop for many farmers due to hemp's medical, structural and dietary uses.In the United States, the public's perception of hemp as marijuana has blocked hemp from becoming a useful crop and product,"" in spite of its vital importance prior to World War II. Ideally, according to Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the herb should be desiccated and harvested towards the end of flowering. This early cropping reduces the seed yield but improves the fiber yield and quality. In these strains of industrial hemp* the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content would have been very low.The seeds are sown with grain drills or other conventional seeding equipment to a depth of 1.27 to 2.54 cm. Greater seeding depths result in increased weed competition. Nitrogen should not be placed with the seed, but phosphate may be tolerated. The soil should have available 89 to 135 kg/ha of nitrogen, 46 kg/ha phosphorus, 67 kg/ha potassium, and 17 kg/ha sulfur. Organic fertilizers such as manure are one of the best methods of weed control.Hemp is considered by a 1998 study in Environmental Economics to be environmentally friendly due to a decrease of land use and other environmental impacts, indicating a possible decrease of ecological footprint in a US context compared to typical benchmarks. A 2010 study, however, that compared the production of paper specifically from hemp and eucalyptus concluded that ""industrial hemp presents higher environmental impacts than eucalyptus paper""; however, the article also highlights that ""there is scope for improving industrial hemp paper production"". Hemp is also claimed to require few pesticides and no herbicides, and it has been called a carbon negative raw material.
Results indicate that high yield of hemp may require high total nutrient levels (field plus fertilizer nutrients) similar to a high yielding wheat crop.","Avian crop,[bpoc],20.68,C0010352|Impacts, Environmental,[phpr],20.22,C0282165|Adult T-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia,[neop],19.36,C0023493|Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,[neop],19.36,C1961099|World War II,[evnt],19.21,C0681710|Soil,[sbst],14.64,C0037592|Hydranencephaly with Renal Aplasia-Dysplasia,[dsyn],13.05,C1856053|Selective Breeding,[genf],12.94,C0678952|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],9.87,C0024809|Perception,[menp],9.87,C0030971|Manure,[sbst],6.59,C0024765|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.55,C0080194|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.58,C0010352|"

"('turmeric', 'Uses')","Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods. It is used mostly in savory dishes, but also is used in some sweet dishes, such as the cake sfouf. In India, turmeric leaf is used to prepare special sweet dishes, patoleo, by layering rice flour and coconut-jaggery mixture on the leaf, then closing and steaming it in a special utensil (chondr ). Most turmeric is used in the form of rhizome powder to impart a golden yellow color. It is used in many products such as canned beverages, baked products, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, yellow cakes, orange juice, biscuits, popcorn color, cereals, sauces, and gelatin. It is a principal ingredient in curry powders. Although typically used in its dried, powdered form, turmeric also is used fresh, like ginger. It has numerous uses in East Asian recipes, such as a pickle that contains large chunks of fresh soft turmeric.
Turmeric is used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking. Various Iranian khoresh recipes begin with onions caramelized in oil and turmeric. The Moroccan spice mix ras el hanout typically includes turmeric. In South Africa, turmeric is used to give boiled white rice a golden color, known as geelrys (yellow rice) traditionally served with bobotie. In Vietnamese cuisine, turmeric powder is used to color and enhance the flavors of certain dishes, such as b nh x o, b nh kh t, and mi quang. The staple Cambodian curry paste, kroeung, used in many dishes including amok, typically contains fresh turmeric. In Indonesia, turmeric leaves are used for Minang or Padang curry base of Sumatra, such as rendang, sate padang, and many other varieties. In Thailand, fresh turmeric rhizomes are used widely in many dishes, in particular in the southern Thai cuisine, such as yellow curry and turmeric soup. Turmeric is used in a hot drink called ""turmeric latte"" or ""golden milk"" that is made with milk, frequently coconut milk. The turmeric milk drink known as haldi doodh (haldi means turmeric in Hindi) is a South Asian recipe. Sold in the US and UK, the drink known as ""golden mylk"" uses nondairy milk and sweetener, and sometimes black pepper after the traditional recipe (which may also use ghee). 
 The golden yellow color of turmeric is due to curcumin. It also contains an orange-colored volatile oil. Turmeric makes a poor fabric dye, as it is not very light fast, but is commonly used in Indian  clothing, such as saris and Buddhist monks's robes. It is used to protect food products from sunlight, coded as E100 when used as a food additive. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products. A curcumin and polysorbate solution or curcumin powder dissolved in alcohol is used for water-containing products. Overcoloring, such as in pickles, relishes, and mustard, is sometimes used to compensate for fading.
In combination with annatto (E160b), turmeric has been used to color cheeses, yogurt, dry mixes, salad dressings, winter butter, and margarine. Turmeric is used to give a yellow color to some prepared mustards, canned chicken broths, and other foods often as a much cheaper replacement for saffron. 
 Turmeric paper, also called curcuma paper or in German literature, Curcumapapier, is paper steeped in a tincture of turmeric and allowed to dry. It is used in chemical analysis as an indicator for acidity and alkalinity. The paper is yellow in acidic and neutral solutions and turns brown to reddish-brown in alkaline solutions, with transition between pH of 7.4 and 9.2. 
 Turmeric grows wild in the forests of South and Southeast Asia, where it is collected for use in classical Indian medicine (Siddha or Ayurveda).In Eastern India, the plant is used as one of the nine components of navapatrika along with young plantain or banana plant, taro leaves, barley (jayanti), wood apple (bilva), pomegranate (darimba), asoka, manaka (Arum), or manakochu, and rice paddy. The Haldi ceremony called gaye holud in Bengal (literally ""yellow on the body"") is a ceremony observed during wedding celebrations of people of Indian culture all throughout the Indian subcontinent.In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as a part of the Tamil Telugu marriage ritual, dried turmeric tuber tied with string is used to create a Thali necklace. In western and coastal India, during weddings of the Marathi and Konkani people, Kannada Brahmins, turmeric tubers are tied with strings by the couple to their wrists during a ceremony, Kankanabandhana.Friedrich Ratzel reported in The History of Mankind during 1896, that in Micronesia, turmeric powder was applied for embellishment of body, clothing, utensils, and ceremonial uses.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.72,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.32,C0682897|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.68,C2987717|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],85.18,C0026131|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.08,C0020498|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],26.01,C0268059|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.48,C2350229|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Paste substance,[sbst],3.61,C0030634|furuncle,[dsyn],3.45,C0242301|Sunlight,[npop],19.21,C0038817|Fasting,[fndg],16.23,C0015663|Light,[npop],16.23,C0023693|Solutions,[sbst],6.83,C0037633|Desiccation,[npop],9.81,C0011682|Solutions,[sbst],13.43,C0037633|Heartburn,[sosy],12.89,C0018834|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Marriage, life event,[fndg],22.35,C0024841|Forests,[npop],16.04,C0086312|Wood material,[sbst],12.96,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|"

"('chrysanthemum flower', 'Economic uses')","Modern cultivated chrysanthemums are showier than their wild relatives. The flower heads occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like or decorative, like pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivars developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colors are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is Chrysanthemum   morifolium (syn. C.   grandiflorum), derived primarily from C. indicum, but also involving other species.
Over 140 cultivars of chrysanthemum have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).Chrysanthemums are divided into two basic groups, garden hardy and exhibition. Garden hardy mums are new perennials capable of wintering in most northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any mechanical assistance, such as staking, and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties, though, require staking, overwintering in a relatively dry, cool environment, and sometimes the addition of night lights.
The exhibition varieties can be used to create many amazing plant forms, such as large disbudded blooms, spray forms, and many artistically trained forms, such as thousand-bloom, standard (trees), fans, hanging baskets, topiary, bonsai, and cascades.
Chrysanthemum blooms are divided into 13 different bloom forms by the US National Chrysanthemum Society, Inc., which is in keeping with the international classification system. The bloom forms are defined by the way in which the ray and disk florets are arranged. Chrysanthemum blooms are composed of many individual flowers (florets), each one capable of producing a seed. The disk florets are in the center of the bloom head, and the ray florets are on the perimeter. The ray florets are considered imperfect flowers, as they only possess the female reproductive organs, while the disk florets are considered perfect flowers, as they possess both male and female reproductive organs.
Irregular incurves are bred to produce a giant head called an ogiku. The disk florets are concealed in layers of curving ray florets that hang down to create a 'skirt'. Regular incurves are similar, but usually with smaller blooms and a dense, globular form. Intermediate incurve blooms may have broader florets and a less densely flowered head.
In the reflex form, the disk florets are concealed and the ray florets reflex outwards to create a mop-like appearance. The decorative form is similar to reflex blooms, but the ray florets usually do not radiate at more than a 90  angle to the stem.
The pompon form is fully double, of small size, and very globular in form. Single and semidouble blooms have exposed disk florets and one to seven rows of ray florets. In the anemone form, the disk florets are prominent, often raised and overshadowing the ray florets. The spoon-form disk florets are visible and the long, tubular ray florets are spatulate. In the spider form, the disk florets are concealed, and the ray florets are tube-like with hooked or barbed ends, hanging loosely around the stem. In the brush and thistle variety, the disk florets may be visible.
In Japan, a form of bonsai chrysanthemum was developed over the centuries. The cultivated flower has a lifespan of about 5 years and can be kept in miniature size. Another method is to use pieces of dead wood and the flower grows over the back along the wood to give the illusion from the front that the miniature tree blooms. 
 Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers of the species C. morifolium are boiled to make a tea in some parts of Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as chrysanthemum tea (   , pinyin: j hu  ch , in Chinese). In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called gukhwaju (   ).
Chrysanthemum leaves are steamed or boiled and used as greens, especially in Chinese cuisine. The flowers may be added to dishes such as mixian in broth, or thick snakemeat soup (  ) to enhance the aroma. Small chrysanthemums are used in Japan as a sashimi garnish. 
 Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum [or Tanacetum] cinerariaefolium) is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized, and the active components, called pyrethrins, which occur in the achenes, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. In sublethal doses, they have an insect-repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides. They are not persistent, being biodegradable, and also decompose easily on exposure to light. Pyrethroids such as permethrin are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum. Despite this, chrysanthemum leaves are still a major host for destructive pests, such as leafminer flies including L. trifolii.Persian powder is an example of industrial product of chrysanthemum insecticide.

"('chicory', 'Culinary uses')","Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, roasted, ground, and used as an additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and the southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. In France a mixture of 60% chicory and 40% coffee is sold as Ricor . It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the ""East German coffee crisis"" of 1976 79. It is also added to coffee in Spanish,  Greek, Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian cuisines.Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts (commonly expected to have a coffee-like flavor). Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.Wild chicory leaves usually have a bitter taste. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Ligurian and Apulian regions of Italy and also in the southern part of India.  In Ligurian cuisine,  wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Apulian region, wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish fave e cicorie selvatiche. In Albania, the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water, the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be saut ed with garlic, anchovies, and other ingredients. In this form, the resulting greens might be combined with pasta or accompany meat dishes.

Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:
Radicchio usually has variegated red or red and green leaves. Some only refer to the white-veined red-leaved type as radicchio, also known as red endive and red chicory. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted. It can also be used to add color and zest to salads. It is largely used in Italy in different varieties, the most famous being the ones from Treviso (known as radicchio rosso di Treviso), from Verona (radicchio di Verona), and Chioggia (radicchio di Chioggia), which are classified as an IGP. It is also common in Greece.
Sugarloaf looks rather like cos lettuce, with tightly packed leaves.
Belgian endive is known in Dutch as witloof or witlof (""white leaf""), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States, indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of northern France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-colored, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors in the absence of sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (etiolation). The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves.  It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale color and delicate flavor.  The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem at the bottom of the head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness.  Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Belgium. Today France is the largest producer of endive.
Catalogna chicory (Cichorium intybus var. foliosum), also known as puntarelle, includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio) of chicory and is used throughout Italy.

Although leaf chicory is often called ""endive"", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus, distinct from Belgian endive.

Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a witlofbier, from the Dutch name for the plant.Around 1970, it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power 10% that of sucrose and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, about 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.

In all five species, the dried bark is used as a spice. Chinese cassia's flavour is less delicate than that of Ceylon cinnamon. Its bark is thicker, more difficult to crush, and has a rougher texture than that of Ceylon cinnamon.Most of the spice sold as cinnamon in the United States, United Kingdom, and India is Chinese cinnamon. ""Indonesian cinnamon"" (C. burmannii) is sold in much smaller amounts.Chinese cassia is produced in both China and Vietnam. Until the 1960s, Vietnam was the world's most important producer of Saigon cinnamon, which has a higher oil content, and consequently has a stronger flavor. Because of the disruption caused by the Vietnam War, however, production of Indonesian cassia in the highlands of the Indonesia island of Sumatra was increased to meet demand. Indonesian cassia has the lowest oil content of the three types of cassia, so commands the lowest price. Chinese cassia has a sweeter flavor than Indonesian cassia, similar to Saigon cinnamon, but with lower oil content.Cassia bark (both powdered and in whole, or ""stick"" form) is used as a flavoring agent for confectionery, desserts, pastries, and meat; it is specified in many curry recipes, where Ceylon cinnamon is less suitable. Cassia is sometimes added to Ceylon cinnamon, but is a much thicker, coarser product. Cassia is sold as pieces of bark (as pictured below) or as neat quills or sticks. Cassia sticks can be distinguished from Ceylon cinnamon sticks in this manner: Ceylon cinnamon sticks have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are extremely hard and are usually made up of one thick layer.Cassia buds, although rare, are also occasionally used as a spice. They resemble cloves in appearance and have a mild, flowery cinnamon flavor. Cassia buds are primarily used in old-fashioned pickling recipes, marinades, and teas.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],101.83,C0682897|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],68.71,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],39.87,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],39.87,C0022655|Vietnam Conflict,[evnt],19.38,C1449760|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],14.64,C0424320|"

The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw in a similar way to a mung bean.The root of the radish is usually eaten raw, although tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, also present in mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.Radishes are mostly used in salads, but also appear in many European dishes. Radish leaves are sometimes used in recipes, like potato soup or as a sauteed side dish. They are also found blended with fruit juices in some recipes.  In Mexican cuisine, sliced radishes are used in combination with shredded lettuce as garnish for traditional dishes such as tostadas, sopes, enchiladas and Posole stew.
In Indian cuisine the seed pods are called ""moongra"" or ""mogri"" and can be used in many dishes. 
 The seeds of radishes can be pressed to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not suitable for human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, can be used as a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.""Radi"", a spiral-cut radish that is sprinkled with salt and maybe chives, and eaten with the fingers, is traditionally served with beer at the Bavarian Oktoberfest. 
 The daikon varieties of radish are important parts of East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisine. In Japan and Korea, radish dolls are sometimes made as children's toys. Daikon is also one of the plants that make up the Japanese Festival of Seven Herbs (Nanakusa no sekku) on the seventh day after the new year.Citizens of Oaxaca, Mexico, celebrate the Night of the Radishes (Noche de los r banos) on December 23 as a part of Christmas celebrations. This folk art competition uses a large type of radish up to 50 cm (20 in) long and weighing up to 3 kg (6.6 lb).

"('lychee seed', 'Cultivation and uses')","Lychees are extensively grown in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and the rest of tropical Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and in South Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean, Australia, Israel, and the southeastern United States. They require a tropical climate that is frost-free and is not below the temperature of  4  C (25  F). Lychees also require a climate with high summer heat, rainfall, and humidity. Growth is best on well-drained, slightly acidic soils rich in organic matter and mulch. A wide range of cultivars are available, with early and late maturing forms suited to warmer and cooler climates, respectively. They are also grown as an ornamental tree, as well as for their fruit. The most common way of propagating lychee is through a method called Air Layering or Marcotting. Air-layers, or marcotts, are made by cincturing a branch of a mature tree, covering the cut with a rooting medium, such as peat or sphagnum moss, then wrapping the medium with polyethylene film and allowing the cut to root. Once significant rooting has occurred the marcott is cut from the branch and potted up.According to folklore, a lychee tree that is not producing much fruit can be girdled, leading to more fruit production. When the central opening of trees is carried out as part of training and pruning, stereo fruiting can be achieved for higher orchard productivity.Lychees are commonly sold fresh in Asian markets. The red rind turns dark brown when the fruit is refrigerated, but the taste is not affected. It is also sold canned year-round. The fruit can be dried with the rind intact, at which point the flesh shrinks and darkens.","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],49.02,C0040452|Climate,[npop],32.64,C0008946|Air (substance),[sbst],32.42,C0001861|Humidity,[npop],20.95,C0020167|Tropical Climate,[npop],20.95,C0041183|Body Temperature,[orga],16.16,C0005903|Peat,[sbst],14.64,C0030739|Taste Perception,[ortf],14.64,C0039336|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Growth,[orgf],11.49,C0018270|Affect (mental function),[menp],10.28,C0001721|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],9.91,C0024809|Desiccation,[npop],9.85,C0011682|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.43,C0018837|"
"('lychee seed', 'Poisoning')","In 1962, it was found that lychee seeds contained methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), a homologue of hypoglycin A, which caused hypoglycemia in animal studies. 
Since the end of the 1990s, unexplained outbreaks of encephalopathy occurred, appearing to affect only children in India (where it is called chamki bukhar), and northern Vietnam (where it was called Ac Mong encephalitis after the Vietnamese word for nightmare) during the lychee harvest season from May to June.A 2013 investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in India, showed that cases were linked to the consumption of lychee fruit, causing a noninflammatory encephalopathy that mimicked symptoms of Jamaican vomiting sickness. Because low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) of less than 70 mg/dL in the undernourished children on admission was common, and associated with a poorer outcome (44% of all cases were fatal) the CDC identified the illness as a hypoglycemic encephalopathy.The investigation linked the illness to hypoglycin A and MCPG toxicity, and to malnourished children eating lychees (particularly unripe ones) on an empty stomach. Other assessment indicated that lychee contains ""unusual amino acids"" affecting gluconeogenesis and  -oxidation of fatty acids, contributing to acute illness.The CDC report recommended that parents ensure their children limit lychee consumption and have an evening meal, elevating blood glucose levels that may be sufficient to deter illness.Earlier studies had incorrectly concluded that transmission may occur from direct contact with lychees contaminated by bat saliva, urine, or guano or with other vectors, such as insects found in lychee trees or sand flies, as in the case of Chandipura virus. A 2017 study found that pesticides used in the plantations could be responsible for the encephalitis and deaths of young children in Bangladesh.","Hypoglycemia,[dsyn],13.03,C0020615|Encephalopathies,[dsyn],29.87,C0085584|Hypoglycemia,[dsyn],29.46,C0020615|Encephalitis,[dsyn],26.05,C0014038|Child Malnutrition,[dsyn],20.23,C1257753|Nightmares,[sosy],17.80,C0028084|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Stomach,[bpoc],13.14,C0038351|Gluconeogenesis,[moft],13.07,C0017715|Vomiting,[sosy],13.03,C0042963|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Urine,[bdsu],11.49,C0042036|disease transmission,[patf],11.49,C0242781|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.88,C0011065|Disease Outbreaks,[phpr],9.88,C0012652|saliva,[bdsu],9.88,C0036087|Consumption of goods,[acty],7.25,C0009830|"

Japan grows its own lotus but still must import 18,000 tons of lotus rhizome each year, of which China provides 15,000 tons yearly.Rhizomes contain high amounts of starch (31.2%) without characteristic taste or odour. The texture is comparable to a raw potato. The binding and disintegration properties of isolated Nelumbo starch have been compared with maize and potato starch; Nelumbo starch is shown to be superior as an adjuvant in the preparation of tablets. When dried, N. nucifera is also made into flour, another popular use of this vegetable. 
 Lotus pip tea is consumed in Korea. 
 Fresh lotus seeds (simplified Chinese:     ; traditional Chinese:     ; pinyin: xi n li nz ; Cantonese Yale: s n l hnj ) are nutritious but also vulnerable to microbial contamination, especially fungal infections. Therefore, mostly dry lotus seed-based products are found on the market. Traditional sun baking combining with charcoal processing dries the seeds but results in loss of nutrients. Freeze-dried lotus seeds have a longer shelf life and maintain original nutrients , while no differences in flavour are found after rehydration compared to fresh lotus seeds.Dry stored lotus seeds are sensitive to moisture and mold infestation; researchers continue to explore new ways to preserve fresh lotus seeds for example radiation processing.Lotus seeds can be processed into moon cake, lotus seed noodles and food in forms of paste, fermented milk, rice wine, ice cream, popcorn (phool makhana) and others, with lotus seeds as the main raw material. Traditional Eastern medicine claims that fresh lotus seed wine has thirst quenching, spleen healing and anti-diarrheal advantages after drinking, attributed to unspecified bioactive compounds. Lotus seed tea is consumed in Korea, and lotus embryo tea is consumed in China and Vietnam. 
 Young lotus stems are used as a salad ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine.
In South Indian states, the lotus stem is sliced, marinated with salt to dry, and the dried slices are fried and used as a side dish. In Kerala (in Malayalam ""    "") and Tamil Nadu, this end product is called "" Thamara Vathal"". 
 In China and Korea, lotus leaf tea (Chinese:     yeonipcha) is made from the leaves of the lotus. It is also used as a wrap for steaming rice and sticky rice and other steamed dishes in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as lo mai gai in Chinese cuisine or kao hor bai bua (Thai:             ), fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf in Thai cuisine. 
 In Korea, lotus flower tea (    yeonkkotcha) is made from the dried petals of the white lotus.
The stamens can be dried and made into a fragrant herbal tea (Chinese:     ; pinyin: li nhu  cha; Cantonese Yale: l hnf a chah), or used to impart a scent to tea leaves (particularly in Vietnam). This Vietnamese lotus tea is called tr  sen, ch  sen, or ch    p sen. 
 The petals, leaves and rhizome can also all be eaten raw, but there is a risk of parasite transmission (e.g., Fasciolopsis buski): it is therefore recommended that they be cooked before eating. 
 Nelumbo nucifera shows high potential for usage in wastewater treatment removing polluting compounds and heavy metals. It is able to grow in variable water conditions and in low light intensity. Various studies show the successful use of N. nucifera to counteract water eutrophication. The leaves of the floating lotus reduce sunlight reaching the lower part of the water.  This suppresses algae growth in N. nucifera aquatic systems and thus, the oxygen content is up to 20% higher than in other aquatic plant systems. Due to intense agricultural practices, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are major problems in aquatic systems. N. nucifera is able to assimilate a higher content of phosphorus than aquatic plants currently used for water remediation (such as water hyacinth). It also assimilates nitrogen (""denitrification"") and creates a habitat for bacterial growth in the water body. Through rhizofiltration, heavy metals   including arsenic, copper and cadmium   can be removed efficiently from the water. The results observed are impressive showing 96% of copper and 85% cadmium metals removed after a seven-day incubation period. The accumulation of heavy metals doesn't show morphological symptoms of metal toxicity; however, the rhizome quality for human consumption needs further study. 
 Currently most rhizomes are consumed fresh and it is not common to store them due to their poor shelf life performance. This limits export possibilities for low-income production countries in Asia. Rhizomes quickly lose water, oxidation occurs and nutrient composition changes within a short time after harvest. Optimal storage temperatures range between 5 to 8  C (41 to 46  F). There are three different approaches to storing rhizomes. By stacking the rhizomes, they are storable and remain fresh for about three weeks. Special stacking with silver sand and soil results in five to six layers that prevent water loss, thus the rhizome stays fresh for up to two months. However the method is not suitable for commercialization but rather for home use. Hydrogen sulfide fumigation reduces enzymatic browning and therefore ensures rhizome quality. Dipping the rhizomes in a salt solution prevents oxidation and bacterial reproduction, which allows storage for up to five months and a greater export ability. This treatment is related to high cost and inefficient cleaning process before eating the rhizomes. 
 Nelumbo nucifera contains some thermal-stable proteins that might be useful in protein bio engineering processes. The proteins are characterized by seed longevity used for cell protection and repair under stress.  There are also several indications that compounds of N. nucifera are used in drug fabrication in human health research for multiple purposes. 
 The distinctive dried seed heads, which resemble the spouts of watering cans, are widely sold throughout the world for decorative purposes and for dried flower arranging.
In Asia, the petals are sometimes used for garnish, while the large leaves are used as a wrap for food, not frequently eaten (for example, as a wrapper for zongzi).
A unique fabric from the lotus plant fibers is produced only at Inle lake, Myanmar and in Siem Reap (Cambodia) is used for weaving special robes for Buddha images called kya thingahn (lotus robe).","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],32.36,C0040452|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.18,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],17.80,C0016701|Fasting,[fndg],16.17,C0015663|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.16,C0020498|Odors,[npop],14.64,C0028884|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Desiccation,[npop],35.02,C0011682|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.21,C0682897|Sunlight,[npop],19.19,C0038817|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Spleen,[bpoc],16.08,C0037993|Drinking function,[orgf],16.05,C0684271|Alcohol consumption,[inbe],12.89,C0001948|Electromagnetic Radiation,[npop],12.88,C0034519|Diarrhea,[sosy],12.85,C0011991|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.92,C0043240|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|Mycoses,[dsyn],6.91,C0026946|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.74,C0020517|Radiation,[npop],6.57,C0851346|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.68,C0030499|Paste substance,[sbst],3.43,C0030634|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.18,C0020498|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.13,C0020498|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],26.05,C0221023|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Fragrance (odor),[npop],7.09,C2987717|Eating,[orgf],26.13,C0013470|disease transmission,[patf],9.74,C0242781|Drinking Water,[sbst],117.90,C0599638|Ability,[orga],29.46,C0085732|Growth,[orgf],19.70,C0018270|Intention - mental process,[menp],19.60,C0162425|Sunlight,[npop],19.27,C0038817|Light,[npop],16.18,C0023693|Denitrification,[phpr],14.64,C0598972|Body water (substance),[bdsu],11.49,C0005909|Eutrophication,[phpr],9.99,C0015191|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],9.74,C0274869|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.43,C0009830|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.43,C0599638|Soil,[sbst],14.64,C0037592|Ability,[orga],13.09,C0085732|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Solutions,[sbst],6.58,C0037633|Post-Translational Protein Processing,[moft],19.21,C0033666|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.90,C0043240|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|"

"('forsythia fruit', 'Cultivation and uses')","The hybrids Forsythia   intermedia (F. suspensa   F. viridissima) and Forsythia    variabilis (F. ovata   F. suspensa) have been produced in cultivation.  Forsythia intermedia is a hybrid between F. suspensa and F. viridissima. Many cultivars have been selected from this cross including dwarf and compact forms.Forsythias are popular early spring flowering shrubs in gardens and parks, especially during Eastertide; Forsythias are nicknamed the Easter Tree because its branches appear to be waving in praise of the resurrection of Jesus. Two are commonly cultivated for ornament, Forsythia   intermedia and Forsythia suspensa. They are both spring flowering shrubs, with yellow flowers. They are grown and prized for being tough, reliable garden plants. Forsythia   intermedia is the more commonly grown, is smaller, has an upright habit, and produces strongly coloured flowers. Forsythia suspensa is a large to very large shrub, can be grown as a weeping shrub on banks, and has paler flowers. Many named garden cultivars can also be found. Forsythia is frequently forced indoors in the early spring.
Commercial propagation is usually by cuttings, taken from green wood after flowering in late spring to early summer; alternatively, cuttings may be taken between November and February. Low hanging boughs often take root, and can be removed for transplanting. A common practice (known as layering) is to place a weight over a branch to keep it on the ground and, after it has rooted, to dig up the roots and cut the rooted part from the main branch; this can then be planted.
Forsythia suspensa is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs in Chinese herbology.

Lotus rhizomes have a crunchy texture with sweet-tangy flavours and are a classic dish at many banquets where they are deep-fried, stir-fried, or stuffed with meats or preserved fruits. Salads with prawns, sesame oil or coriander leaves are also popular. Unfortunately, fresh lotus root slices are limited by a fast browning rate. Lotus root tea is consumed in Korea.
Japan is one of the primary users of the rhizomes, representing about 1% of all vegetables consumed. Japan grows its own lotus but still must import 18,000 tons of lotus rhizome each year, of which China provides 15,000 tons yearly.Rhizomes contain high amounts of starch (31.2%) without characteristic taste or odour. The texture is comparable to a raw potato. The binding and disintegration properties of isolated Nelumbo starch have been compared with maize and potato starch; Nelumbo starch is shown to be superior as an adjuvant in the preparation of tablets. When dried, N. nucifera is also made into flour, another popular use of this vegetable. 
 The flavonol miquelianin, as well as the alkaloids (+)-(1R)-coclaurine and ( )-(1S)-norcoclaurine, can be found in the leaves of N. nucifera. The plant also contains nuciferine and aporphine.Fresh lotus seeds (simplified Chinese:     ; traditional Chinese:     ; pinyin: xi n li nz ; Cantonese Yale: s n l hnj ) are nutritious but also vulnerable to microbial contamination, especially fungal infections. Therefore, mostly dry lotus seed-based products are found on the market. Traditional sun baking combining with charcoal processing dries the seeds but results in loss of nutrients. Freeze-dried lotus seeds have a longer shelf life and maintain original nutrients , while no differences in flavour are found after rehydration compared to fresh lotus seeds.Dry stored lotus seeds are sensitive to moisture and mold infestation; researchers continue to explore new ways to preserve fresh lotus seeds for example radiation processing.Lotus seeds can be processed into moon cake, lotus seed noodles and food in forms of paste, fermented milk, rice wine, ice cream, popcorn (phool makhana) and others, with lotus seeds as the main raw material. Traditional Eastern medicine claims that fresh lotus seed wine has thirst quenching, spleen healing and anti-diarrheal advantages after drinking, attributed to unspecified bioactive compounds. Lotus seed tea is consumed in Korea, and lotus embryo tea is consumed in China and Vietnam.","Cholera,[dsyn],17.80,C0008354|Hematuria,[dsyn],17.80,C0018965|Hematemesis,[fndg],16.21,C0018926|Epistaxis,[patf],14.64,C0014591|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.05,C0011991|Kidney,[bpoc],9.87,C0022646|Heart,[bpoc],8.34,C0018787|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.48,C0009830|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],32.36,C0040452|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.18,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],17.80,C0016701|Fasting,[fndg],16.17,C0015663|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.16,C0020498|Odors,[npop],14.64,C0028884|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Desiccation,[npop],35.02,C0011682|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.21,C0682897|Sunlight,[npop],19.19,C0038817|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Spleen,[bpoc],16.08,C0037993|Drinking function,[orgf],16.05,C0684271|Alcohol consumption,[inbe],12.89,C0001948|Electromagnetic Radiation,[npop],12.88,C0034519|Diarrhea,[sosy],12.85,C0011991|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.92,C0043240|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|Mycoses,[dsyn],6.91,C0026946|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.74,C0020517|Radiation,[npop],6.57,C0851346|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.68,C0030499|Paste substance,[sbst],3.43,C0030634|"

"('lingzhi mushroom', 'Use')","Ganoderma lucidum produces a group of triterpenes called ganoderic acids, which have a molecular structure similar to that of steroid hormones. It also contains other compounds often found in fungal materials, including polysaccharides (such as beta-glucan), coumarin, mannitol, and alkaloids. Sterols isolated from the mushroom include ganoderol, ganoderenic acid, ganoderiol, ganodermanontriol, lucidadiol, and ganodermadiol.A 2015 Cochrane database review found insufficient evidence to justify the use of G. lucidum as a first-line cancer treatment. It suggests that G. lucidum may have ""benefit as an alternative adjunct to conventional treatment in consideration of its potential of enhancing tumour response and stimulating host immunity."" Existing studies do not support the use of G. lucidum for treatment of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
 Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) is added to boiling water which is then reduced to a simmer, covered, and left for 2 hours. The resulting liquid is dark and fairly bitter in taste. The red lingzhi is often more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated to increase the concentration. Alternatively, it can be used as an ingredient in a formula decoction, or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.Lingzhi is now commercially manufactured and sold. Since the early 1970s, most lingzhi is cultivated. Lingzhi can grow on substrates such as sawdust, grain, and wood logs. After formation of the fruiting body, lingzhi is most commonly harvested, dried, ground, and processed into tablets or capsules to be directly ingested or made into tea or soup. Other lingzhi products include processed fungal mycelia or spores.","risk factors,[fndg],22.36,C0035648|Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent,[dsyn],16.11,C0011860|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.47,C0006826|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],3.44,C0007222|Neoplasms,[neop],3.42,C0027651|Taste Perception,[ortf],26.14,C0039336|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.49,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.47,C2350229|Wood material,[sbst],12.96,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Mental concentration,[menp],5.18,C0086045|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|"

"('aloe vera', 'Uses')","Although there is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extracts for either cosmetic or medicinal purposes, the cosmetics and alternative medicine industries regularly make claims regarding the soothing, moisturizing, and healing properties of aloe vera. There is no good evidence aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns, nor that topical application is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence for using aloe vera topically to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by intravenous infusion.Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, but at certain high doses, its toxic properties could be severe when taken orally. 
 Aloin, a compound found in the exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it failed to provide the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.Aloe vera juice is marketed to support the health of the digestive system, but there is neither scientific evidence nor regulatory approval to support this claim. The extracts and quantities typically used for such purposes appear to be dose-dependent for toxic effects. 
 Aloe vera is used in traditional medicine as a skin treatment. In Ayurvedic medicine it is called kathalai, as are extracts from agave.  Early records of Aloe vera use appear in the Ebers Papyrus from the 16th century BC, and in Dioscorides' De Materia Medica and Pliny the Elder's Natural History   both written in the mid-first century AD. It is also written of in the Juliana Anicia Codex of 512 AD. 
 Aloe vera is used on facial tissues where it is promoted as a moisturizer and anti-irritant to reduce chafing of the nose. Cosmetic companies commonly add sap or other derivatives from Aloe vera to products such as makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, shaving cream, or shampoos.

Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.
Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.Adverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia.

They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having mutated into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England. 
 Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil.  -Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent. 
 Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.Rose hips are occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup or are brewed for tea, primarily for their high vitamin C content. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine especially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight.
Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas.
In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.
Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain Rosa species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr          , ""compound of roses"", from      , ""of roses"") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the ""immortal oil of the rose"" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him ""among rose blossoms"". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The color of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht D rer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redout  is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul C zanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works.","Breeding,[orgf],9.85,C0006159|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Breeding,[orgf],10.28,C0006159|Breeding,[orgf],9.74,C0006159|Avian crop,[bpoc],13.55,C0010352|Disease,[dsyn],9.85,C0012634|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Plague,[dsyn],20.95,C0032064|Climate,[npop],16.30,C0008946|Air (substance),[sbst],16.21,C0001861|Weather,[npop],16.21,C0043085|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Temperance,[inbe],6.60,C0039475|Body Weight,[orga],45.08,C0005910|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Pallor,[fndg],12.94,C0030232|Darkness,[npop],12.91,C0010986|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.59,C0332679|Fragrance (odor),[npop],6.90,C2987717|Hip structure,[bpoc],53.62,C0019552|Bone structure of ischium,[bpoc],38.71,C0022122|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.82,C0080194|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.40,C0682897|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.24,C0682897|flavor enhancers,[sbst],58.68,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],16.04,C0016701|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.57,C2987717|Hip structure,[bpoc],14.64,C0019552|Bone structure of ischium,[bpoc],19.45,C0022122|Hip structure,[bpoc],13.14,C0019552|Stomach,[bpoc],13.03,C0038351|Growth,[orgf],9.87,C0018270|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.56,C0006826|In Blood,[bdsu],16.04,C0005768|Tooth Crowns,[bpoc],16.04,C0226993|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Creativity,[menp],12.93,C0010297|Alzheimer disease, familial, type 3,[dsyn],12.92,C1843013|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.87,C0027627|Personality Character,[menp],9.99,C0007952|Blood,[bdsu],9.74,C0005767|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Injury wounds,[inpo],3.98,C0043250|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.98,C3263723|Rough endoplasmic reticulum,[celc],28.87,C0230779|War,[acty],16.16,C0043027|Tooth Crowns,[bpoc],16.03,C0226993|Conflict (Psychology),[inbe],9.75,C0009671|Happiness,[menp],9.73,C0018592|Childbirth,[orgf],16.08,C1148523|"
"('roselle flower bud', 'Uses')","In India, the plant is primarily cultivated for the production of bast fibre used in cordage, made from its stem. The fibre may be used as a substitute for jute in making burlap. Hibiscus, specifically roselle, has been used in folk medicine as a diuretic and mild laxative.The red calyces of the plant are increasingly exported to the United States and Europe, particularly Germany, where they are used as food colourings. It can be found in markets (as flowers or syrup) in places, such as France, where there are Senegalese immigrant communities. The green leaves are used like a spicy version of spinach. They give flavour to the Senegalese fish and rice dish thieboudienne. Proper records are not kept, but the Senegalese government estimates national production and consumption at 700 t (770 short tons) per year. In Burma their green leaves are the main ingredient in chin baung kyaw curry.Brazilians attribute stomachic, emollient, and resolutive properties to the bitter roots.In Maharashtra, roselle is called ambadi. The ambadi leaves are mixed with green chillies, salt, some garlic to prepare a chutney which is served with jowar (sorghum) or bajra (millet) made bhakri (a flat bread). This is eaten by farmers as breakfast to start their day. A dry dish or sukhi sabzi is prepare with ambadi leaves. In Andhra cuisine, roselle is called gongura and is extensively used. The leaves are steamed with lentils and cooked with dal. Another unique dish is prepared by mixing fried leaves with spices and made into a gongura pacchadi, the most famous dish of Andhra and Telangana often described as king of all Andhra foods.In Burmese cuisine, called chin baung ywet (lit. sour leaf), the roselle is widely used and considered affordable. It is perhaps the most widely eaten and popular vegetable in Burma. The leaves are fried with garlic, dried or fresh prawns and green chili or cooked with fish. A light soup made from roselle leaves and dried prawn stock is also a popular dish.
Among the Paites tribe of the Manipur Hibiscus sabdariffa and Hibiscus cannabinus locally known as anthuk are cooked along with chicken, fish, crab or pork or any meat, and cooked as a soup as one of their traditional cuisines.
In the Garo Hills of Meghalaya, it is known as galda and is consumed boiled with pork, chicken or fish. After monsoon, the leaves are dried and crushed into powder, then stored for cooking during winter in a rice powder stew, known as galda gisi pura. In the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, the plant is locally known as jajew, and the leaves are used in local cuisine, cooked with both dried and fresh fish. The Bodos and other indigenous Assamese communities of north east India cook its leaves with fish, shrimp or pork along with boiling it as vegetables which is much relished. Sometimes they add native lye called karwi or khar to bring down its tartness and add flavour.
In the Philippines, the leaves and flowers are used to add sourness to the chicken dish tinola (chicken stew).In Vietnam, the young leaves, stems and fruits are used for cooking soups with fish or eel.In Mali, the dried and ground leaves, also called djissima, are commonly used in Songha  cuisine, in the regions of Timbuktu, Gao and their surroundings. It is the main ingredient in at least two dishes, one called djissima-gounday, where rice is slowly cooked in a broth containing the leaves and lamb, and the other dish is called djissima-maf , where the leaves are cooked in a tomato sauce, also including lamb. Note that djissima-gounday is also considered an affordable dish.
In Namibia, it is called mutete, and it is consumed by people from the Kavango region in northeastern Namibia.
In the central African nations of Congo-Kinshasa,  Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon the leaves are referred to as oseille, and are used pur ed, or in a sauce, often with fish and/or aubergines.

In the Caribbean, a drink is made from sepals of the roselle fruit.  It is prepared by boiling fresh, frozen or dried sepals; and sometimes the calyces and seeds, of the fruit of the sorrel plant in water for 8 to 10 minutes (or until the water turns red), then adding sugar. It is often served chilled. This is  done in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Antigua, Barbados, Belize, St. Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica and St. Kitts and Nevis where the plant or fruit is called sorrel. The drink is one of several inexpensive beverages (aguas frescas) commonly consumed in Mexico and Central America; they are typically made from fresh fruits, juices or extracts. In Mexican restaurants in the US, the beverage is sometimes known simply as Jamaica (Spanish pronunciation: [xa mai.ka] HAH-MY-CAH). It is very popular in Trinidad and Tobago especially as a seasonal drink at Christmas where cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves are preferred to ginger. It is also popular in Jamaica, usually flavored with rum.
In Ghana, Mali, Senegal, The Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Benin calyces are used to prepare cold, sweet drinks popular in social events, often mixed with mint leaves, dissolved menthol candy, and/or fruit flavors.
The Middle Eastern and Sudanese ""Karkade"" (      ) is a cold drink made by soaking the dried Karkade calyces in cold water overnight in a refrigerator with sugar and some lemon or lime juice added. It is then consumed with or without ice cubes after the flowers have been strained. In Lebanon, toasted pine nuts are sometimes added.
Roselle is used in Nigeria to make a refreshing drink known as Zobo and natural fruit juices of pineapple and watermelon are added. Ginger is also sometimes added to the refreshing drink.With the advent in the U.S. of interest in south-of-the-border cuisine, the calyces are sold in bags usually labeled ""flor de Jamaica"" and have long been available in health food stores in the U.S. for making tea. In addition to being a popular homemade drink, Jarritos, a popular brand of Mexican soft drinks, makes a flor de Jamaica flavored carbonated beverage. Imported Jarritos can be readily found in the U.S.
In the US, a beverage known as hibiscus cooler is made from the tea, a sweetener, and sometimes juice of apple, grape or lemon. The beverage is sold by some juice companies.In the UK, the dried calyces and ready-made sorrel syrup are widely and cheaply available in Caribbean and Asian grocers. The fresh calyces are imported mainly during December and January to make Christmas and New Year infusions, which are often made into cocktails with rum. They are very perishable, rapidly developing fungal rot, and need to be used soon after purchase   unlike the dried product, which has a long shelf-life.
In Africa, especially the Sahel, roselle is commonly used to make a sugary herbal tea that is sold on the street. The dried flowers can be found in every market. Roselle tea is quite common in Italy where it spread during the first decades of the 20th century as a typical product of the Italian colonies. The Carib Brewery Trinidad Limited, a Trinidad and Tobago brewery, produces a 'Shandy Sorrel' in which the tea is combined with beer.
In Thailand, roselle is generally drunk as a cool drink, and it can be made into a wine.
Hibiscus flowers are commonly found in commercial herbal teas, especially teas advertised as berry-flavoured, as they give a bright red colouring to the drink.
Rosella flowers are sold as wild hibiscus flowers in syrup in Australia as a gourmet product. Recipes include filling them with goats cheese; serving them on baguette slices baked with brie; and placing one plus a little syrup in a champagne flute before adding the champagne   the bubbles cause the flower to open.
In Dodoma Tanzania the Roselle juice is brewed to make Roselle wine famous by the name of choya.

It is similar in flavour to plum jam, although more acidic. It differs from other jams in that the pectin is obtained from boiling the interior buds of the rosella flowers. It is thus possible to make rosella jam with nothing but rosella buds and sugar.In Burma, the buds of the roselle are made into 'preserved fruits' or jams. Depending on the method and the preference, the seeds are removed or included. The jams, made from roselle buds and sugar, are red and tangy.
In India, Roselle is commonly made into a type of pickle.
""Sorrel jelly"" is manufactured in Trinidad.
Rosella jam is made in Queensland, Australia as a home-made or speciality product sold at fetes and other community events.

When it flowers in the early spring, a plum tree will be covered in blossoms, and in a good year approximately 50% of the flowers will be pollinated and become plums. Flowering starts after 80 growing degree days.
If the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called brown rot. Brown rot is not toxic, and some affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera, including November moth, willow beauty and short-cloaked moth.

The taste of the plum fruit ranges from sweet to tart; the skin itself may be particularly tart.  It is juicy and can be eaten fresh or used in jam-making or other recipes. Plum juice can be fermented into plum wine. In central England, a cider-like alcoholic beverage known as plum jerkum is made from plums. Dried, salted plums are used as a snack, sometimes known as saladito or salao. Various flavors of dried plum are available at Chinese grocers and specialty stores worldwide. They tend to be much drier than the standard prune. Cream, ginseng, spicy, and salty are among the common varieties. Licorice is generally used to intensify the flavor of these plums and is used to make salty plum drinks and toppings for shaved ice or baobing. Pickled plums are another type of preserve available in Asia and international specialty stores. The Japanese variety, called umeboshi, is often used for rice balls, called onigiri or omusubi.  The ume, from which umeboshi are made, is more closely related, however, to the apricot than to the plum. In the Balkans, plum is converted into an alcoholic drink named slivovitz (plum brandy) (Serbian:  ljivovica). A large number of plums, of the Damson variety, are also grown in Hungary, where they are called szilva and are used to make lekvar (a plum paste jam), palinka (traditional fruit brandy), plum dumplings, and other foods.
As with many other members of the rose family, plum kernels contain cyanogenic glycosides, including amygdalin. Prune kernel oil is made from the fleshy inner part of the pit of the plum. Though not available commercially, the wood of plum trees is used by hobbyists and other private woodworkers for musical instruments, knife handles, inlays, and similar small projects.","Erythema,[dsyn],12.90,C0041834|Natural Springs,[npop],12.95,C3179043|Weather,[npop],17.80,C0043085|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.88,C0682897|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.01,C0039336|Eating,[orgf],12.94,C0013470|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Paste substance,[sbst],3.48,C0030634|Wood material,[sbst],13.02,C0043217|Van der Woude syndrome,[dsyn],13.00,C0175697|"
"('jasmine flower', 'Cultivation and uses')","Widely cultivated for its flowers, jasmine is enjoyed in the garden, as a houseplant, and as cut flowers. The flowers are worn by women in their hair in South and South East Asia.Jasmine tea is often consumed in China, where it is called jasmine-flower tea (    ; pinyin: m  l  hu  ch ). Jasminum sambac flowers are also used to make jasmine tea, which often has a base of green tea or white tea, but sometimes an Oolong base is used.  The flowers are put in machines that control temperature and humidity. It takes about four hours for the tea to absorb the fragrance and flavour of the jasmine blossoms. For the highest grades of jasmine tea, this process may be repeated up to seven times. As the tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers, it must be refired to prevent spoilage. The used flowers may be removed from the final product, as the flowers contain no more aroma. Giant fans are used to blow away and remove the petals from the denser tea leaves.
In Okinawa, Japan, jasmine tea is known as sanpin cha. 
 Widely cultivated for its flowers, jasmine is enjoyed in the garden, as a houseplant, and as cut flowers. The flowers are worn by women in their hair in South and South East Asia.Jasmine gave name to the jasmonate plant hormones, as methyl jasmonate isolated from the oil of Jasminum grandiflorum led to the discovery of the molecular structure of jasmonates. Jasmonates occur ubiquitously across the plant kingdom, having key roles in responses to environmental cues, such as heat or cold stress, and participate in the signal transduction pathways of many plants. 
 Widely cultivated for its flowers, jasmine is enjoyed in the garden, as a houseplant, and as cut flowers.

The hybrid C.   californica is a tri-species hybrid (C.   superba   C. cathayensis). Numerous named cultivars of all of these hybrids are available in the horticultural trade.The species have become popular ornamental shrubs in parts of Europe and North America, grown in gardens both for their bright flowers and as a spiny barrier. Some cultivars grow up to 2 m tall, but others are much smaller and creeping. The fruits are hard and   although less astringent than quinces   are unpleasant to eat raw, tasting like an unripe apple with the acidity of a lemon, though they do soften and become less astringent after frost (via the process of bletting).  The fruits are suitable for making liqueurs, as well as marmalade and preserves, as they contain more pectin than apples and true quinces. The tree is suitable for cultivation as a bonsai.","Adult T-Cell Lymphoma/Leukemia,[neop],19.32,C0023493|Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma,[neop],19.32,C1961099|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.02,C0039336|Heartburn,[sosy],13.01,C0018834|Vertebral column,[bpoc],12.96,C0037949|Breeding,[orgf],9.86,C0006159|"

"('glossy privet fruit', 'Uses and cultivation')","In addition to being cultivated to create ornamental hedges and foliage, privet is also widely used in horticulture and flower arrangements. The Oval leaf privet Ligustrum ovalifolium is used for hedges, while its flexible twigs are sometimes used as cords for lashing. The tree species, especially Chinese privet is frequently used as a street tree in Europe, while other species including Ligustrum japonicum and Ligustrum quihoui are among the others also sometimes used as ornamental plants in gardens.
Privet became very popular in Britain as a replacement for ornamental railings around properties, which had been lost to the 1941 Government compulsorily requisitioning of all post-1850 iron gates and railings for the war effort  the idea being that the donated metal would be melted down for use in the manufacture of armaments in WWII, although this ultimately did not happen. The remaining stubbs of sawn-off railings can still be seen on many garden walls in the UK, often partly obscured by privet bushes.
Chinese privet is used in traditional herbal medicine. The decoction of privet leaves or bark helps to treat diarrhea, stomach ulcers, chronic bowel problems, chapped lips, sore mouths and throats, and a wash for skin problems. Privet leaves and bark have bitter properties that make a useful tea for improving appetite and digestion in chemotherapy patients.Some species produce a fruit, which is mildly toxic to humans. Symptoms from eating privet fruit include nausea, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure, and low body temperature. At least some privet species are known to be toxic to horses.","Cone-Rod Dystrophy 2,[dsyn],16.17,C3489532|Melting,[npop],16.26,C0599882|Vision,[orgf],16.14,C0042789|War,[acty],16.05,C0043027|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],45.86,C0007776|Diarrhea,[sosy],29.46,C0011991|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],26.83,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],26.83,C0022655|Gastric ulcer,[dsyn],20.95,C0038358|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Desire for food,[orgf],16.04,C0003618|Hypothermia, natural,[fndg],14.64,C0020672|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Digestion,[orgf],13.03,C0012238|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],11.49,C0031354|Intestines,[bpoc],9.78,C0021853|"
"('lotus root', 'Use')","The rhizomes of lotus are consumed as a vegetable in Asian countries, extensively in China and Japan: sold whole or in cut pieces, fresh, frozen, or canned. They are fried or cooked mostly in soups, soaked in syrup or pickled in vinegar (with sugar, chili and garlic). Lotus rhizomes have a crunchy texture with sweet-tangy flavours and are a classic dish at many banquets where they are deep-fried, stir-fried, or stuffed with meats or preserved fruits. Salads with prawns, sesame oil or coriander leaves are also popular. Unfortunately, fresh lotus root slices are limited by a fast browning rate. Lotus root tea is consumed in Korea.
Japan is one of the primary users of the rhizomes, representing about 1% of all vegetables consumed. Japan grows its own lotus but still must import 18,000 tons of lotus rhizome each year, of which China provides 15,000 tons yearly.Rhizomes contain high amounts of starch (31.2%) without characteristic taste or odour. The texture is comparable to a raw potato. The binding and disintegration properties of isolated Nelumbo starch have been compared with maize and potato starch; Nelumbo starch is shown to be superior as an adjuvant in the preparation of tablets. When dried, N. nucifera is also made into flour, another popular use of this vegetable. 
 Lotus pip tea is consumed in Korea. 
 Fresh lotus seeds (simplified Chinese:     ; traditional Chinese:     ; pinyin: xi n li nz ; Cantonese Yale: s n l hnj ) are nutritious but also vulnerable to microbial contamination, especially fungal infections. Therefore, mostly dry lotus seed-based products are found on the market. Traditional sun baking combining with charcoal processing dries the seeds but results in loss of nutrients. Freeze-dried lotus seeds have a longer shelf life and maintain original nutrients , while no differences in flavour are found after rehydration compared to fresh lotus seeds.Dry stored lotus seeds are sensitive to moisture and mold infestation; researchers continue to explore new ways to preserve fresh lotus seeds for example radiation processing.Lotus seeds can be processed into moon cake, lotus seed noodles and food in forms of paste, fermented milk, rice wine, ice cream, popcorn (phool makhana) and others, with lotus seeds as the main raw material. Traditional Eastern medicine claims that fresh lotus seed wine has thirst quenching, spleen healing and anti-diarrheal advantages after drinking, attributed to unspecified bioactive compounds. Lotus seed tea is consumed in Korea, and lotus embryo tea is consumed in China and Vietnam. 
 Young lotus stems are used as a salad ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine.
In South Indian states, the lotus stem is sliced, marinated with salt to dry, and the dried slices are fried and used as a side dish. In Kerala (in Malayalam ""    "") and Tamil Nadu, this end product is called "" Thamara Vathal"". 
 In China and Korea, lotus leaf tea (Chinese:     yeonipcha) is made from the leaves of the lotus. It is also used as a wrap for steaming rice and sticky rice and other steamed dishes in Southeast Asian cuisine, such as lo mai gai in Chinese cuisine or kao hor bai bua (Thai:             ), fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf in Thai cuisine. 
 In Korea, lotus flower tea (    yeonkkotcha) is made from the dried petals of the white lotus.
The stamens can be dried and made into a fragrant herbal tea (Chinese:     ; pinyin: li nhu  cha; Cantonese Yale: l hnf a chah), or used to impart a scent to tea leaves (particularly in Vietnam). This Vietnamese lotus tea is called tr  sen, ch  sen, or ch    p sen. 
 The petals, leaves and rhizome can also all be eaten raw, but there is a risk of parasite transmission (e.g., Fasciolopsis buski): it is therefore recommended that they be cooked before eating. 
 Nelumbo nucifera shows high potential for usage in wastewater treatment removing polluting compounds and heavy metals. It is able to grow in variable water conditions and in low light intensity. Various studies show the successful use of N. nucifera to counteract water eutrophication. The leaves of the floating lotus reduce sunlight reaching the lower part of the water.  This suppresses algae growth in N. nucifera aquatic systems and thus, the oxygen content is up to 20% higher than in other aquatic plant systems. Due to intense agricultural practices, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are major problems in aquatic systems. N. nucifera is able to assimilate a higher content of phosphorus than aquatic plants currently used for water remediation (such as water hyacinth). It also assimilates nitrogen (""denitrification"") and creates a habitat for bacterial growth in the water body. Through rhizofiltration, heavy metals   including arsenic, copper and cadmium   can be removed efficiently from the water. The results observed are impressive showing 96% of copper and 85% cadmium metals removed after a seven-day incubation period. The accumulation of heavy metals doesn't show morphological symptoms of metal toxicity; however, the rhizome quality for human consumption needs further study. 
 Currently most rhizomes are consumed fresh and it is not common to store them due to their poor shelf life performance. This limits export possibilities for low-income production countries in Asia. Rhizomes quickly lose water, oxidation occurs and nutrient composition changes within a short time after harvest. Optimal storage temperatures range between 5 to 8  C (41 to 46  F). There are three different approaches to storing rhizomes. By stacking the rhizomes, they are storable and remain fresh for about three weeks. Special stacking with silver sand and soil results in five to six layers that prevent water loss, thus the rhizome stays fresh for up to two months. However the method is not suitable for commercialization but rather for home use. Hydrogen sulfide fumigation reduces enzymatic browning and therefore ensures rhizome quality. Dipping the rhizomes in a salt solution prevents oxidation and bacterial reproduction, which allows storage for up to five months and a greater export ability. This treatment is related to high cost and inefficient cleaning process before eating the rhizomes. 
 Nelumbo nucifera contains some thermal-stable proteins that might be useful in protein bio engineering processes. The proteins are characterized by seed longevity used for cell protection and repair under stress.  There are also several indications that compounds of N. nucifera are used in drug fabrication in human health research for multiple purposes. 
 The distinctive dried seed heads, which resemble the spouts of watering cans, are widely sold throughout the world for decorative purposes and for dried flower arranging.
In Asia, the petals are sometimes used for garnish, while the large leaves are used as a wrap for food, not frequently eaten (for example, as a wrapper for zongzi).
A unique fabric from the lotus plant fibers is produced only at Inle lake, Myanmar and in Siem Reap (Cambodia) is used for weaving special robes for Buddha images called kya thingahn (lotus robe).","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],32.36,C0040452|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.18,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],17.80,C0016701|Fasting,[fndg],16.17,C0015663|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.16,C0020498|Odors,[npop],14.64,C0028884|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Desiccation,[npop],35.02,C0011682|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.21,C0682897|Sunlight,[npop],19.19,C0038817|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Spleen,[bpoc],16.08,C0037993|Drinking function,[orgf],16.05,C0684271|Alcohol consumption,[inbe],12.89,C0001948|Electromagnetic Radiation,[npop],12.88,C0034519|Diarrhea,[sosy],12.85,C0011991|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.92,C0043240|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|Mycoses,[dsyn],6.91,C0026946|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.74,C0020517|Radiation,[npop],6.57,C0851346|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.68,C0030499|Paste substance,[sbst],3.43,C0030634|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.18,C0020498|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.13,C0020498|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],26.05,C0221023|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Fragrance (odor),[npop],7.09,C2987717|Eating,[orgf],26.13,C0013470|disease transmission,[patf],9.74,C0242781|Drinking Water,[sbst],117.90,C0599638|Ability,[orga],29.46,C0085732|Growth,[orgf],19.70,C0018270|Intention - mental process,[menp],19.60,C0162425|Sunlight,[npop],19.27,C0038817|Light,[npop],16.18,C0023693|Denitrification,[phpr],14.64,C0598972|Body water (substance),[bdsu],11.49,C0005909|Eutrophication,[phpr],9.99,C0015191|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],9.74,C0274869|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.43,C0009830|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.43,C0599638|Soil,[sbst],14.64,C0037592|Ability,[orga],13.09,C0085732|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Solutions,[sbst],6.58,C0037633|Post-Translational Protein Processing,[moft],19.21,C0033666|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.90,C0043240|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|"

"('eupatorium herb', 'Uses')","Eupatorium are grown as ornamental plants, in particular in Asia. A number of popular ornamental plants formerly included in Eupatorium have been moved to other genera, such as Bartlettina and Conoclinium.
Tobacco leaf curl virus is a pathogen occasionally affecting plants of this genus. The foliage is eaten by some Lepidoptera larvae, including those of Orthonama obstipata (The Gem).The common names for the plants are all based on the previous usage of one species, Eupatorium perfoliatum, as an herbal medicine.  Despite its name, boneset is not used to treat broken bones, instead the common name apparently derives from the herb's use to treat dengue fever, which was also called breakbone fever because of the pain that it caused. The name thoroughwort also comes from Eupatorium perfoliatum, and refers to the perfoliate leaves, in which the stem appears to pierce the leaf (i.e. go through, note that in older usage ""thorough"" was not distinguished from ""through"", compare for example the word thoroughfare).
Boneset, although poisonous to humans and grazing livestock, has been used in folk medicine, for instance to excrete excess uric acid which causes gout.
Caution is advised when using boneset, since it contains toxic compounds that can cause liver damage.

"('foxnut seed', 'Uses')","The plant produces starchy white seeds that are edible.  The plant is cultivated for its seeds in lowland ponds in India, China, and Japan.  The Chinese have cultivated the plant for centuries. More than 96,000 hectares of Bihar, India, were set aside for cultivation of Euryale in 1990-1991. The plant grows best in locations with hot, dry summers and cold winters. Seeds are collected in the late summer and early autumn, and may be eaten raw or cooked.
In India, in the northern (Punjab) and western parts of the country, Euryale ferox seeds are often roasted or fried, which causes them to pop like popcorn. These are then eaten, often with a sprinkling of oil and spices. It is used in cooking, especially to make a porridge or pudding called kheer.
Evidence from archaeobotany indicates that Euryale ferox was a frequently collected wild food source during the Neolithic period in the Yangtze region, with large numbers of finds coming from the sites of Kuahuqiao, Hemudu, and Tianluoshan. The earliest recorded use of E. ferox was found in Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel, among artifacts of the Acheulean culture 790-750,000 years ago.The seeds are used in Cantonese soup.

"('chinese white olive', 'Uses and ecology')","Several species have edible nuts, known as galip nut or nangae (C. indicum), pili nut (C. ovatum), or simply canarium nut (C. harveyi and C. indicum). C. indicum are among the most important nut-bearing trees in eastern Indonesia and the Southwest Pacific. C. ovatum is cultivated as a food crop only in the Philippines.

C. odontophyllum, known commonly as dabai or kembayau, is a species with a nutritious fruit with a creamy taste. It is hard when raw and may be pickled or softened with hot water when prepared. Many animals feed on the fruit in the wild, such as the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the ruffed lemurs (Varecia) of Madagascar's eastern tropical forests.
Canarium album produces a fruit consumed in Vietnam, Thailand (where it is known as nam liap (Thai:          ), samo chin (Thai:       ) or kana (Thai:      )) and in China (Chinese:   ) with an appearance of a big olive.
Canarium luzonicum, commonly known as elemi, is a tree native to the Philippines. An oleoresin, which contains Elemicin, is harvested from it.

"('sweet wormwood herb', 'Medicinal uses')","In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), A. annua is traditionally used to treat fever. Due to duplication in ancient TCM scriptures, A. annua is more commonly referred to as qinghao (Chinese:   ; pinyin: q ngh o), the modern Chinese name for Artemisia carvifolia, as opposed to its current Chinese name huanghuahao. Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China defines qinghao in TCM as ""dried aboveground parts of A. annua"". 
 The proposed mechanism of action of artemisinin involves cleavage of endoperoxide bridges by iron, producing free radicals (hypervalent iron-oxo species, epoxides, aldehydes, and dicarbonyl compounds) which damage biological macromolecules causing oxidative stress in the cells of the parasite.  Malaria is caused by apicomplexans, primarily Plasmodium falciparum, which largely reside in red blood cells and itself contains iron-rich heme-groups (in the form of hemozoin). In 2015 artemisinin was shown to bind to a large number targets suggesting that it acts in a promiscuous manner. 
 In 1971, scientists demonstrated the plant extracts had antimalarial activity in primate models, and in 1972, the active ingredient, artemisinin (formerly referred to as arteannuin), was isolated and its chemical structure described. Artemisinin may be extracted using a low boiling point solvent, such as diethylether, and is found in the glandular trichomes of the leaves, stems, and inflorescences, and it is concentrated in the upper portions of plant within new growth. The first isolation of artemisinin from the herb occurred from a military project known as Project 523, following the study of traditional medicine pharmacopoeias performed by Tu Youyou and other researchers within the project. 
 Apart from the active compound Artemisinin, recent studies show that A. annua is one of the four medical plants with the highest Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) level.Artemisia annua  possesses the capacity to produce high phenolic compounds, which result in high antioxidant activity. Five major groups (coumarins, flavones, flavonols, phenolic acids and miscellaneous) containing over 50 different phenolic compounds were identified analyzing A. annua.Flavonoids are generally known for their redox properties involved in the delay or inhibition of the initiation or propagation in oxidizing chain reactions.Even though the beneficial effect of these phenolic compounds on a great number of diseases is often discussed, different studies show beneficial effects of flavonoids compound produced by A. annua. It has been stated that there is a negative correlation between the presence of the mentioned components and cardiovascular diseases, cancer and parasitic disease such as malaria. 
 In the last 20 years researchers focused on the activity of artemisinin against malaria. Therefore, fewer studies have been done about the relationship between flavonoids and cancer. Despite that, recent studies show that the flavonoids present in the A. annua leaf are linked to suppression of CYP450 enzymes responsible for altering the absorption and metabolism of artemisinin in the body. Further researches in the synergistic effect of artemisinin and flavonoids and their biological interaction between malaria and cancer are needed. 
 Research to develop antimalarial drugs led to the discovery of artemisinin, a compound which is extracted from Artemisia annua, in the 1970s by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, for which she shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. While most TCM herbs are boiled at high temperature that can damage the active ingredient in Artemisia annua, one traditional source says that this herb is to be steeped in cold water; knowing this, scientists found that a better extract was obtained by using a low-temperature ether-based extraction method. Purification processes were used to isolate the active molecule, and clinical trials showed the active ingredient to be an effective drug.Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge and has been produced semisynthetically as an antimalarial drug. The efficacy of tea, made with either water or urine and A. annua, for the treatment of malaria is dubious, and is discouraged by the WHO. Research has found that artemesinin is not soluble in water and the concentrations in these infusions are considered insufficient to treat malaria. In 2004, the Ethiopian Ministry of Health changed Ethiopia's first line antimalaria drug from sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar), which has an average 36% treatment failure rate, to artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), a drug therapy containing artemesinin which is 100% effective when used correctly, despite a worldwide shortage at the time of the needed derivative from A. annua. A 2012 review said that artemisinin-based remedies are the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria. A 2013 review suggested that although Artemisia annua may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Although WHO recommends artemisinin-based remedies for treating uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance can no longer be ignored. The causes that affected the emergence of artemisinin resistance include, for example, the use of artemisinin-based remedies. Encouraging herbal alternatives are in the pipeline, but the only indelible solution for the eradication of malaria would be for the creation of an effective vaccination. Emergence of artemisinin resistance has been identified in Cambodia and the border of Thailand. It will likely spread to other endemic areas across the world in the impending future. As of 2013, it seems that the pathogenic agent of malaria is becoming resistant to artemisinin-based drugs.","Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Erythrocytes,[cell],13.14,C0014792|Cytokinesis,[celf],13.05,C0010813|Malaria,[dsyn],11.49,C0024530|Oxidative Stress,[comd],9.88,C0242606|Cells,[cell],3.42,C0007634|Trichomes,[bpoc],13.01,C3658255|Neoplasms,[neop],5.18,C0027651|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.03,C0021467|Oxidation-Reduction,[moft],9.87,C0030012|Reproduction,[orgf],9.82,C0035150|Malaria,[dsyn],9.74,C0024530|Disease,[dsyn],9.74,C0012634|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],5.18,C0007222|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],5.18,C0006826|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.61,C0030499|Malaria,[dsyn],19.92,C0024530|Biological Absorption,[orgf],14.64,C2347023|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],10.42,C0006826|Metabolism,[orgf],3.59,C0025519|Malaria,[dsyn],76.07,C0024530|Drinking Water,[sbst],68.40,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],45.15,C0009264|treatment failure,[fndg],22.57,C0162643|Hyperlipidemia,[dsyn],17.80,C0020473|Fever,[sosy],13.10,C0015967|Pregnancy,[orgf],13.05,C0032961|Common Cold,[dsyn],13.03,C0009443|Creativity,[menp],12.93,C0010297|Eye,[bpoc],12.85,C0015392|Urine,[bdsu],11.49,C0042036|Affect (mental function),[menp],10.28,C0001721|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.88,C0041912|Solutions,[sbst],6.70,C0037633|Pathogenicity,[orga],6.54,C1136169|Mental concentration,[menp],3.56,C0086045|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|"

 Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.Although ginseng is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, concerns have been raised about manufactured ginseng products containing toxic metals or filler materials, such as rice or wheat.In 2012, Chinese health regulators reclassified ginseng root as a dietary herb that can be used in health foods without prior approval, as long as no specific health claims are made for it; previously, it had been classified as an herbal drug whose inclusion in health foods required prior approval and licensing . Ginseng-infused teas and energy drinks are consumed today in China and neighboring countries as a kind of tonic for vitality, especially by men 50 and older, who might use them on a daily basis.

"('ginseng leaf', 'Safety and side effects')","Ginseng generally has a good safety profile and the incidence of adverse effects are minor when used over the short term. Concerns exist when ginseng is used chronically, potentially causing side effects such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems.The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescription medications is believed to be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with the blood thinner warfarin. Ginseng also has adverse drug reactions with phenelzine, and a potential interaction has been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine. Other side effects may include feeling anxious, insomnia, fluctuations in blood pressure, breast pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, or diarrhea. If taken with other herbal supplements, ginseng may interact with them or with prescribed medicines or foods.The common ginsengs (P. ginseng and P. quinquefolia) are generally considered to be relatively safe even in large amounts.

"('nutmeg', 'Culinary uses')","Nutmeg and mace have similar sensory qualities, with nutmeg having a slightly sweeter and mace a more delicate flavour. Mace is often preferred in light dishes for the bright orange, saffron-like hue it imparts. Nutmeg is used for flavouring many dishes, and nowadays is mostly found in Western supermarkets in ground or grated form. Whole nutmeg can also be ground at home using  a grater specifically designed for nutmeg or a multi-purpose grating tool.In Indonesian cuisine, nutmeg is used in various dishes, mainly in many spicy soups, such as some variant of soto, konro, oxtail soup, sup iga (ribs soup), bakso and sup kambing. It is also used in gravy for meat dishes, such as semur beef stew, ribs with tomato, and European derived dishes such as bistik (beef steak), rolade (minced meat roll) and bistik lidah (beef tongue steak).
In Indian cuisine, nutmeg is used in many sweet, as well as savoury, dishes (predominantly in Mughlai cuisine). In Kerala Malabar region, grated nutmeg is used in meat preparations and also sparingly added to desserts for the flavour. It may also be used in small quantities in garam masala. Ground nutmeg is also smoked in India.In traditional European cuisine, nutmeg and mace are used especially in potato dishes and in processed meat products; they are also used in soups, sauces, and baked goods. It is also commonly used in rice pudding. In Dutch cuisine, nutmeg is added to vegetables such as Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and string beans. Nutmeg is a traditional ingredient in mulled cider, mulled wine, and eggnog.  In Scotland, mace and nutmeg are usually both ingredients in haggis. In Italian cuisine, nutmeg is used as part of the stuffing for many regional meat-filled dumplings like tortellini, as well as for the traditional meatloaf. 
Nutmeg is a common spice for pumpkin pie and in recipes for other winter squashes, such as baked acorn squash. In the Caribbean, nutmeg is often used in drinks, such as the Bushwacker, Painkiller, and Barbados rum punch. Typically, it is a sprinkle on top of the drink. 
 The pericarp (fruit covering) is used to make jam, or is finely sliced, cooked with sugar, and crystallised to make a fragrant candy. Sliced nutmeg fruit flesh is made as manisan (sweets), either wet, which is seasoned in sugary syrup liquid, or dry coated with sugar, a dessert called manisan pala in Indonesia. In Penang cuisine, dried, shredded nutmeg rind with sugar coating is used as toppings on the uniquely Penang ais kacang. Nutmeg rind is also blended (creating a fresh, green, tangy taste and white colour juice) or boiled (resulting in a much sweeter and brown juice) to make iced nutmeg juice. In Kerala Malabar region of India, it is used for juice, pickles and chutney.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],85.17,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.95,C0682897|Bone structure of rib,[bpoc],32.51,C0035561|Light,[npop],16.18,C0023693|Multiple Chronic Conditions,[dsyn],16.08,C3266262|Tongue,[bpoc],12.94,C0040408|Esthesia,[ortf],9.71,C0036658|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.76,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],20.95,C0682897|Desiccation,[npop],20.98,C0011682|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.45,C2987717|"
"('nutmeg', 'Adverse effects')","In the 19th century, nutmeg was thought to be an abortifacient, which led to numerous recorded cases of nutmeg poisoning. Although used as a folk treatment for other ailments, nutmeg has no proven medicinal value. In amounts exceeding its usual use as a spice, nutmeg may interact with anxiolytic drugs, produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or evoke acute episodes of psychosis.","Contact Dermatitis,[dsyn],13.22,C0011616|Lead Poisoning,[inpo],13.01,C0023176|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Psychotic Disorders,[mobd],9.75,C0033975|Allergic Reaction,[patf],8.34,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],8.34,C0020517|"
"('nutmeg', 'Psychoactivity and toxicity')","In low doses, nutmeg produces no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in large doses, both raw nutmeg freshly ground from kernels, as well as nutmeg oil, have psychoactive effects, which appear to derive from anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin. Myristicin a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and psychoactive substance can induce convulsions, palpitations, nausea, eventual dehydration, and generalized body pain when consumed in large amounts. Nutmeg poisonings occur by accidental consumption in children and by intentional abuse with other drugs in teenagers.Varying considerably from person to person, nutmeg intoxication may occur with side effects, such as delirium, anxiety, confusion, headaches, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, eye irritation, or amnesia. Intoxication takes several hours before maximum effect is experienced. The effects of nutmeg intoxication may last for several days.Although rarely reported, nutmeg overdose can result in death, especially if combined with other drugs.  Rates of fatal poisoning from nutmeg or myristicin individually are uncommon. 
 Nutmeg was once considered an abortifacient, but may be safe for culinary use during pregnancy if used only in flavoring amounts. However, if consumed in large quantities, it contains hallucinogens that may affect the fetus, and consequently nutmeg is recommended for avoidance during pregnancy. 
 While the spicy scent of nutmeg may be attractive to pets, there is potential for toxicity if large amounts are consumed.","Nausea,[sosy],29.46,C0027497|Amnesia,[mobd],20.95,C0002622|Delirium,[mobd],20.95,C0011206|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Drug Overdose,[inpo],16.30,C0029944|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Xerostomia,[fndg],14.64,C0043352|Poisoning,[inpo],13.45,C0032343|Dehydration,[dsyn],13.14,C0011175|Pain,[sosy],13.09,C0030193|Eye,[bpoc],12.96,C0015392|Anxiety,[mobd],11.49,C0003467|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.90,C0011065|Accidents,[phpr],9.88,C0000924|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.81,C0162425|Anxiety Disorders,[mobd],8.34,C0003469|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|Drug abuse,[mobd],3.57,C0013146|Pregnancy,[orgf],29.46,C0032961|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Fetal Tissue,[tisu],8.34,C0242291|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.56,C2987717|"
"('cinnamon bark', 'Food uses')","Cinnamon bark is used as a spice. It is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material. It is used in the preparation of chocolate, especially in Mexico. Cinnamon is often used in savoury dishes of chicken and lamb. In the United States, cinnamon and sugar are often used to flavour cereals, bread-based dishes, such as toast, and fruits, especially apples; a cinnamon-sugar mixture is sold separately for such purposes.  It is also used in Turkish cuisine for both sweet and savoury dishes.  Cinnamon can also be used in pickling and Christmas drinks such as eggnog.

Coumarin is known to cause liver and kidney damage in high concentrations and metabolic effect in humans with CYP2A6 polymorphism. Based on this assessment, the European Union set a guideline for maximum coumarin content in foodstuffs of 50 mg per kg of dough in seasonal foods, and 15 mg per kg in everyday baked foods. According to the maximum recommended TDI of 0.1 mg of coumarin per kg of body weight, which is 5 mg of coumarin for a body weight of 50 kg:

Due to the variable amount of coumarin in C. cassia, usually well over 1.0 mg of coumarin per g of cinnamon and sometimes up to 12 times that, C. cassia has a low safe intake level upper limit to adhere to the above TDI.

"('mulberry bark', 'Uses')","This plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine.Paper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (tapa in most Polynesian languages). Barkcloth can also be made from other members of the mulberry family (Moraceae), including Ficus (figs) and Artocarpus. Barkcloth was also occasionally made from Pipturus nettles, especially in Hawaii. However, the highest quality of barkcloth was from paper mulberry.Barkcloth was mainly used for clothing among ancient Austronesians and is traditionally made using characteristic stone or wooden beaters, which are among the most common artifacts found in Austronesian archaeological sites. Numerous archaeological remains of barkcloth beaters in southern China have been regarded as evidence that the pre-Taiwan Austronesian homelands were located in the region prior to the southward expansion of the Han Dynasty, particularly around the Pearl River Delta. The oldest such remains are from the Dingmo Site in Guangxi, dated to around 7,900 BP. Barkcloth remained an important source of clothing fabrics in pre-colonial Melanesia, Polynesia, and parts of Indonesia. However, it has been mostly replaced by woven fiber clothing in most of Island Southeast Asia and Micronesia. It is still worn ceremonially in parts of Polynesia and Melanesia. It is also used to make bags and bedding.Although numerous names are used for paper mulberry throughout Austronesia, none are cognates, thus a Proto-Oceanic term cannot be reconstructed. In most of Polynesia, the term for barkcloth can be reconstructed from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian *taba, meaning ""bark"", with cognates including Wayan taba; Tongan, Samoan, Mangareva, and Rarotongan tapa; and Hawaiian kapa. Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word *siapo, with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan hiapo; and Samoan and East Futunan siapo. The term for barkcloth beater, however, can be reconstructed more extensively back to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *ike, with cognates including Uma ike; Sa'a iki; Bauan, Tongan, and East Futunan ike; and Samoan and Hawaiian i e. 
 This plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine.It is a significant fiber crop in the history of paper. It was used for papermaking in China by around 100 AD. It was used to make washi in Japan by 600 AD. Washi, a Japanese handcrafted paper, is made with the inner bark, which is pounded and mixed with water to produce a paste, which is dried into sheets. 
 This plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine.The wood of the plant is useful for making furniture and utensils, and the roots can be used as rope. The fruit and cooked leaves are edible.The fruit, leaves, and bark have been used in systems of traditional medicine. For example, the bark and fruit of the species, known locally as jangli toot, are used as a laxative and antipyretic in rural Pakistan.The species is used as an ornamental plant. It tolerates disturbance and air pollution, so it has been useful as a landscaping plant on roadsides. It is a pioneer species that easily fills forest clearings, and it has been considered for reforestation efforts.

These colors are water-soluble and easily extractable, yielding natural food colorants. Due to a growing demand for natural food colorants, their significance in the food industry is increasing.
A cheap and industrially feasible method has been developed to extract anthocyanins from mulberry fruit that could be used as a fabric dye or food colorant of high color value (above 100). Scientists found that, of 31 Chinese mulberry cultivars tested, the total anthocyanin yield varied from 148 to 2725 mg/l of fruit juice. All the sugars, acids, and vitamins of the fruit remained intact in the residual juice after removal of the anthocyanins, so the juice could be used to produce juice, wine, and sauce.
Anthocyanin content depends on climate and area of cultivation, and is particularly high in sunny climates.

"('sea buckthorn fruit', 'Uses')","Sea buckthorn berries are edible and nutritious, though astringent, sour, and oily  unless 'bletted' (frosted to reduce the astringency) and/or mixed as a drink with sweeter substances such as apple or grape juice. Additionally, malolactic fermentation of sea buckthorn juice reduces sourness, enhancing its sensory properties. The mechanism behind this change is transformation of malic acid into lactic acid in microbial metabolism.When the berries are pressed, the resulting sea buckthorn juice separates into three layers: on top is a thick, orange cream; in the middle, a layer containing sea buckthorn's characteristic high content of saturated and polyunsaturated fats; and the bottom layer is sediment and juice. Containing fat sources applicable for cosmetic purposes, the upper two layers can be processed for skin creams and liniments, whereas the bottom layer can be used for edible products such as syrup.Besides juice, sea buckthorn fruit can be used to make pies, jams, lotions, teas, fruit wines, and liquors. The juice or pulp has other potential applications in foods, beverages, or cosmetics products. Fruit drinks were among the earliest sea buckthorn products developed in China. Sea buckthorn-based juice is common in Germany and Scandinavian countries. It provides a beverage rich in vitamin C and carotenoids.For its troops confronting low winter temperatures (see Siachen), India's Defence Research Development Organization established a factory in Leh to manufacture a multivitamin herbal beverage based on sea buckthorn juice.The seed and pulp oils have nutritional properties that vary under different processing methods. Sea buckthorn oils are used as a source for ingredients in several commercially available cosmetic products and nutritional supplements. 
 Sea buckthorn may be used as a landscaping shrub with an aggressive basal shoot system used for barrier hedges and windbreaks, and to stabilize riverbanks and steep slopes. They have value in northern climates for their landscape qualities, as the colorful berry clusters are retained through winter. Branches may be used by florists for designing ornaments.
In northwestern China, sea buckthorn shrubs have been planted on the bottoms of dry riverbeds to increase water retention of the soil, thus decreasing sediment loss. Because of increased moisture conservation of the soil and nitrogen-fixing capabilities of sea buckthorn, vegetation levels have increased in areas where sea buckthorn have been planted. Sea buckthorn was once distributed free of charge to Canadian prairie farmers by PFRA to be used in shelterbelts.","Dental Pulp,[bpoc],35.81,C0011399|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.71,C0009264|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],14.64,C0424320|Fermentation,[moft],13.01,C0015852|Amniotic Fluid,[bdsu],10.28,C0002638|Esthesia,[ortf],9.76,C0036658|Metabolism,[orgf],3.43,C0025519|Climate,[npop],16.05,C0008946|Aggressive behavior,[inbe],12.93,C0001807|Soil,[sbst],25.93,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Retention (Psychology),[menp],16.18,C0035280|Desiccation,[npop],9.86,C0011682|"

"('amomum fruit', 'Uses')","The dogwood family is desired for ornamental uses in landscapes across the United States. Dogwoods are valued by gardeners for their spring flowers, summer foliage, fruit and leaf color. Each species of dogwood has their own unique look, Cornus amomum is a shrub which can be used in places of excess runoff or areas of water collection in a landscape as it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. The shrub provides beautiful colors throughout the spring, summer and fall. Cornus amomum has also been used in the outdoors to help with erosion control along slopes and steep inclines, it can be planted by farmers and landowners to provide a windbreaks for homes and agriculture fields, its uses can include building natural borders between land and for wildlife conservation, and it can be used to provide habitat for many types of wildlife. Finally, Cornus amomum can minimize stream bank erosion and add stabilization along bank when coupled together with other well rooted trees and shrubs like willows. Some problems can arise from the use of Cornus amomum as a natural border, mostly as a border for wildlife and livestock. While the shrubs create a useful barrier, grazing wildlife and livestock tend to damage much of the shrub when the fruit are ripe. Other than that, there are no impending diseases or pest which would pose any sort of problem for the shrub.","Natural Springs,[npop],25.90,C3179043|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Plague,[dsyn],20.95,C0032064|Disease,[dsyn],20.04,C0012634|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.10,C0040452|Streams,[npop],16.09,C0442540|Soil,[sbst],12.96,C0037592|"

"('yam', 'Toxicity')","Unlike cassava, most varieties of edible, mature, cultivated yam do not contain toxic compounds. However, there are exceptions. Bitter compounds tend to accumulate in immature tuber tissues of white and yellow yams. These may be polyphenols or tannin-like compounds.Wild forms of bitter yams (Dioscorea dumetorum) do contain some toxins, such as dihydrodioscorine, that taste bitter, hence are referred to as bitter yam. Bitter yams are not normally eaten except at times of desperation in poor countries and in times of local food scarcity. They are usually detoxified by soaking in a vessel of salt water, in cold or hot fresh water or in a stream. The bitter compounds in these yams are water-soluble alkaloids which, on ingestion, produce severe and distressing symptoms. Severe cases of alkaloid intoxication may prove fatal.
Aerial or potato yams have antinutritional factors. In Asia, detoxification methods, involving water extraction, fermentation, and roasting of the grated tuber, are used for bitter cultivars of this yam. The bitter compounds in yams also known locally as air potato include diosbulbin and possibly saponins, such as diosgenin. In Indonesia, an extract of air potato is used in the preparation of arrow poison.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.01,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],24.11,C0009264|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.40,C2350229|Streams,[npop],16.18,C0442540|Metabolic Detoxication, Drug,[orgf],16.17,C0025516|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Taste Perception,[ortf],14.64,C0039336|Fresh Water,[sbst],13.22,C0016710|Eating,[orgf],13.06,C0013470|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],11.49,C0041912|Blood Vessel,[bpoc],6.71,C0005847|Body tissue,[tisu],3.55,C0040300|Air (substance),[sbst],32.35,C0001861|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.43,C0599638|Metabolic Detoxication, Drug,[orgf],16.12,C0025516|Fermentation,[moft],14.64,C0015852|"
"('hawthorn berry', 'Uses')","The ""haws"" or fruits of the common hawthorn, C. monogyna, are edible, but the flavor has been compared to over-ripe apples. In the United Kingdom, they are sometimes used to make a jelly or homemade wine.  The leaves are edible, and if picked in spring when still young, are tender enough to be used in salads. The young leaves and flower buds, which are also edible, are known as ""bread and cheese"" in rural England. In the southern United States, fruits of three native species are collectively known as mayhaws and are made into jellies which are considered a delicacy. The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used red and black hawthorn fruit for food.
On Manitoulin Island, Ontario, some red-fruited species are called hawberries. During the pioneer days, white settlers ate these fruits during the winter as the only remaining food supply. People born on the island are now called ""haweaters"".
The fruits of Crataegus mexicana are known in Mexico as tejocotes and are eaten raw, cooked, or in jam during the winter. They are stuffed in the pi atas broken during the traditional pre-Christmas celebration known as Las Posadas. They are also cooked with other fruits to prepare a Christmas punch. The mixture of tejocote paste, sugar, and chili powder produces a popular Mexican candy called rielitos, which is manufactured by several brands.
The fruits of the species Crataegus pinnatifida (Chinese hawthorn) are tart, bright red, and resemble small crabapple fruits. They are used to make many kinds of Chinese snacks, including haw flakes and tanghulu. The fruits, which are called    sh n zh  in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, alcoholic beverages, and other drinks; these could in turn be used in other dishes (for instance, many older recipes for Cantonese sweet and sour sauce call for sh nzh  jam). In South Korea, a liquor called sansachun is made from the fruits.
In Iran, the fruits of Crataegus (including Crataegus azarolus var. aronia, as well as other species) are known as z lz lak and eaten raw as a snack, or made into a jam known by the same name. 
 A 2008 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis of previous studies concluded that evidence exists of ""a significant benefit in symptom control and physiologic outcomes"" for an extract of hawthorn used as an adjuvant in treating chronic heart failure. A 2010 review concluded that ""Crataegus [hawthorn] preparations hold significant potential as a useful remedy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease"". The review indicated the need for further study of the best dosages and concluded that although ""many different theoretical interactions between Crataegus and orthodox medications have been postulated ... none have [yet] been substantiated.Phytochemicals found in hawthorn include tannins, flavonoids,  oligomeric proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. 
 Several species of hawthorn have been used in traditional medicine. The products used are often derived from C. monogyna, C. laevigata, or related Crataegus species, ""collectively known as hawthorn"", not necessarily distinguishing between these species. The dried fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida (called sh n zh  in Chinese) are used in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as a digestive aid. A closely related species, Crataegus cuneata (Japanese hawthorn, called sanzashi in Japanese) is used in a similar manner. Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in herbal medicine where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function.The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used black hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: ka a; approximate pronunciation: kasha) for food, and red hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language:  up i; approximate pronunciation: shupshi) in traditional medicine.Overdose can cause cardiac arrhythmia and low blood pressure, while milder side effects include nausea and dizziness. Patients taking digoxin should avoid taking hawthorn. 
 Many species and hybrids are used as ornamental and street trees. The common hawthorn is extensively used in Europe as a hedge plant. During the British Agricultural Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, hawthorn saplings were mass propagated in nurseries to create the new field boundaries required by the Inclosure Acts. Several cultivars of the Midland hawthorn C. laevigata have been selected for their pink or red flowers. Hawthorns are among the trees most recommended for water conservation landscapes. 
 Hawthorn can be used as a rootstock in the practice of grafting. It is graft-compatible with Mespilus (medlar), and with pear, and makes a hardier rootstock than quince, but the thorny suckering habit of the hawthorn can be problematic.Seedlings of Crataegus monogyna have been used to graft multiple species on the same trunk, such as pink hawthorn, pear tree, and medlar, the result being trees which give pink and white flowers in May and fruits during the summer. ""Chip budding"" has also been performed on hawthorn trunks to have branches of several varieties on the same tree. Such trees can be seen in Vigo, Spain, and in the northwest of France (mainly in Brittany). 
 Many species of Hawthorn make excellent bonsai trees. They are grown and enjoyed for their display of flowers. 
 The wood of some Crataegus species is hard and resistant to rot. In rural North America, it was prized for use as tool handles and fence posts. First Nations people of western Canada used the thorns for durable fish hooks and minor skin surgeries.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],20.95,C0682897|Natural Springs,[npop],12.97,C3179043|Ataxia Telangiectasia,[dsyn],24.11,C0004135|Childbirth,[orgf],16.18,C1148523|Ataxia Telangiectasia,[dsyn],22.48,C0004135|Eating,[orgf],12.92,C0013470|Paste substance,[sbst],3.43,C0030634|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.15,C0020498|Amniotic Fluid,[bdsu],9.78,C0002638|Lymphokine-Activated Killer Cells,[cell],25.64,C0022687|Eating,[orgf],12.87,C0013470|Congestive heart failure,[dsyn],3.81,C0018802|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],3.45,C0007222|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Drug Overdose,[inpo],17.80,C0029944|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Digestion,[orgf],13.02,C0012238|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],11.49,C0003811|Conduction disorder of the heart,[dsyn],11.49,C0264886|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena,[ortf],8.34,C0007227|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],14.64,C1096155|Transplanted tissue,[tisu],20.38,C0332835|Vision,[orgf],16.17,C0042789|Behaviorial Habits,[inbe],9.86,C0018464|Wood material,[sbst],13.01,C0043217|"

It has an acidic flavor which is best described as a mixture of cranberry and sour cherry; it is mainly used for making jam, makes an excellent sauce similar to cranberry sauce when pitted, and then boiled with sugar and orange, but also can be eaten dried. 
In Azerbaijan and Armenia, the fruit is used for distilling vodka, in Austria and German Alps is used for distilling Dirndlbrand, in Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina it is distilled into rakia. In Turkey and Iran, it is eaten with salt as a snack in summer, and traditionally drunk in a cold drink called k z lc k  erbeti. Cultivars selected for fruit production in Ukraine have fruit up to four cm long.  It is eaten in Eastern Europe in many ways including as a traditional medicine.The fruit of C. mas (together with the fruit of C. officinalis) has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine in which it is known as sh nzh y ,     and used to retain the jing. 
 The species is also grown as an ornamental plant for its late winter yellow flowers, which open earlier than those of Forsythia. While Cornus mas flowers are not as large and vibrant as those of the Forsythia, the entire plant can be used for a similar effect in the landscape. 
 The wood of C. mas is extremely dense and, unlike the wood of most other woody plant species, sinks in water. This density makes it valuable for crafting into tool handles, parts for machines, etc.Cornus mas was used from the seventh century BC onward by Greek craftsmen to construct spears, javelins and bows, the craftsmen considering it far superior to any other wood. The wood's association with weaponry was so well known that the Greek name for it was used as a synonym for ""spear"" in poetry during the fourth and third centuries BC.In Italy, the mazzarella, uncino or bastone, the stick carried by the butteri or mounted herdsmen of the Maremma region, is traditionally made of cornel-wood, there called crognolo or grugnale, dialect forms of Italian: corniolo.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.45,C0682897|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|Van der Woude syndrome,[dsyn],13.44,C0175697|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|furuncle,[dsyn],3.55,C0242301|Eating,[orgf],26.17,C0013470|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.46,C0009264|Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome,[dsyn],13.14,C1328840|Alcoholic Intoxication,[mobd],13.00,C0001969|Common Cold,[dsyn],13.00,C0009443|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],12.89,C1096155|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.85,C0041912|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],12.94,C1096155|Wood material,[sbst],84.07,C0043217|Macrophage Activation Syndrome,[dsyn],26.11,C1096155|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.51,C0599638|Mental association,[menp],13.02,C0004083|Carrying,[acty],9.88,C0206243|"

Ginger is a fragrant kitchen spice. Young ginger rhizomes are juicy and fleshy with a mild taste. They are often pickled in vinegar or sherry as a snack or cooked as an ingredient in many dishes. They can be steeped in boiling water to make ginger herb tea, to which honey may be added. Ginger can be made into candy or ginger wine.
Mature ginger rhizomes are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.
Fresh ginger can be substituted for ground ginger at a ratio of six to one, although the flavors of fresh and dried ginger are somewhat different. Powdered dry ginger root is typically used as a flavoring for recipes such as gingerbread, cookies, crackers and cakes, ginger ale, and ginger beer. Candied ginger or crystallized ginger, known in the U.K. as ""stem ginger"", is the root cooked in sugar until soft, and is a type of confectionery. Fresh ginger may be peeled before eating. For longer-term storage, the ginger can be placed in a plastic bag and refrigerated or frozen.In Indian cuisine, ginger is a key ingredient, especially in thicker gravies, as well as in many other dishes, both vegetarian and meat-based. Ginger has a role in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. It is an ingredient in traditional Indian drinks, both cold and hot, including spiced masala chai. Fresh ginger is one of the main spices used for making pulse and lentil curries and other vegetable preparations. Fresh ginger together with peeled garlic cloves is crushed or ground to form ginger garlic masala. Fresh, as well as dried, ginger is used to spice tea and coffee, especially in winter. In south India, ""sambharam"" is a summer yogurt drink made with ginger as a key ingredient, along with green chillies, salt and curry leaves. Ginger powder is used in food preparations intended primarily for pregnant or nursing women, the most popular one being katlu, which is a mixture of gum resin, ghee, nuts, and sugar. Ginger is also consumed in candied and pickled form. In Japan, ginger is pickled to make beni sh ga and gari or grated and used raw on tofu or noodles. It is made into a candy called shoga no sato zuke. In the traditional Korean kimchi, ginger is either finely minced or just juiced to avoid the fibrous texture and added to the ingredients of the spicy paste just before the fermenting process. 
In Burma, ginger is called gyin. It is widely used in cooking and as a main ingredient in traditional medicines. It is  consumed as a salad dish called gyin-thot, which consists of shredded ginger preserved in oil, with a variety of nuts and seeds. In Thailand' where it is called     khing, it is used to make a ginger garlic paste in cooking. In Indonesia, a beverage called wedang jahe is made from ginger and palm sugar. Indonesians also use ground ginger root, called jahe, as a common ingredient in local recipes. In Malaysia, ginger is called halia and used in many kinds of dishes, especially soups. Called luya in the Philippines, ginger is a common ingredient in local dishes and is brewed as a tea called salabat. In Vietnam, the fresh leaves, finely chopped, can be added to shrimp-and-yam soup (canh khoai m ) as a top garnish and spice to add a much subtler flavor of ginger than the chopped root. In China, sliced or whole ginger root is often paired with savory dishes such as fish, and chopped ginger root is commonly paired with meat, when it is cooked. Candied ginger is sometimes a component of Chinese candy boxes, and a herbal tea can be prepared from ginger. Raw ginger juice can be used to set milk and make a desert, ginger milk curd.
In the Caribbean, ginger is a popular spice for cooking and for making drinks such as sorrel, a drink made during the Christmas season. Jamaicans make ginger beer both as a carbonated beverage and also fresh in their homes. Ginger tea is often made from fresh ginger, as well as the famous regional specialty Jamaican ginger cake. On the island of Corfu, Greece, a traditional drink called             (tsitsibira), a type of ginger beer, is made. The people of Corfu and the rest of the Ionian islands adopted the drink from the British, during the period of the United States of the Ionian Islands.
In Western cuisine, ginger is traditionally used mainly in sweet foods such as ginger ale, gingerbread, ginger snaps, parkin, and speculaas. A ginger-flavored liqueur called Canton is produced in Jarnac, France. Ginger wine is a ginger-flavored wine produced in the United Kingdom, traditionally sold in a green glass bottle.

High doses of black cohosh may cause nausea, dizziness, visual effects, a lower heart rate, and increased perspiration.Worldwide, some 83 cases of liver damage, including hepatitis, liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes, have been associated with using black cohosh, although a cause-and-effect relationship remains undefined. Women have taken black cohosh without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials found no evidence that black cohosh preparations had adverse effects on liver function. According to Cancer Research UK: ""Doctors are worried that using black cohosh long term may cause thickening of the womb lining. This could lead to an increased risk of womb cancer."" They also caution that people with liver problems should not take it as it can damage the liver, although a 2011 meta-analysis of research evidence suggested this concern may be unfounded. In 2007, the Australian Government warned that black cohosh may cause liver damage, although rarely, and should not be used without medical supervision.

Gypsum mortar is an ancient mortar used in building construction.
Plaster ingredients are used in surgical splints, casting moulds and modeling.
Fertilizer and soil conditioner:  In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Nova Scotia gypsum, often referred to as plaster, was a highly sought fertilizer for wheat fields in the United States. It is also used in ameliorating high-sodium soils, such as in the Zuiderzee Works.
A binder in fast-dry tennis court clay
As alabaster, a material for sculpture, it was used especially in the ancient world before steel was developed, when its relative softness made it much easier to carve.
A wood substitute in the ancient world: For example, when wood became scarce due to deforestation on Bronze Age Crete, gypsum was employed in building construction at locations where wood was previously used.
A tofu (soy bean curd) coagulant, making it ultimately a major source of dietary calcium, especially in Asian cultures which traditionally use few dairy products

"('pomegranate peel', 'Cultural history')","Pomegranate is native to a region from modern-day Iran to northern India. Pomegranates have been cultivated throughout the Middle East, South Asia, and Mediterranean region for several millennia, and also thrive in the drier climates of California and Arizona. Pomegranates may have been domesticated as early as the 5th millennium BC, as they were one of the first fruit trees to be domesticated in the eastern Mediterranean region.Carbonized exocarp of the fruit has been identified in early Bronze Age levels of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the West Bank, as well as late Bronze Age levels of Hala Sultan Tekke on Cyprus and Tiryns. A large, dry pomegranate was found in the tomb of Djehuty, the butler of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt; Mesopotamian cuneiform records mention pomegranates from the mid-third millennium BC onwards.
Waterlogged pomegranate remains have been identified at the circa 14th century BC Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey. Other goods on the ship include perfume, ivory and gold jewelry, suggesting that pomegranates at this time may have been considered a luxury good. Other archaeological finds of pomegranate remains from the Late Bronze Age have been found primarily in elite residences, supporting this inference.It is also extensively grown in South China and in Southeast Asia, whether originally spread along the route of the Silk Road or brought by sea traders. Kandahar is famous in Afghanistan for its high-quality pomegranates.Although not native to Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there and many cultivars have been developed. It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers and for the unusual twisted bark the older specimens can attain. The term ""balaustine"" (Latin: balaustinus) is also used for a pomegranate-red color.

Spanish colonists later introduced the fruit to the Caribbean and America (Spanish America), but in the English colonies, it was less at home: ""Don't use the pomegranate inhospitably, a stranger that has come so far to pay his respects to thee,"" the English Quaker Peter Collinson wrote to the botanizing John Bartram in Philadelphia, 1762. ""Plant it against the side of thy house, nail it close to the wall. In this manner it thrives wonderfully with us, and flowers beautifully, and bears fruit this hot year. I have twenty-four on one tree... Doctor Fothergill says, of all trees this is most salutiferous to mankind.""The pomegranate had been introduced as an exotic to England the previous century, by John Tradescant the elder, but the disappointment that it did not set fruit there led to its repeated introduction to the American colonies, even New England. It succeeded in the South: Bartram received a barrel of pomegranates and oranges from a correspondent in Charleston, South Carolina, 1764. John Bartram partook of ""delitious"" pomegranates with Noble Jones at Wormsloe Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia, in September 1765. Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello in 1771: he had them from George Wythe of Williamsburg.After the pomegranate is opened by scoring it with a knife and breaking it open, the seeds are separated from the peel and internal white pulp membranes. Separating the seeds is easier in a bowl of water because the seeds sink and the inedible pulp floats. Freezing the entire fruit also makes it easier to separate. Another effective way of quickly harvesting the seeds is to cut the pomegranate in half, score each half of the exterior rind four to six times, hold the pomegranate half over a bowl, and smack the rind with a large spoon. The seeds should eject from the pomegranate directly into the bowl, leaving only a dozen or more deeply embedded seeds to remove.Pomegranate juice can be sweet or sour, but most fruits are moderate in taste, with sour notes from the acidic ellagitannins contained in the juice. Pomegranate juice has long been a popular drink in Europe and the Middle East, and is now widely distributed in the United States and Canada.Grenadine syrup long ago consisted of thickened and sweetened pomegranate juice, now is usually a sales name for a syrup based on various berries, citric acid, and food coloring, mainly used in cocktail mixing. In Europe, Bols still manufactures grenadine syrup with pomegranate. Before tomatoes (a New World fruit) arrived in the Middle East, pomegranate juice, molasses, and vinegar were widely used in many Iranian foods, and are still found in traditional recipes such as fesenj n, a thick sauce made from pomegranate juice and ground walnuts, usually spooned over duck or other poultry and rice, and in ash-e anar (pomegranate soup).Pomegranate seeds are used as a spice known as anar dana (from Persian: anar + dana , pomegranate + seed), most notably in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. Dried whole seeds can often be obtained in ethnic Indian markets. These seeds are separated from the flesh, dried for 10 15 days, and used as an acidic agent for chutney and curry preparation. Ground anardana is also used, which results in a deeper flavoring in dishes and prevents the seeds from getting stuck in teeth. Seeds of the wild pomegranate variety known as daru from the Himalayas are regarded as high quality sources for this spice.
Dried pomegranate seeds, found in some natural specialty food markets, still contain some residual water, maintaining a natural sweet and tart flavor. Dried seeds can be used in several culinary applications, such as trail mix, granola bars, or as a topping for salad, yogurt, or ice cream.
In the Caucasus, pomegranate is used mainly for juice. In Azerbaijan, a sauce from pomegranate juice narsharab, (from Persian: (a)nar + sharab , lit. ""pomegranate wine"") is usually served with fish or tika kabab.

 In Turkey, pomegranate sauce (Turkish: nar ek isi) is used as a salad dressing, to marinate meat, or simply to drink straight. Pomegranate seeds are also used in salads and sometimes as garnish for desserts such as g lla . Pomegranate syrup or molasses is used in muhammara, a roasted red pepper, walnut, and garlic spread popular in Syria and Turkey.In Greece, pomegranate is used in many recipes, including kollivozoumi, a creamy broth made from boiled wheat, pomegranates, and raisins, legume salad with wheat and pomegranate, traditional Middle Eastern lamb kebabs with pomegranate glaze, pomegranate eggplant relish, and avocado-pomegranate dip. Pomegranate is also made into a liqueur, and as a popular fruit confectionery used as ice cream topping, mixed with yogurt, or spread as jam on toast.
In Mexico, they are commonly used to adorn the traditional dish chiles en nogada, representing the red of the Mexican flag in the dish which evokes the green (poblano pepper), white (nogada sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds) tricolor.

"('jujube seed', 'Cultivation and uses')","Jujube was domesticated in south Asia by 9000 BC.  Over 400 cultivars have been selected.
The tree tolerates a wide range of temperatures and rainfall, though it requires hot summers and sufficient water for acceptable fruiting. Unlike most of the other species in the genus, it tolerates fairly cold winters, surviving temperatures down to about  15  C (5  F) and the tree is for instance commonly cultivated in Beijing. This enables the jujube to grow in mountain or desert habitats, provided there is access to underground water throughout the summer. The jujube, Z. jujuba grows in cooler regions of Asia. Five or more other species of Ziziphus are widely distributed in milder climates to hot deserts of Asia and Africa.In Madagascar, jujube trees grow extensively in the western half of the island, from the north all the way to the south. It is widely eaten by free-ranging zebus, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces. It is  an invasive species there, threatening mostly protected areas.The freshly harvested, as well as the candied dried fruit, are often eaten as a snack, or with coffee. Smoked jujubes are consumed in  Vietnam and are referred to as black jujubes. Both China and Korea produce a sweetened tea syrup containing jujube fruit in glass jars, and canned jujube tea or jujube tea in the form of teabags. To a lesser extent, jujube fruit is made into juice and jujube vinegar (called    or     in Chinese). They are used for making pickles (          ) in west Bengal and Bangladesh. In China, a wine made from jujube fruit is called hong zao jiu (   ).
Sometimes pieces of jujube fruit are preserved by storing them in a jar filled with baijiu (Chinese liquor), which allows them to be kept fresh for a long time, especially through the winter. Such jujubes are called jiu zao (  ; literally ""alcohol jujube""). The fruit is also a significant ingredient in a wide variety of Chinese delicacies (e.g.    jing gao, a steamed rice cake).
In Vietnam and Taiwan, fully mature, nearly ripe fruit is harvested and sold on the local markets and also exported to Southeast Asian countries. The dried fruit is used in desserts in China and Vietnam, such as ching bo leung, a cold beverage that includes the dried jujube, longan, fresh seaweed, barley, and lotus seeds.In Korea, jujubes are called daechu (  ) and are used in daechucha teas and samgyetang.
In Croatia, especially Dalmatia, jujubes are used in marmalades, juices, and rakija (fruit brandy).
On his visit to Medina, the 19th-century English explorer, Sir Richard Burton, observed that the local variety of jujube fruit was widely eaten. He  describes its taste as ""like a bad plum, an unrepentant cherry and an insipid apple."" He gives the local names for three varieties as ""Hindi (Indian), Baladi (native), Tamri (date-like)."" In Palestine a hundred years ago, a close variety was common in the Jordan valley and around Jerusalem. The bedouin valued the fruit, calling it nabk. It could be dried and kept for winter or made into a paste which was used as bread.In Persian cuisine, the dried drupes are known as annab, while in neighboring Azerbaijan, it is commonly eaten as a snack, and is known as innab. Confusion in the common name apparently is widespread. The innab is Z. jujuba: the local name ber is not used for innab. Rather, ber is used for three other cultivated or wild species, e.g., Z. spina-christi, Z. mauritiana, and Z. nummularia in parts of India and is eaten both fresh and dried. The Arabic name sidr is used for Ziziphus species other than Z. jujuba.
Traditionally in India, the fruit is dried in the sun and the hard nuts are removed. Then, it is pounded with tamarind, red chillies, salt, and jaggery. In some parts of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, fresh whole ripe fruit is crushed with the above ingredients and dried under the sun to make cakes called ilanthai vadai or regi vadiyalu (Telugu). It is also commonly consumed as a snack.
In Northern and Northeastern India the fruit is eaten fresh with salt and chilli flakes and also preserved as candy, jam or pickle with oil and spices. 
In Madagascar, jujube fruit is eaten fresh or dried. People also use it to make jam. A jujube honey is produced in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.Italy has an alcoholic syrup called brodo di giuggiole.
In Senegal Jujube is called Sii dem and the fruit is used as snack. The fruit is turned into dried paste used by school kids.
The commercial jujube candy popular in movie theaters originally contained jujube juice but now uses other flavorings.

It is widely eaten by free-ranging zebus, and its seeds grow easily in zebu feces. It is  an invasive species there, threatening mostly protected areas.The fruit and its seeds are used in Chinese and Korean traditional medicine, where they are believed to alleviate stress, and traditionally for anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory purposes and sedation, antispastic, antifertility/contraception, hypotensive and antinephritic, cardiotonic, antioxidant, immunostimulant, and wound healing properties.  It is among the fruits used in Kampo.

As many as 2000 copies could be produced from one jujube woodcut. In China, the leaves are sometimes picked for teas, such as by families in Laoshan Village, Shandong Province, China, where it counts as a variety of herbal tea.

Recommendations include planting a non-host crop for several years after the infestation, pulling up host crops immediately, particularly before the dodder produces seed, and use of preemergent herbicides such as Dacthal in the spring. Examples of non-host crops include grasses and many other monocotyledons. If dodder is found before it chokes a host plant, it may be simply removed from the soil. If choking has begun, the host plant must be pruned significantly below the dodder infestation, as dodder is versatile and able to grow back from its haustoria.","Avian crop,[bpoc],35.32,C0010352|Choking,[patf],29.46,C0008301|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Soil,[sbst],13.03,C0037592|Natural Springs,[npop],12.84,C3179043|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],11.49,C0011119|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],7.47,C0030499|"

"('lindera root', 'Description')","Spicebush is a deciduous shrub growing to 6 12 feet (1.8 3.7 m) tall. It has a colonial nature and often reproduces by root sprouting, forming clumps or thickets. The leaves are alternately arranged on the stem, simple, 6 15 cm (2 6 in) long and 2 6 cm (1 2 in) broad, oval or broadest beyond the middle of the leaf. They have a smooth edge with no teeth and are dark green above and paler below. The leaves, along with the stems are very aromatic when crushed with a spicy, citrusy smell, hence the common names and the specific epithet benzoin. In the fall the leaves turn a very bright and showy yellow color.The yellow flowers grow in showy clusters which appear in early spring, before the leaves begin to grow. The flowers have 6 sepals and a very sweet odor. The ripe fruit is a red, elipsoidal, berrylike drupe, rich in lipids, about 1 cm (1 2 in) long and is eaten by several bird species. It has a ""turpentine-like"" taste and aromatic scent, and contains a large seed. Spicebush is dioecious (plants are either male or female), so that both sexes are needed in a garden if one wants drupes with viable seeds.Like other dioecious plants, the female plants have a greater cost of reproduction compared to the male plants. In the wild, the population tends to have more males than females possibly due to the heavier reproductive costs on females.The stem of L. benzoin has a slightly rough, but flat, bark which is covered in small, circular lenticels which give it a rough texture.Other species in the genus Lindera also have common names containing the word ""spicebush"" and may appear similar. An example is Lindera melissaefolia which grows in swamps in southern US; it is differentiated by its hairy stems.

Western and Islamic herbalists including Dioscorides, Galen, Serapion, Paulus Aegineta, Avicenna, Rhazes, and Charles Alston have described its use as a stomachic, emmenagogue, and deobstruent, and in emollient plasters.The antibacterial properties of the tubers may have helped prevent tooth decay in people who lived in Sudan 2000 years ago. Less than 1% of that local population's teeth had cavities, abscesses, or other signs of tooth decay, though those people were probably farmers (early farmers' teeth typically had more tooth decay than those of hunter-gatherers because the high grain content in their diet created a hospitable environment for bacteria that flourish in the human mouth, excreting acids that eat away at the teeth). 
 C. rotundus has many beneficial uses.  It is a staple carbohydrate in tropical regions for recent hunter-gatherers and is a famine food in some agrarian cultures.Several chemical substances have been identified in C. rotundus: cadalene, cyprotene, flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, terpenoids, mustakone, isocyperol, acyperone, rotundene, valecine, kaempferol, luteolin, quercetin, patchoulenone, isopatchoulenone, sugeonyl acetate, cellulose triacetate and sugebiol. A sesquiterpene, rotundone, so called because it was originally extracted from the tuber of this plant, is responsible for the spicy aroma of black pepper and the peppery taste of certain Australian Shiraz wines.Extract from leaves and tubers of Cyperus rotundus L. increase the adventitious rooting of different species. These extracts contain a large amount of auxins and phenolic compounds that promote the rooting of cuttings and seedlings. 
 C. rotundus has many beneficial uses.  It is a staple carbohydrate in tropical regions for recent hunter-gatherers and is a famine food in some agrarian cultures.Despite the bitter taste of the tubers, they are edible and have nutritional value. Some part of the plant was eaten by humans  between Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The plant has a high amount of carbohydrates. The plant is eaten in Africa in famine-stricken areas.In addition, the tubers are an important nutritional source of minerals and trace elements for migrating birds such as cranes.

"('lemongrass', 'Uses')","Citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus and Cymbopogon winterianus) grow to about 2 m (6.6 ft) and have magenta-colored base stems. These species are used for the production of citronella oil, which is used in soaps, as an insect repellent (especially mosquitoes) in insect sprays and candles, and in aromatherapy. The principal chemical constituents of citronella, geraniol and citronellol, are antiseptics, hence their use in household disinfectants and soaps. Besides oil production, citronella grass is also used for culinary purposes, as a flavoring.
East Indian lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus), also called Cochin grass or Malabar grass, is native to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand, while West Indian lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) is native to maritime Southeast Asia. While both can be used interchangeably, C. citratus is more suitable for cooking. In India, C. citratus is used both as a medical herb and in perfumes. C. citratus is consumed as a tea for anxiety in Brazilian folk medicine, but a study in humans found no effect. The tea caused a recurrence of contact dermatitis in one case.Lemongrass is the primary ingredient of van van oil, one of the most popular oils in conjure.

"('citron', 'Uses')","While the lemon or orange are peeled to consume their pulpy and juicy segments, the citron's pulp is dry, containing a small quantity of insipid juice, if any. The main content of a citron fruit is the thick white rind, which adheres to the segments and cannot be separated from them easily. The citron gets halved and depulped, then its rind (the thicker the better) is cut in pieces, cooked in sugar syrup, and used as a spoon sweet, in Greek known as ""kitro glyko"" (           ), or it is diced and caramelized with sugar and used as a confection in cakes.

In Samoa a refreshing drink called ""vai tipolo"" is made from squeezed juice. It is also added to a raw fish dish called ""oka"" and to a variation of palusami or lu u.
Citron is a regularly used item in Asian cuisine. The variety of citron used in Japan, yuzu, is juiced, and the juice is used regularly in dipping sauces, dressings and marinades. The juice is widely available bottled like lemon juice. Grated or shredded yuzu rind is also added to marinades and desserts, and hollowed out yuzu can be seen as decorative containers in higher end restaurants. In Korea, a popular tea, yuja-cha, is made by mixing citron meat and julienned peels with sugar and honey. This tea is consumed both hot and iced, and is often taken for sore throats and colds in winter.
Today the citron is used for the fragrance or zest of its flavedo, but the most important part is still the inner rind (known as pith or albedo), which is a fairly important article in international trade and is widely employed in the food industry as succade, as it is known when it is candied in sugar.
The dozens of varieties of citron are collectively known as Lebu in Bangladesh, West Bengal, where it is the primary citrus fruit.
In Iran, the citron's thick white rind is used to make jam; in Pakistan the fruit is used to make jam but is also pickled; in South Indian cuisine, some varieties of citron (collectively referred to as ""Narthangai"" in Tamil and ""Heralikayi"" in Kannada) are widely used in pickles and preserves.In karnataka, heralikayi(citron) is uses to make lemon rice. In Kutch, Gujarat, it is used to make pickle, wherein entire slices of fruits are salted, dried and mixed with jaggery and spices to make sweet spicy pickle. In the United States, citron is an important ingredient in holiday fruitcakes. 
 From ancient through medieval times, the citron was used mainly for medical purposes: to combat seasickness, pulmonary troubles, intestinal ailments, scurvy and other disorders. The essential oil of the flavedo (the outermost, pigmented layer of rind) was also regarded as an antibiotic. Citron juice with wine was considered an effective antidote to poison, as Theophrastus reported. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, the juice is still used for treating conditions like nausea, vomiting, and excessive thirst.
The juice of the citron has a high Vitamin C content and is used in the Indian system of medicine as an anthelmintic, appetizer, tonic, in cough, rheumatism, vomiting, flatulence, haemorrhoids, skin diseases and weak eyesight.There is an increasing market for the citron for the soluble fiber (pectin) found in its thick albedo. 
 The citron is used by Jews (the word for it in Hebrew is etrog) for a religious ritual during the Jewish harvest holiday of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles; therefore, it is considered to be a Jewish symbol, one found on various Hebrew antiques and archaeological findings. Citrons used for ritual purposes cannot be grown by grafting branches. 
 A variety of citron native to China has sections that separate into finger-like parts and is used as an offering in Buddhist temples. 
 For many centuries, citron's fragrant essential oil has been used in perfumery, the same oil that was used medicinally for its antibiotic properties.

"('fennel seed', 'Cultivation and uses')","Fennel is widely cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, strongly flavored leaves and fruits. Its aniseed flavor comes from anethole, an aromatic compound also found in anise and star anise, and its taste and aroma are similar to theirs, though usually not as strong.Florence fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Azoricum Group; syn. F. vulgare var. azoricum) is a cultivar group with inflated leaf bases which form a bulb-like structure. It is of cultivated origin, and has a mild anise-like flavor, but is sweeter and more aromatic. Florence fennel plants are smaller than the wild type. The inflated leaf bases are eaten as a vegetable, both raw and cooked. Several cultivars of Florence fennel are also known by several other names, notably the Italian name finocchio. In North American supermarkets, it is often mislabeled as ""anise"".Foeniculum vulgare 'Purpureum' or 'Nigra', ""bronze-leaved"" fennel, is widely available as a decorative garden plant.Fennel has become naturalized along roadsides, in pastures, and in other open sites in many regions, including northern Europe, the United States, southern Canada, and much of Asia and Australia. It propagates well by seed, and is considered an invasive species and a weed in Australia and the United States. In western North America, fennel can be found from the coastal and inland wildland-urban interface east into hill and mountain areas, excluding desert habitats.Florence fennel is one of the three main herbs used in the preparation of absinthe, an alcoholic mixture which originated as a medicinal elixir in Switzerland and became, by the late 19th century, a popular alcoholic drink in France and other countries.

"('fennel seed', 'Uses')","The bulb, foliage, and fruits of the fennel plant are used in many of the culinary traditions of the world. The small flowers of wild fennel (known as fennel ""pollen"" ) are the most potent form of fennel, but also the most expensive.
Dried fennel fruit is an aromatic, anise-flavored spice, brown or green in color when fresh, slowly turning a dull grey as the fruit ages. For cooking, green fruits are optimal. The leaves are delicately flavored and similar in shape to those of dill. The bulb is a crisp vegetable that can be saut ed, stewed, braised, grilled, or eaten raw. Young tender leaves are used for garnishes, as a salad, to add flavor to salads, to flavor sauces to be served with puddings, and also in soups and fish sauce.Fennel fruits are sometimes confused with those of anise, which are similar in taste and appearance, though smaller. Fennel is also used as a flavoring in some natural toothpastes. The fruits are used in cookery and sweet desserts.Many cultures in India, Afghanistan, Iran, and the Middle East use fennel fruits in cooking.  It is one of the most important spices in Kashmiri Pandit  and Gujarati cooking. It is an essential ingredient of the Assamese/Bengali/Oriya spice mixture panch phoron and in Chinese five-spice powders. In many parts of India, roasted fennel fruits are consumed as mukhwas, an after-meal digestive and breath freshener, or candied as comfit.
Fennel leaves are used in some parts of India as leafy green vegetables either by themselves or mixed with other vegetables, cooked to be served and consumed as part of a meal. In Syria and Lebanon, the young leaves are used to make a special kind of egg omelette (along with onions and flour) called ijjeh.
Many egg, fish, and other dishes employ fresh or dried fennel leaves. Florence fennel is a key ingredient in some Italian and German salads, often tossed with chicory and avocado, or it can be braised and served as a warm side dish. It may be blanched or marinated, or cooked in risotto.
Fennel fruits are the primary flavor component in Italian sausage. In Spain, the stems of the fennel plant are used in the preparation of pickled eggplants, berenjenas de Almagro. An herbal tea or tisane can be made from fennel.On account of its aromatic properties, fennel fruit forms one of the ingredients of the well-known compound liquorice powder. In the Indian subcontinent, fennel fruits are also eaten raw, sometimes with a sweetener.

"('stinging nettle leaf', 'Uses')","U. dioica has a flavour similar to spinach mixed with cucumber when cooked, and is rich in vitamins A and C, iron, potassium, manganese, and calcium. Young plants were harvested by Native Americans and used as a cooked plant in spring when other food plants were scarce. Soaking stinging nettles in water or cooking removes the stinging chemicals from the plant, which allows them to be handled and eaten without injury. After the stinging nettle enters its flowering and seed-setting stages, the leaves develop gritty particles called cystoliths, which can irritate the urinary tract. In its peak season, nettle contains up to 25% protein, dry weight, which is high for a leafy green vegetable. The leaves are also dried and may then be used to make a herbal tea, as can also be done with the nettle's flowers.
Nettles can be used in a variety of recipes, such as polenta, pesto, and pur e. Nettle soup is a common use of the plant, particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe.
Nettles are sometimes used in cheesemaking, for example in the production of Cornish Yarg and as a flavouring in varieties of Gouda.Nettles are used in Albania as part of the dough filling for the b rek. The top baby leaves are selected and simmered, then mixed with other ingredients such as herbs and rice, before being used as a filling between dough layers. Similarly, in Greece the tender leaves are often used, after simmering, as a filling for hortopita, which is similar to spanakopita, but with wild greens rather than spinach for filling.In the UK, an annual World Nettle Eating Championship draws thousands of people to Dorset, where competitors attempt to eat as much of the raw plant as possible. Competitors are given 60 cm (24 in) stalks of the plant, from which they strip the leaves and eat them. Whoever strips and eats the most stinging nettle leaves in a fixed time is the winner. The competition dates back to 1986, when two neighbouring farmers attempted to settle a dispute about which had the worst infestation of nettles. 
 Nettle leaves are steeped in a concentrated sugar solution to extract the flavour. The leaves are then removed and a source of citric acid (usually lemon juice) is added to help preserve the cordial and add a tart flavour.
Commercially produced cordials are generally quite concentrated and are usually diluted by one part cordial to ten parts water   thus a 0.5 l (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 US gal) bottle of cordial would be enough for 5.5 litres (1.2 imp gal; 1.5 US gal) diluted. The high concentration of sugar in nettle cordial gives it a long shelf life.
Also, many recipes for alcoholic nettle beer are used, which is a countryside favourite in the British Isles. 
 U. dioica herb has been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally (as tea or fresh leaves) to treat disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, locomotor system, skin, cardiovascular system, hemorrhage, influenza, rheumatism, and gout.As Old English sti e, nettle is one of the nine plants invoked in the pagan Anglo-Saxon Nine Herbs Charm, recorded in the 10th century. Nettle was believed to be a galactagogue, a substance that promotes lactation.Urtication, or flogging with nettles, is the process of deliberately applying stinging nettles to the skin in order to provoke inflammation. An agent thus used is known as a rubefacient (something that causes redness). This is done as a folk remedy for treatment of rheumatism. In Ecuador there are indigenous healers that use stinging nettles with the belief that they improve fatigue and circulation, by rubbing raw leaves or flogging the plant directly on the body. 
 Nettle stems contain a bast fibre that has been traditionally used for the same purposes as linen and is produced by a similar retting process. Unlike cotton, nettles grow easily without pesticides. The fibres are coarser, however.Historically, nettles have been used to make clothing for almost 3,000 years, as ancient nettle textiles from the Bronze Age have been found in Denmark. German Army uniforms were almost all made from nettle during World War I due to a potential shortage of cotton. More recently, companies in Austria, Germany, and Italy have started to produce commercial nettle textiles.The fibre content in nettle shows a high variability and reaches from below 1% to 17%. Under middle-European conditions, stems yield typically between 45 and 55 dt / ha (decitons per hectare), which is comparable to flax stem yield. Due to the variable fibre content, the fibre yields vary between 0.2 and 7 dt / ha, but the yields are normally in the range between 2 and 4 dt / ha. Fibre varieties are normally cloning varieties and therefore planted from vegetative propagated plantlets. Direct seeding is possible, but leads to great heterogeneity in maturity.Nettles may be used as a dye-stuff, producing yellow from the roots, or yellowish green from the leaves. 
 Fresh leaves contain approximately 82.4% water, 17.6% dry matter, 5.5% protein, 0.7 to 3.3% fat, and 7.1% carbohydrates. Mature leaves contain about 40%  - linolenic acid, a valuable omega-3 acid. For exact fatty acid contents see Table 1. Seeds contain much more fatty acid than leaves.
Minerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, Si, S, Cl) and trace elements (Mn, Cu, Fe) contents depend mostly on the soil and the season.Carotenoids can be found primarily in the leaves, where different forms of lutein, xanthophyll and carotene are present (Table 2). Some carotenes are precursors of vitamin A (retinol), their retinol equivalents RE or retinol activity equivalents per g dry weight are 1.33 for mature leaves and 0.9 for young leaves. Nettle contains much less carotenes and retinol than carrots, which contain 8.35 RE per g fresh weight. Depending on the batch and the leave and stem content, nettle contains only traces of zeaxanthin or between 20   60 mg / kg of dry matter. Nettle contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C), riboflavin (vitamin B2), pantothenic acid, vitamin K1 and tocopherols (vitamin E). The highest vitamin contents can be found in the leaves. 
 In laying hens, nettle can be used as an egg yolk colorant instead of artificial pigments or other natural pigments (derived from marigold for yellow). Nettle has high carotenoid contents, especially lutein,  -carotene and zeaxanthin, of which lutein and zeaxanthin act as yellow pigments. Feeding as little as 6.25 g dry nettle per kg feed is as effective as the synthetic pigments to colour the egg yolk. Feeding nettle has no detrimental effect on the performance of the laying hens or the general egg quality. 
 Ruminants also avoid fresh stinging nettles, however if the nettles are wilted or dry, voluntary intake can be high. Dry nettle shoots are said to be  as good as good alfalfa hay . As with other leafy herbs with relatively hard stems, the harvest should be done carefully to avoid leaf drop losses. Nettle can be conserved as hay or silage. 
 Nettles have a number of other uses in the vegetable garden, including the potential for encouraging beneficial insects. Since nettles prefer to grow in phosphorus-rich and nitrogen rich soils that have recently been disturbed (and thus aerated), the growth of nettles is an indicator that an area has high fertility (especially phosphate and nitrate), and thus is an indicator to gardeners as to the quality of the soil.Nettles contain nitrogenous compounds, so are used as a compost activator or can be used to make a liquid fertilizer, which although low in phosphate, is useful in supplying magnesium, sulphur, and iron. They are also one of the few plants that can tolerate, and flourish in, soils rich in poultry droppings.
The stinging nettle is the Red Admiral caterpillar's primary host plant and can attract migrating Red Admiral butterflies to a garden. U. dioica can be a troubling weed, and mowing can increase plant density. Regular and persistent tilling will greatly reduce its numbers, and the use of herbicides such as 2,4-D and glyphosate are effective control measures.","Body Weight,[orga],22.61,C0005910|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Urinary Bladder Calculi (disorder),[dsyn],20.95,C0005683|Desiccation,[npop],20.30,C0011682|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.21,C0682897|Set (Psychology),[menp],13.44,C0036849|Natural Springs,[npop],13.25,C3179043|Eating,[orgf],13.02,C0013470|Urinary tract,[bpoc],8.34,C0042027|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.45,C3263723|Sting Injury,[inpo],3.41,C0038340|Eating,[orgf],54.00,C0013470|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],16.18,C0935572|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.56,C0030499|flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.43,C0682897|Solutions,[sbst],6.71,C0037633|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.46,C0599638|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.16,C0014518|Mental concentration,[menp],3.56,C0086045|Breast Feeding,[orgf],20.95,C0006147|Collagen Diseases,[dsyn],19.94,C0009326|Rheumatism,[dsyn],19.94,C0035435|Gout,[dsyn],17.80,C0018099|Erythema,[dsyn],14.64,C0041834|Influenza,[dsyn],14.64,C0021400|Lactation,[ortf],14.64,C0022925|Kidney Diseases,[dsyn],13.14,C0022658|Sexually Transmitted Diseases,[dsyn],12.93,C0036916|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Hemorrhage,[patf],11.49,C0019080|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Urinary tract,[bpoc],8.34,C0042027|World War I,[acty],19.34,C1449759|Fibrosis,[patf],10.10,C0016059|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Genetic Heterogeneity,[orga],9.88,C0242960|Clone Cells,[cell],9.78,C0009013|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.54,C0599638|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Desiccation,[npop],9.92,C0011682|Body Weight,[orga],44.96,C0005910|Hippocampus Proper,[bpoc],27.26,C3887642|Desiccation,[npop],19.69,C0011682|Soil,[sbst],13.03,C0037592|Pigmentation,[orga],53.90,C0031911|Ovum,[cell],12.94,C0029974|Desiccation,[npop],9.73,C0011682|Desiccation,[npop],19.68,C0011682|Soil,[sbst],39.82,C0037592|Compost,[sbst],25.64,C1258026|Fertility,[orgf],9.99,C0015895|Growth,[orgf],9.88,C0018270|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],9.99,C0024809|"

"('flax seed', 'Uses')","Flax is grown for its seeds, which can be ground into a meal or turned into linseed oil, a product used as a nutritional supplement and as an ingredient in many wood-finishing products. Flax is also grown as an ornamental plant in gardens. Moreover, flax fibers are used to make linen. The specific epithet, usitatissimum, means ""most useful"".Flax fibers taken from the stem of the plant are two to three times as strong as cotton fibers. Additionally, flax fibers are naturally smooth and straight. Europe and North America both depended on flax for plant-based cloth until the 19th century, when cotton overtook flax as the most common plant for making rag-based paper. Flax is grown on the Canadian prairies for linseed oil, which is used as a drying oil in paints and varnishes and in products such as linoleum and printing inks.
Linseed meal, the by-product of producing linseed oil from flax seeds, is used as livestock fodder.Flaxseeds occur in two basic varieties/colors: brown or yellow (golden linseeds). Most types of these basic varieties have similar nutritional characteristics and equal numbers of short-chain omega-3 fatty acids. An exception is a type of yellow flax called solin (trade name ""Linola""), which has a completely different oil profile and is very low in omega-3s (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), specifically).Flaxseeds produce a vegetable oil known as flaxseed oil or linseed oil, which is one of the oldest commercial oils. It is an edible oil obtained by expeller pressing and sometimes followed by solvent extraction. Solvent-processed flaxseed oil has been used for many centuries as a drying oil in painting and varnishing.Although brown flaxseed varieties may be consumed as readily as the yellow ones, and have been for thousands of years, its better-known uses are in paints, for fiber, and for cattle feed.A 100-gram portion of ground flaxseed supplies about 534 calories (2,230 kJ), 41 g of fat, 28 g of fiber, and 20 g of protein.Flaxseed sprouts are edible and have a slightly spicy flavor profile. Excessive consumption of flaxseeds with inadequate amounts of water may cause bowel obstruction. In northern India, flaxseed, called tisi or alsi, is traditionally roasted, ground to a powder, and eaten with boiled rice, a little water, and a little salt. In India, linseed oil is known as alsi in Hindi and javas in Marathi. It is mainly used in Savji curries, such as mutton (goat meat) curries.
Whole flaxseeds are chemically stable, but ground flaxseed meal, because of oxidation, may go rancid when left exposed to air at room temperature in as little as one week. Refrigeration and storage in sealed containers will keep ground flaxseed meal for a longer period before it turns rancid. Under conditions similar to those found in commercial bakeries, trained sensory panelists could not detect differences between bread made with freshly ground flaxseed and bread made with flaxseed that had been milled four months earlier and stored at room temperature. This shows, if packed immediately without exposure to air and light, milled flaxseed is stable against excessive oxidation when stored for nine months at room temperature, and under warehouse conditions, for 20 months at ambient temperatures.
Three natural phenolic glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid glucoside, and ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed.

Solvent-processed flaxseed oil has been used for many centuries as a drying oil in painting and varnishing.Although brown flaxseed varieties may be consumed as readily as the yellow ones, and have been for thousands of years, its better-known uses are in paints, for fiber, and for cattle feed.After crushing the seeds to extract linseed oil, the resultant linseed meal is a protein-rich feed for ruminants, rabbits, and fish. It is also often used as feed for swine and poultry, and has also been used in horse concentrate and dog food. The high omega-3 fatty acid (ALA) content of linseed meal ""softens"" milk, eggs or meat, which means it causes a higher unsaturated fat content and thus lowers its storage time. The high omega-3 content also has a further disadvantage, because this fatty acid oxidises and goes rancid quickly, which shortens the storage time. Linola was developed in Australia and introduced in the 1990s with less omega-3, specifically to serve as fodder. Another disadvantage of the meal and seed is that it contains a vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) antagonist, and may require this vitamin be supplemented, especially in chickens, and furthermore linseeds contain 2-7% of mucilage (fibre), which may be beneficial in humans and cattle, but cannot be digested by non-ruminants and can be detrimental to young animals, unless possibly treated with enzymes.Linseed meal is added to cattle feed as a protein supplement. It can only be added at low percentages due to the high fat content, which is unhealthy for ruminants. Compared to oilseed meal from crucifers it measures as having lower nutrient values, however, good results are obtained in cattle, perhaps due to the mucilage, which may aid in slowing digestion and thus allowing more time to absorb nutrients. One study found that feeding flax seeds may increase omega-3 content in beef, while another found no differences. It might also act as a substitute to tallow in increasing marbling. In the USA, flax-based feed for ruminants is often somewhat more expensive than other feeds on a nutrient basis. Sheep feeding on low quality forage are able to eat a large amount of linseed meal, up to 40% in one test, with positive consequences. It has been fed as supplement to water buffaloes in India, and provided a better diet than forage alone, but not as good as when substituted with soy meal. It is considered an inferior protein supplement for swine because of its fibre, the vitamin antagonist, the high omega-3 content and its low lysine content, and can only be used in small amounts in the feed. Although it may increase the omega-3 content in eggs and meat, it is also an inferior and potentially toxic feed for poultry, although it can be used in small amounts. The meal is an adequate and traditional source of protein for rabbits at 8-10%. Its use in fish feeds is limited.Raw, immature linseeds contain an amount of cyanogenic compounds and can be dangerous for monogastric animals such as horses or rabbits. Boiling removes the danger. This is not an issue in meal cake due to the processing temperature during oil extraction.Flax straw left over from the harvesting of oilseed is not very nutritious; it is tough and indigestible, and is not recommended to use as ruminant fodder, although it may be used as bedding or baled as windbreaks.

Linseed meal, the by-product of producing linseed oil from flax seeds, is used as livestock fodder.Flax fiber is extracted from the bast beneath the surface of the stem of the flax plant. Flax fiber is soft, lustrous, and flexible; bundles of fiber have the appearance of blonde hair, hence the description ""flaxen"" hair. It is stronger than cotton fiber, but less elastic. The best grades are used for fabrics such as damasks, lace, and sheeting. Coarser grades are used for the manufacturing of twine and rope, and historically, for canvas and webbing equipment. Flax fiber is a raw material used in the high-quality paper industry for the use of printed banknotes, laboratory paper (blotting and filter), rolling paper for cigarettes, and tea bags.

The use of flax fibers dates back tens of thousands of years; linen, a refined textile made from flax fibers, was worn widely by Sumerian priests more than 4,000 years ago. Industrial-scale flax fiber processing existed in antiquity. A Bronze Age factory dedicated to flax processing was discovered in Euonymeia, Greece.Flax mills for spinning flaxen yarn were invented by John Kendrew and Thomas Porthouse of Darlington, England, in 1787. New methods of processing flax  have led to renewed interest in the use of flax as an industrial fiber.","Wood material,[sbst],12.94,C0043217|Cotton Fiber,[sbst],12.92,C0304069|Desiccation,[npop],9.87,C0011682|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.17,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.24,C0682897|Intestinal Obstruction,[dsyn],14.64,C0021843|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|furuncle,[dsyn],3.42,C0242301|Body Temperature,[orga],49.42,C0005903|Air (substance),[sbst],32.91,C0001861|Disease,[dsyn],30.52,C0012634|Light,[npop],17.80,C0023693|Conditioning (Psychology),[menp],13.28,C0009647|Esthesia,[ortf],9.76,C0036658|Wood material,[sbst],12.94,C0043217|Cotton Fiber,[sbst],12.92,C0304069|Desiccation,[npop],9.87,C0011682|Fish-Eye Disease,[dsyn],22.51,C0342895|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Body Temperature,[orga],16.16,C0005903|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Digestion,[orgf],13.03,C0012238|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.87,C0012159|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|Wood material,[sbst],12.94,C0043217|Cotton Fiber,[sbst],12.92,C0304069|Desiccation,[npop],9.87,C0011682|Hair,[bpoc],13.41,C0018494|Cotton Fiber,[sbst],12.94,C0304069|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.14,C0014518|"

Flax contains hundreds of times more lignans than other plant foods. Flaxseeds are especially rich in thiamine, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus (DVs above 90%).
As a percentage of total fat, flaxseeds contain 54% omega-3 fatty acids (mostly ALA), 18% omega-9 fatty acids (oleic acid), and 6% omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid); the seeds contain 9% saturated fat, including 5% as palmitic acid. Flaxseed oil contains 53% 18:3 omega-3 fatty acids (mostly ALA) and 13% 18:2 omega-6 fatty acids.One study of research published between 1990 and 2008 showed that consuming flaxseed or its derivatives may reduce total and LDL-cholesterol in the blood, with greater benefits in women and those with high cholesterol.A meta-analysis has shown that consumption of more than 30 g of flaxseed daily for more than 12 weeks reduced body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference for persons with a BMI greater than 27. Another meta-analysis has shown that consumption of flaxseed for more than 12 weeks produced small reductions in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure.

"("" job's tears"", 'Uses')","Besides the use for ornamental purposes, Job's tears grains are useful as a source of food (cereals) and folk medicine.Throughout East Asia, Job's tears  are available in dried form and cooked as a grain. The grains are generally spherical, with a groove on one end, and polished white in color, though in Japan unpolished yuuki hatomugi, which is unpolished and brown in color, is also available.
In Korea, a thick drink called yulmu cha (   , literally ""Job's tears tea"") is made from powdered Job's tears. A similar drink, called yi ren jiang  (   ), also appears in Chinese cuisine, and is made by simmering whole polished Job's tears in water and sweetening the resulting thin, cloudy liquid with sugar.  The grains are usually strained from the liquid but may also be consumed separately or together.

In both Korea and China, distilled liquors are also made from the grain. One such example is the Korean liquor called okroju (   ; hanja:    ), which is made from rice and Job's tears. An ancient Chinese beer recipe included the grain as an ingredient. In Japan, an aged vinegar is made from the grain.In southern Vietnam, a sweet, cold soup called s m b  l  ng has Job's tears as one of its ingredients. This dish derives from the southern Chinese tong sui called q ng b  li ng (   ; Cantonese: ching1 bou2 leung4).

"('sharp-leaf galangal fruit', 'Uses')","In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of Indian bay leaf, although they have a different flavour. They are most often used in rice dishes like biryani and as an ingredient in garam masala. Bay (laurel) leaves are frequently packaged as tejpatt  (        , the Hindi term for Indian bay leaf), creating confusion between the two herbs.
In the Philippines, dried bay laurel leaves are used in several Filipino dishes such as menudo, beef pares, and adobo.
Bay leaves were used for flavouring by the ancient Greeks. They are a fixture in the cooking of many European cuisines (particularly those of the Mediterranean), as well as in the Americas. They are used in soups, stews, meat, seafood, vegetable dishes, and sauces. The leaves also flavour many classic French dishes. The leaves are most often used whole (sometimes in a bouquet garni) and removed before serving (they can be abrasive in the digestive tract). Thai and Laotian cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai:         , bai kra w n) in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably massaman curry.Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking. Crushed bay leaves impart more fragrance than whole leaves, but are more difficult to remove, and thus they are often used in a muslin bag or tea infuser. Ground bay laurel may be substituted for whole leaves, and does not need to be removed, but it is much stronger.
Bay leaves are also used in the making of jerk chicken in the Caribbean Islands. The bay leaves are soaked and placed on the cool side of the grill. Pimento sticks are placed on top of the leaves and the chicken is placed on top and smoked.
Bay leaves can also be used scattered in a pantry to repel meal moths, flies, cockroaches,  mice, and silverfish.Bay leaves have been used in entomology as the active ingredient in killing jars. The crushed, fresh, young leaves are put into the jar under a layer of paper. The vapors they release kill insects slowly but effectively, and keep the specimens relaxed and easy to mount. The leaves discourage the growth of molds. They are not effective for killing large beetles and similar specimens, but insects that have been killed in a cyanide killing jar can be transferred to a laurel jar to await mounting. There is confusion in the literature about whether Laurus nobilis is a source of cyanide to any practical extent, but there is no evidence that cyanide is relevant to its value in killing jars. It certainly is rich in various essential oil components that could incapacitate insects in high concentrations; such compounds include 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and methyl eugenol. It also is unclear to what extent the alleged effect of cyanide released by the crushed leaves has been mis-attributed to Laurus nobilis in confusion with the unrelated Prunus laurocerasus, the so-called cherry laurel, which certainly does contain dangerous concentrations of cyanogenic glycocides together with the enzymes to generate the hydrogen cyanide from the glycocides if the leaf is physically damaged.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.45,C0682897|Term Birth,[orgf],19.32,C0233324|Confusion,[mobd],16.18,C0009676|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.15,C0020498|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.14,C0020498|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.42,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],38.99,C0682897|Crushing injury,[inpo],13.66,C0332679|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.56,C2987717|Patient Discharge,[hlca],39.14,C0030685|Confusion,[mobd],32.53,C0009676|Crushing injury,[inpo],13.81,C0332679|Psychological Transfer,[menp],12.99,C0040671|Relaxation,[acty],11.49,C0035028|Growth,[orgf],9.88,C0018270|Mental concentration,[menp],7.02,C0086045|"
"('sharp-leaf galangal fruit', 'Safety')","Some members of the laurel family, as well as the unrelated but visually similar mountain laurel and cherry laurel, have leaves that are poisonous to humans and livestock. While these plants are not sold anywhere for culinary use, their visual similarity to bay leaves has led to the oft-repeated belief that bay leaves should be removed from food after cooking because they are poisonous. This is not true; bay leaves may be eaten without toxic effect. However, they remain unpleasantly stiff even after thorough cooking, and if swallowed whole or in large pieces, they may pose a risk of harming the digestive tract or causing choking. Thus, most recipes that use bay leaves will recommend their removal after the cooking process has finished.The Canadian government requires that the bay leaves contain no more than 4.5% total ash material with a maximum of 0.5% of which is insoluble in hydrochloric acid. To be considered dried it has to contain 7% moisture or less.

"('ginkgo leaf', 'Uses')","Ginkgos are popular subjects for growing as penjing and bonsai; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed. 
 The nut-like gametophytes inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in congee, and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha's delight). In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also consider them to have aphrodisiac qualities. Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called ginnan) to dishes such as chawanmushi, and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes.
When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by 4'-O-methylpyridoxine (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking. Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with pyridoxine (vitamin B6).
Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the sarcotesta, the outer fleshy coating. These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing disposable gloves. The symptoms are allergic contact dermatitis or blisters similar to that caused by contact with poison ivy. 
 The first use as a medicine is recorded in the late 15th century in China; among western countries, its first registered medicinal use was in Germany in 1965. Despite use, controlled studies do not support the extract's efficacy for most of the indicated conditions. 
 Although extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaf sold as dietary supplements may be marketed as being beneficial for cognitive function, there is no evidence for effects on memory or attention in healthy people. Gingko extract has also been studied in Alzheimer's disease, but there is no good evidence that it has any effect.Systematic reviews have shown there is no evidence for effectiveness of ginkgo in treating high blood pressure, menopause-related cognitive decline, tinnitus, post-stroke recovery, peripheral arterial disease, macular degeneration, or altitude sickness. 
 The use of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants, such as aspirin or warfarin, although studies have found ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects. Additional side effects include increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and restlessness.According to a systemic review, the effects of ginkgo on pregnant women may include increased bleeding time, and it should be avoided during lactation because of inadequate safety evidence.Ginkgo biloba leaves and sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids, which are highly allergenic, long-chain alkylphenols such as bilobol or adipostatin A (bilobol is a substance related to anacardic acid from cashew nut shells and urushiols present in poison ivy and other Toxicodendron spp.) Individuals with a history of strong allergic reactions to poison ivy, mangoes, cashews and other alkylphenol-producing plants are more likely to experience allergic reaction when consuming non-standardized ginkgo-containing preparations, combinations, or extracts thereof. The level of these allergens in standardized pharmaceutical preparations from Ginkgo biloba was restricted to 5 ppm by the Commission E of the former Federal German Health Authority. Overconsumption of seeds from Gingko biloba can deplete vitamin B6.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.08,C0020498|Gametophytes,[cell],16.18,C2717773|Eating,[orgf],12.99,C0013470|Gametophytes,[cell],17.80,C2717773|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Poisoning,[inpo],6.71,C0032343|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.68,C0018837|Dermatitis, Allergic Contact,[dsyn],17.80,C0162820|Bulla,[anab],14.64,C0005758|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.72,C0020517|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.44,C0009830|Disease,[dsyn],9.71,C0012634|Peripheral Arterial Diseases,[dsyn],20.95,C1704436|Tinnitus,[dsyn],20.95,C0040264|Alzheimer's Disease,[dsyn],16.26,C0002395|Cerebrovascular accident,[dsyn],16.09,C0038454|Age related macular degeneration,[dsyn],14.64,C0242383|Memory,[menp],14.64,C0025260|Impaired cognition,[mobd],13.14,C0338656|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Altitude Sickness,[dsyn],11.49,C0002351|Peripheral Vascular Diseases,[dsyn],11.49,C0085096|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],10.11,C0020538|Cognition,[menp],9.79,C0009240|Mental deterioration,[mobd],3.68,C0234985|Psychomotor Agitation,[fndg],20.95,C3887612|Breast Feeding,[orgf],19.36,C0006147|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Allergic Reaction,[patf],13.59,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],13.59,C0020517|Lactation,[ortf],13.05,C0022925|Disease,[dsyn],9.94,C0012634|Hemorrhage,[patf],9.75,C0019080|Hematological Disease,[dsyn],6.93,C0018939|Heart,[bpoc],6.66,C0018787|"

"('turmeric tuber', 'Uses')","Turmeric is one of the key ingredients in many Asian dishes, imparting a mustard-like, earthy aroma and pungent, slightly bitter flavor to foods. It is used mostly in savory dishes, but also is used in some sweet dishes, such as the cake sfouf. In India, turmeric leaf is used to prepare special sweet dishes, patoleo, by layering rice flour and coconut-jaggery mixture on the leaf, then closing and steaming it in a special utensil (chondr ). Most turmeric is used in the form of rhizome powder to impart a golden yellow color. It is used in many products such as canned beverages, baked products, dairy products, ice cream, yogurt, yellow cakes, orange juice, biscuits, popcorn color, cereals, sauces, and gelatin. It is a principal ingredient in curry powders. Although typically used in its dried, powdered form, turmeric also is used fresh, like ginger. It has numerous uses in East Asian recipes, such as a pickle that contains large chunks of fresh soft turmeric.
Turmeric is used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking. Various Iranian khoresh recipes begin with onions caramelized in oil and turmeric. The Moroccan spice mix ras el hanout typically includes turmeric. In South Africa, turmeric is used to give boiled white rice a golden color, known as geelrys (yellow rice) traditionally served with bobotie. In Vietnamese cuisine, turmeric powder is used to color and enhance the flavors of certain dishes, such as b nh x o, b nh kh t, and mi quang. The staple Cambodian curry paste, kroeung, used in many dishes including amok, typically contains fresh turmeric. In Indonesia, turmeric leaves are used for Minang or Padang curry base of Sumatra, such as rendang, sate padang, and many other varieties. In Thailand, fresh turmeric rhizomes are used widely in many dishes, in particular in the southern Thai cuisine, such as yellow curry and turmeric soup. Turmeric is used in a hot drink called ""turmeric latte"" or ""golden milk"" that is made with milk, frequently coconut milk. The turmeric milk drink known as haldi doodh (haldi means turmeric in Hindi) is a South Asian recipe. Sold in the US and UK, the drink known as ""golden mylk"" uses nondairy milk and sweetener, and sometimes black pepper after the traditional recipe (which may also use ghee). 
 The golden yellow color of turmeric is due to curcumin. It also contains an orange-colored volatile oil. Turmeric makes a poor fabric dye, as it is not very light fast, but is commonly used in Indian  clothing, such as saris and Buddhist monks's robes. It is used to protect food products from sunlight, coded as E100 when used as a food additive. The oleoresin is used for oil-containing products. A curcumin and polysorbate solution or curcumin powder dissolved in alcohol is used for water-containing products. Overcoloring, such as in pickles, relishes, and mustard, is sometimes used to compensate for fading.
In combination with annatto (E160b), turmeric has been used to color cheeses, yogurt, dry mixes, salad dressings, winter butter, and margarine. Turmeric is used to give a yellow color to some prepared mustards, canned chicken broths, and other foods often as a much cheaper replacement for saffron. 
 Turmeric paper, also called curcuma paper or in German literature, Curcumapapier, is paper steeped in a tincture of turmeric and allowed to dry. It is used in chemical analysis as an indicator for acidity and alkalinity. The paper is yellow in acidic and neutral solutions and turns brown to reddish-brown in alkaline solutions, with transition between pH of 7.4 and 9.2. 
 Turmeric grows wild in the forests of South and Southeast Asia, where it is collected for use in classical Indian medicine (Siddha or Ayurveda).In Eastern India, the plant is used as one of the nine components of navapatrika along with young plantain or banana plant, taro leaves, barley (jayanti), wood apple (bilva), pomegranate (darimba), asoka, manaka (Arum), or manakochu, and rice paddy. The Haldi ceremony called gaye holud in Bengal (literally ""yellow on the body"") is a ceremony observed during wedding celebrations of people of Indian culture all throughout the Indian subcontinent.In Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, as a part of the Tamil Telugu marriage ritual, dried turmeric tuber tied with string is used to create a Thali necklace. In western and coastal India, during weddings of the Marathi and Konkani people, Kannada Brahmins, turmeric tubers are tied with strings by the couple to their wrists during a ceremony, Kankanabandhana.Friedrich Ratzel reported in The History of Mankind during 1896, that in Micronesia, turmeric powder was applied for embellishment of body, clothing, utensils, and ceremonial uses.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],66.72,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.32,C0682897|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.68,C2987717|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],85.18,C0026131|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],49.08,C0020498|Neonatal hemochromatosis,[dsyn],26.01,C0268059|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.48,C2350229|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Paste substance,[sbst],3.61,C0030634|furuncle,[dsyn],3.45,C0242301|Sunlight,[npop],19.21,C0038817|Fasting,[fndg],16.23,C0015663|Light,[npop],16.23,C0023693|Solutions,[sbst],6.83,C0037633|Desiccation,[npop],9.81,C0011682|Solutions,[sbst],13.43,C0037633|Heartburn,[sosy],12.89,C0018834|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Marriage, life event,[fndg],22.35,C0024841|Forests,[npop],16.04,C0086312|Wood material,[sbst],12.96,C0043217|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|"

In the early decades of the plastics industry, camphor was used in immense quantities as the plasticizer that creates celluloid from nitrocellulose, in nitrocellulose lacquers and other plastics and lacquers. 
 The sublimating capability of camphor gives it several uses.Camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent. Camphor is used as an alternative to mothballs. Camphor crystals are sometimes used to prevent damage to insect collections by other small insects. It is kept in clothes used on special occasions and festivals, and also in cupboard corners as a cockroach repellent. The smoke of camphor crystal or camphor incense sticks can be used as an environmentally-friendly mosquito repellent.Recent studies have indicated that camphor essential oil can be used as an effective fumigant against red fire ants, as it affects the attacking, climbing, and feeding behavior of major and minor workers.Camphor is also used as an antimicrobial substance. In embalming, camphor oil was one of the ingredients used by ancient Egyptians for mummification.Solid camphor releases fumes that form a rust-preventative coating and is therefore stored in tool chests to protect tools against rust. 
 The sublimating capability of camphor gives it several uses.In the ancient Arab world, Camphor was one of the most popular perfume ingredients. According to the Perfume Handbook, ""[Camphor] features in more than a quarter of al-Kindi's perfume recipes and in many other medieval Arabic works, including the Arabian Nights Tales.""

It also appears in sweet and savory dishes in the Ni'matnama, a book written in the late 15th century for the sultans of Mandu. An early international trade in it made camphor widely known throughout Arabia in pre-Islamic times, as it is mentioned in the Quran 76:5 as a flavoring for drinks.

"('camphor', 'Medicinal uses')","Camphor is readily absorbed through the skin, where it stimulates nerve endings sensitive to heat and cold, producing a warm sensation when vigorously applied, or a cool sensation when applied gently. These effects are particularly noticeable in the lungs and airways if camphor is inhaled as an aerosol. The action on nerve endings also induces a slight local analgesia.The sensation of heat that camphor produces on the skin is presumably due to activation of the ion channels TRPV3 and TRPV1, while the cool sensation due to activation of TRPM8.The global effects on the body include tachycardia (increased heart rate), vasodilation in skin (flushing), slower breathing, reduced appetite, and increased secretions and excretions such as perspiration and urination.
Camphor is toxic in large doses. It produces symptoms of irritability, disorientation, lethargy, muscle spasms, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, and seizures. Lethal doses in adults are in the range 50 500 mg/kg (orally). Generally, two grams cause serious toxicity and four grams are potentially lethal. 
 Camphor has been used in traditional medicine from time immemorial  in countries where it was native. It was probably the odor of the substance and its decongestant effect that led to its use in medicine.Camphor was used in ancient Sumatra to treat sprains, swellings, and inflammation.It has long been used as a medical substance in ancient India, where it generally goes by the name karp ra. It has been described in the 7th-century  yurvedic work M dhavacikits  as being an effective drug used for the treatment of fever. The plant has also been named hima and has been identified with the plant Cinnamomum camphora. According to the Vaidyaka- abda-sindhu, it is one of the  five flavours  used in betel-chewing, where it is also referred to as candrabhasma ( moon powder ).
Camphor also was used for centuries in Chinese medicine for a variety of purposes. 
 Camphor was a component of paregoric, an opium/camphor tincture developed in the 18th century. Paregoric was used in various formulations for hundreds of years. It was a household remedy in the 18th and 19th centuries when it was widely used to control diarrhea in adults and children, as an expectorant and cough medicine, to calm fretful children, and to rub on the gums to counteract the pain from teething. Its use declined in the 20th century after the regulation of opium.
Also in the 18th century, camphor was used by Auenbrugger in the treatment of mania, paradoxically by inducing seizures.Based on Hahnemann's writings, camphor (dissolved in alcohol) was used in the 19th century to treat the 1854 1855 cholera epidemics in Naples.In the 20th century, camphor was administered orally in small quantities (50 mg) for minor heart symptoms and fatigue. This preparation was sold under the trade name Musterole; production ceased in the 1990s.Today the main use of camphor is as a cough suppressant and as a decongestant. It is an active ingredient (along with menthol) in vapor-steam decongestant products, such as Vicks VapoRub.
Camphor is currently used in veterinary medicine. Given by intramuscular injection, it is a respiratory stimulant that aids in the treatment of breathing difficulties in horses. 
 In 1980, the US Food and Drug Administration set a limit of 11% allowable camphor in consumer products, and banned products labeled as camphorated oil, camphor oil, camphor liniment, and camphorated liniment (except ""white camphor essential oil"", which contains very little camphor.

An extract of the leaves contains hodulcine, a glycoside which exhibits an anti-sweet activity.The timber is fine and hard and is used for building construction and fine furniture.
It has been used in traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese medicines to treat fever, parasitic infection, as a laxative, and a treatment of liver diseases, and as a hangover treatment.In Thailand Hovenia dulcis is relatively rare, typically found in the stream-irrigated valleys of primary lower mountain evergreen forest located between 1,075 and 1,250 metres above sea level. However, it is one of 30 potential species identified as a substitute for Eucalyptus spp., commonly planted for reforestation, that would meet the demand for rapid growth while not disturbing the ecological balance.In Thailand Hovenia dulcis grows at roughly the same rate as eucalyptus, reaching six metres in height within three years. One major asset is that the growth form of the tree allows other species to regenerate nearby.

"('cape jasmine fruit', 'Cultivation and uses')","Gardenia plants are prized for the strong sweet scent of their flowers, which can be very large in size in some species.
Gardenia jasminoides (syn. G. grandiflora, G. Florida) is cultivated as a house plant. This species can be difficult to grow because it originated in warm humid tropical areas. It demands high humidity to thrive, and bright (not direct) light. It flourishes in acidic soils with good drainage and thrives on [68-74 F temperatures (20-23 C)] during the day and 60 F (15-16 C) in the evening. Potting soils developed especially for gardenias are available. G. jasminoides grows no larger than 18 inches in height and width when grown indoors. In climates where it can be grown outdoors, it can attain a height of 6 feet. If water touches the flowers, they will turn brown.In China and Japan, Gardenia jasminoides is called zh zi (  ) and kuchinashi ( ), respectively. Its fruit is used as a yellow dye, used on fabric and food (including the Korean mung bean jelly called hwangpomuk). Its fruits are also used in traditional Chinese medicine for their clearing, calming, and cooling properties.In France, gardenias are the flower traditionally worn by men as boutonni re when in evening dress. In The Age of Innocence, Edith Wharton suggests it was customary for upper-class men from New York City to wear a gardenia in their buttonhole during the Gilded Age.Sigmund Freud remarked to the poet H.D. that gardenias were his favorite flower.In Tiki culture, ""Donn Beach"", aka Don the Beachcomber, frequently wore a fresh lei of gardenias almost everyday at his Tiki bars, allegedly spending $7,800 for flowers over the course of four years in 1938. He named one of his drinks the Mystery Gardenia cocktail. Trader Vic frequently used the gardenia as a flower garnish in his Tiki drinks, such as in the Scorpion and Outrigger Tiara cocktails.Several species occur in Hawaii, where gardenias are known as na u or n n .
Crocetin is a chemical compound usually obtained from Crocus sativus, which can also be obtained from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides.  Gordonin is a novel methoxylated flavonol secreted in golden-colored resinous droplets of Gardenia gordonii, which is one of several critically-endangered species of the Fiji Islands.  Phytochemical studies of these resin droplets have been published, including a population-level study of two other rare, sympatric species on Vanua Levu Island of the Fiji Archipelago, G. candida and G. grievei .

"('perilla seed', 'Use')","In Manchu cuisine, perilla leaves are used to make efen, ""steamed bun""). The perilla buns are made with glutinous sorghum or glutinous rice flour dough filled with red bean paste and wrapped with perilla leaves. The dish is related to Food Extermination Day, a traditional Manchu holiday celebrated on every 26th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. 
 In India, perilla is called silam, thoiding (Meitei), Shi (Kuki), chhawhchhi (Mizo) and bhangira in
Kumaon. Perilla seeds are roasted and ground with salt, chilis, and tomatoes to make a savoury side dish or chutney. 
In  Kumaon the seeds of Bhangira (cultivated Perilla) are eaten raw, the seed oil is used for cooking purposes, and the oil cake is consumed raw or fed to cattle. The roasted seeds are also ground to prepare a spicy chutney. The seeds and leaves of Perilla are also used for flavoring curries. Manipuri cuisine uses the ground roasted seed in a salad locally known as 'singju'. 
 In Japan, the plant is called egoma and is of limited culinary importance. It is known regionally as j nen; ""ten years"") in the Northeast regions of Japan, supposedly because it adds this many years to one's lifespan. A local preparation in Fukushima Prefecture, called shingor , consists of half-pounded non-glutinous rice patties, which are skewered, smeared with miso, blended with roasted and ground j nen seeds, and roasted over charcoal. 
 In Korean cuisine, kkaennip or perilla leaves are widely used as a herb and a vegetable. Kkaennip can be used fresh as a ssam vegetable, fresh or blanched as a namul vegetable, or pickled in soy sauce or soybean paste to make jangajji (pickle) or kimchi.
Deulkkae, the perilla seeds, are either toasted and grounded into powder called deulkkae-garu or toasted and pressed to make perilla oil. Toasted deulkkae powder is used as a spice and a condiment for guk (soup), namul (seasoned vegetable dishes), guksu (noodle dishes), kimchi, and eomuk (fishcake). It is also used as gomul (coating or topping) for desserts: Yeot and several tteok (rice cake) varieties can be coated with toasted perilla powder. Perilla oil made from toasted perilla seeds is used as a cooking oil and as a condiment.
In Korean-style western food, perilla leaves are sometimes used to substitute basil, and the seed powder and oil is used in salad dressings as well as in dipping sauces. A Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul serves nutty vanilla ice cream whose secret ingredient is perilla oil. 
 In Nepal, perilla is called silam (     ).

"('root of japanese ampelopsis ', 'Cultivation and uses')","Parthenocissus quinquefolia is grown as an ornamental plant, because of its ability to rapidly cover walls and buildings, and its deep red to burgundy fall (autumn) foliage.It is frequently seen covering telephone poles or trees. It may kill other plants it covers by shading its support and thus limiting the supporting plants' ability to photosynthesize. With its aggressive growth, it can overburden slower-growing understory trees with its weight, damaging them. Its ability to propagate via its extensive root system makes it difficult to eradicate. This plant is listed on Schedule 9 of the UK Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as an invasive non-native species. While this does not prevent it from being sold in the UK, or from being grown in gardens, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) encourages those that do grow it to take great care with managing it and with disposing of unwanted material. The RHS also encourages gardeners to find alternative plants to grow to those listed on Schedule 9. For suggested alternative plants see the Plantlife/RHS guide: Gardening without harmful invasive plants 
Parthenocissus quinquefolia can be used as a shading vine for buildings on masonry walls.  Because the vine, like its relative P. tricuspidata (Boston ivy), adheres to the surface by disks rather than penetrating roots, it does not harm the masonry but will keep a building cooler by shading the wall surface during the summer. As with ivy, ripping the plant from the wall will leave the adhesive disks behind. If the plant clings to fragile surfaces it can first be killed by severing the vine from the root. The adhesive pads will then eventually deteriorate and release their grip.  This plant should be trimmed regularly to keep it from growing into areas where it is not wanted.  If allowed to penetrate into the wall of a frame house, it will grow upward within the wall until it finds a place to emerge. 
The roots can penetrate a rock foundation and grow into the basement of an old house, extending long distances in search of moisture, and growing into floor cracks or drains.","Ability,[orga],40.06,C0085732|Vision,[orgf],33.67,C0042789|Body Weight,[orga],22.36,C0005910|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.17,C0040452|Aggressive behavior,[inbe],12.96,C0001807|Growth,[orgf],9.99,C0018270|Patient Discharge,[hlca],20.95,C0030685|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.05,C0040452|Influenza,[dsyn],14.64,C0021400|grasp,[orgf],5.18,C0220843|"
"('root of chinese pulsatilla', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('root of chinese pulsatilla', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

"('chinese lobelia herb', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('chinese lobelia herb', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, The amount of ginsenosides in Chinese ginseng depends on how the plant was cultivated and the age of the root. Wild Chinese ginseng, believed to be of highest TCM quality, has become rare in its natural habitat, so natural fostering efforts are utilized to emulate the wild variety.  Chinese ginseng can be white or red, depending on how it is processed.  White Chinese ginseng is unprocessed and dried naturally. Red Chinese ginseng is processed with steam and, in TCM, is believed to be more potent.

These are generally high species with bright, showy flowers, such as ruby cinquefoil (P. atrosanguinea), Nepal cinquefoil (P. nepalensis), and sulphur cinquefoil (P. recta). Horticultural hybrids such as Hopwood's cinquefoil (Potentilla   hopwoodiana) and tongue cinquefoil (Potentilla   tonguei) have been bred, and there exists a range of cultivars. Some double-flowered cinquefoils have been bred, starting with Victor Lemoine's 'Gloire de Nancy' in 1854. Other taxa and varieties are useful for more specialized gardening purposes, such as rock gardens or swamps. Among the former is the hardy spring cinquefoil (P. neumanniana), the floral emblem of Cromartyshire. 
 Some species are used in herbalism. Common tormentil (P. erecta), for example, has been used as an herbal remedy for inflammation and gastrointestinal disorders. Research continues to determine its safety and usefulness as an alternative medicine for such disorders as ulcerative colitis. Potentilla discolor and P. multifida are Chinese medicinal herbs used to treat diabetes.

"('flower of hyacinth dolichos', 'Uses')","The hyacinth bean is an old domesticated pulse and multi-purpose crop. Due to seed availability of one forage cultivar (cv. Rongai), it is often grown as forage for livestock and as an ornamental plant. In addition, it is cited both as a medicinal plant and a poisonous plant.The fruit and beans are edible if boiled well with several changes of the water. Otherwise, they are toxic due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides, glycosides that are converted to hydrogen cyanide when consumed. Signs of poisoning include weakness, vomiting, dyspnea, twitching, stupor, and convulsions. It has been shown that there is a wide range of cyanogenic potential among the varieties.The leaves are eaten raw or cooked like spinach. The flowers can be eaten raw or steamed. The root can be boiled or baked for food. The seeds are used to make tofu and tempeh.In India its called  Surti Papdi . In Bangladesh and West Bengal, the green pods along with the beans, known as Sheem (   ), are cooked as vegetables or cooked with fish as a curry.
In China, the seeds are known as Bai Bian Dou. They are usually dried and baked before being used in traditional Chinese herbal remedies to strengthen spleen, reduce heat and dampness, and promote appetite. In Kerala, it is known as Amarakka, Avara or Amara Payar (Malayalam:         ). The beans as well as the bean pods are used in cooking curries. The bean pods are also used (along with spices) for preparing stir-fried dish known as Thoran.In Maharashtra, dry preparations with green masala is often made out of these green beans (Ghevda varieties - Shravan ghevda (french beans), Bajirao Ghevda, Ghevda, Walwar, Pavta sheng..) mostly found at the end of monsoon during fasting festivals of Shravan month.In Karnataka, the hyacinth bean is made into curry (avarekalu saaru)(Kannada:              ), salad (avarekaalu usli), added to upma (avrekaalu uppittu), and as a flavoring to Akki rotti. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called hitakubele avarekalu, which means ""pressed (hitaku) hyancinth bean,"" and a curry known as Hitikida Avarekaalu Saaru is made out of the deskinned beans.In Telangana and Andra Pradesh, the bean pods are cut into small pieces and cooked as spicy curry in Pongal festival season. Sometimes the outer peel of the seed when tender and soaked over night is taken out and the inner soft part is used for a variety of dishes. This form is called pitakapappu,hanupa/anapa, which means ""pressed (pitaku) hyancinth bean, and a curry known as Pitikida Anapaginjala Chaaru is made out of this deskinned beans along with bajra bread; it has been a very special delicacy for centuries.In Hu , Vietnam, hyacinth beans are the main ingredient of the dish ch    u v n (Hyacinth Bean Sweet Soup).In Kenya, the bean called 'Njahe' is popular among several communities, especially the Kikuyu. Seasons were actually based on it i.e the Season of Njahe (K mera k a njah ). It is thought to encourage lactation and has historically been the main dish for breastfeeding mothers. Beans are boiled and mashed with ripe and/or semi-ripe bananas, giving the dish a sweet taste.  Today the production is in decline in eastern Africa. This is partly attributed to the fact that under colonial rule in Kenya, farmers were forced to give up their local bean in order to produce common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) for export.","Eating,[orgf],26.03,C0013470|Stupor,[mobd],24.11,C0085628|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Pulse Rate,[clna],16.21,C0232117|Multiple Chronic Conditions,[dsyn],16.07,C3266262|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Dyspnea,[sosy],14.64,C0013404|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|furuncle,[dsyn],8.00,C0242301|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.74,C0010352|Poisoning,[inpo],6.60,C0032343|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],104.76,C0020498|Breast Feeding,[orgf],38.95,C0006147|Desiccation,[npop],19.89,C0011682|Festivals,[acty],19.75,C0015922|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Desire for food,[orgf],17.80,C0003618|Spleen,[bpoc],17.80,C0037993|Fasting,[fndg],16.04,C0015663|Lactation,[ortf],14.64,C0022925|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.14,C0039336|Cyclic neutropenia,[dsyn],12.88,C0221023|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Heat (physical force),[npop],5.18,C0018837|furuncle,[dsyn],3.98,C0242301|"
"('kusnezoff monkshood root', 'Toxicology')","Monkshood and other members of the genus Aconitum contain substantial amounts of the highly toxic aconitine and related alkaloids, especially in their roots and tubers.  Aconitine is a potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin that causes persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues. The influx of sodium through these channels and the delay in their repolarization increases their excitability and may lead to diarrhea, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmia and death.
Marked symptoms may appear almost immediately, usually not later than one hour, and ""with large doses death is almost instantaneous"". Death usually occurs within two to six hours in fatal poisoning (20 to 40 ml of tincture may prove fatal). The initial signs are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This is followed by a sensation of burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth and face, and of burning in the abdomen. In severe poisonings, pronounced motor weakness occurs and cutaneous sensations of tingling and numbness spread to the limbs. Cardiovascular features include hypotension, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias. Other features may include sweating, dizziness, difficulty in breathing, headache, and confusion. The main causes of death are ventricular arrhythmias and asystole, or paralysis of the heart or respiratory center. The only post mortem signs are those of asphyxia.Treatment of poisoning is mainly supportive. All patients require close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal can be used if given within one hour of ingestion. The major physiological antidote is atropine, which is used to treat bradycardia. Other drugs used for ventricular arrhythmia include lidocaine, amiodarone, bretylium, flecainide, procainamide, and mexiletine. Cardiopulmonary bypass is used if symptoms are refractory to treatment with these drugs. Successful use of charcoal hemoperfusion has been claimed in patients with severe aconitine poisoning.Severe toxicity is not expected from skin contact; however paraesthesia has been reported, as has mild toxicity (headache, nausea and palpitations).","Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.05,C0011991|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],9.99,C0003811|Heart Ventricle,[bpoc],9.99,C0018827|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.63,C0020517|Neurons,[cell],6.54,C0027882|Body tissue,[tisu],3.63,C0040300|Paresthesia,[dsyn],59.11,C0030554|Hypesthesia,[fndg],39.21,C0020580|Headache,[sosy],35.81,C0018681|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],30.31,C0003811|Heart Ventricle,[bpoc],30.31,C0018827|Nausea,[sosy],29.46,C0027497|Poisoning,[inpo],27.54,C0032343|Bradycardia,[fndg],26.74,C0428977|Cause of Death,[fndg],22.61,C0007465|Respiratory Center,[bpoc],20.95,C0035216|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.30,C0011065|Esthesia,[ortf],19.85,C0036658|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Sweating,[fndg],17.80,C0038990|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Blood Pressure,[orgf],16.08,C0005823|Systemic arterial pressure,[fndg],16.08,C1272641|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Heart,[bpoc],13.45,C0018787|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Asphyxia,[patf],13.05,C0004044|Paralysed,[fndg],13.03,C0522224|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],11.49,C0018790|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|pathologic fistula,[anab],9.99,C0016169|Limb structure,[bpoc],6.72,C0015385|"
"('kusnezoff monkshood root', 'Uses')","The roots of A. ferox supply the Nepalese poison called bikh, bish, or nabee. It contains large quantities of the alkaloid pseudaconitine, which is a deadly poison. The root of A. luridum, of the Himalaya, is said to be as poisonous as that of A. ferox or A. napellus.Several species of Aconitum have been used as arrow poisons. The Minaro in Ladakh use A. napellus on their arrows to hunt ibex, while the Ainu in Japan used a species of Aconitum to hunt bear. The Chinese also used Aconitum poisons both for hunting and for warfare. Aconitum poisons were used by the Aleuts of Alaska's Aleutian Islands for hunting whales. Usually, one man in a kayak armed with a poison-tipped lance would hunt the whale, paralyzing
it with the poison and causing it to drown.

"('armand clematis stem', 'Use and toxicity')","The European species did not enter into the herbalists' pharmacopeia. In the American Old West, the Western white clematis, Clematis ligusticifolia, was called pepper vine by early travelers and pioneers, who took a tip from Spanish colonials and used seeds and the acrid leaves of yerba de chivato as a pepper substitute. The entire genus contains essential oils and compounds which are extremely irritating to the skin and mucous membranes.  Unlike black pepper or Capsicum, however, the compounds in clematis cause internal bleeding of the digestive tract if ingested in large amounts. C. ligusticifolia is essentially toxic. When pruning them, it is a good idea to wear gloves. Despite its toxicity, Native Americans used very small amounts of clematis as an effective treatment for migraine headaches and nervous disorders. It was also used as an effective treatment of skin infections. Clematis is also a constituent of Bach's Rescue Remedy.  Leaf extracts from two Ethiopian species (Clematis longicauda steud ex A. Rich. and Clematis burgensis Engl.) are used locally to treat ear disorders and eczema.  Phytochemical screening of the extracts from both of these species showed antibacterial and antifungal activity. The extracts of these plants also possess wound healing and anti-inflammatory activities which could also be attributed to the phytoconstituents.Clematis has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health.

"('root of common monkshood', 'Toxicology')","Monkshood and other members of the genus Aconitum contain substantial amounts of the highly toxic aconitine and related alkaloids, especially in their roots and tubers.  Aconitine is a potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin that causes persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues. The influx of sodium through these channels and the delay in their repolarization increases their excitability and may lead to diarrhea, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmia and death.
Marked symptoms may appear almost immediately, usually not later than one hour, and ""with large doses death is almost instantaneous"". Death usually occurs within two to six hours in fatal poisoning (20 to 40 ml of tincture may prove fatal). The initial signs are gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This is followed by a sensation of burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth and face, and of burning in the abdomen. In severe poisonings, pronounced motor weakness occurs and cutaneous sensations of tingling and numbness spread to the limbs. Cardiovascular features include hypotension, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias. Other features may include sweating, dizziness, difficulty in breathing, headache, and confusion. The main causes of death are ventricular arrhythmias and asystole, or paralysis of the heart or respiratory center. The only post mortem signs are those of asphyxia.Treatment of poisoning is mainly supportive. All patients require close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal can be used if given within one hour of ingestion. The major physiological antidote is atropine, which is used to treat bradycardia. Other drugs used for ventricular arrhythmia include lidocaine, amiodarone, bretylium, flecainide, procainamide, and mexiletine. Cardiopulmonary bypass is used if symptoms are refractory to treatment with these drugs. Successful use of charcoal hemoperfusion has been claimed in patients with severe aconitine poisoning.Severe toxicity is not expected from skin contact; however paraesthesia has been reported, as has mild toxicity (headache, nausea and palpitations).","Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.05,C0011991|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],9.99,C0003811|Heart Ventricle,[bpoc],9.99,C0018827|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.63,C0020517|Neurons,[cell],6.54,C0027882|Body tissue,[tisu],3.63,C0040300|Paresthesia,[dsyn],59.11,C0030554|Hypesthesia,[fndg],39.21,C0020580|Headache,[sosy],35.81,C0018681|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],30.31,C0003811|Heart Ventricle,[bpoc],30.31,C0018827|Nausea,[sosy],29.46,C0027497|Poisoning,[inpo],27.54,C0032343|Bradycardia,[fndg],26.74,C0428977|Cause of Death,[fndg],22.61,C0007465|Respiratory Center,[bpoc],20.95,C0035216|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.30,C0011065|Esthesia,[ortf],19.85,C0036658|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Sweating,[fndg],17.80,C0038990|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Blood Pressure,[orgf],16.08,C0005823|Systemic arterial pressure,[fndg],16.08,C1272641|Diarrhea,[sosy],14.64,C0011991|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Heart,[bpoc],13.45,C0018787|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Asphyxia,[patf],13.05,C0004044|Paralysed,[fndg],13.03,C0522224|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],11.49,C0018790|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|pathologic fistula,[anab],9.99,C0016169|Limb structure,[bpoc],6.72,C0015385|"

"('garlic', 'Uses')","Garlic is widely used around the world for its pungent flavor as a seasoning or condiment.
The garlic plant's bulb is the most commonly used part of the plant. With the exception of the single clove types, garlic bulbs are normally divided into numerous fleshy sections called cloves. Garlic cloves are used for consumption (raw or cooked) or for medicinal purposes. They have a characteristic pungent, spicy flavor that mellows and sweetens considerably with cooking.Other parts of the garlic plant are also edible. The leaves and flowers (bulbils) on the head (spathe) are sometimes eaten. They are milder in flavor than the bulbs, and are most often consumed while immature and still tender. Immature garlic is sometimes pulled, rather like a scallion, and sold as ""green garlic"". When green garlic is allowed to grow past the ""scallion"" stage, but not permitted to fully mature, it may produce a garlic ""round"", a bulb like a boiling onion, but not separated into cloves like a mature bulb. It imparts a garlic flavor and aroma in food, minus the spiciness. Green garlic is often chopped and stir-fried or cooked in soup or hot pot in Southeast Asian (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Myanmar, Lao, Cambodian, Singaporean), and Chinese cookery, and is very abundant and low-priced. Additionally, the immature flower stalks (scapes) of the hardneck and elephant types are sometimes marketed for uses similar to asparagus in stir-fries.Inedible or rarely eaten parts of the garlic plant include the ""skin"" covering each clove and root cluster. The papery, protective layers of ""skin"" over various parts of the plant are generally discarded during preparation for most culinary uses, though in Korea immature whole heads are sometimes prepared with the tender skins intact. The root cluster attached to the basal plate of the bulb is the only part not typically considered palatable in any form. An alternative is to cut the top off the bulb, coat the cloves by dribbling olive oil (or other oil-based seasoning) over them, and roast them in an oven. Garlic softens and can be extracted from the cloves by squeezing the (root) end of the bulb, or individually by squeezing one end of the clove. In Korea, heads of garlic are heated over the course of several weeks; the resulting product, called black garlic, is sweet and syrupy, and is exported to the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.
Garlic may be applied to different kinds of bread, usually in a medium of butter or oil, to create a variety of classic dishes, such as garlic bread, garlic toast, bruschetta, crostini, and canap . The flavor varies in intensity and aroma with the different cooking methods. It is often paired with onion, tomato, or ginger.
Immature scapes are tender and edible. They are also known as ""garlic spears"", ""stems"", or ""tops"". Scapes generally have a milder taste than the cloves. They are often used in stir frying or braised like asparagus. Garlic leaves are a popular vegetable in many parts of Asia. The leaves are cut, cleaned, and then stir-fried with eggs, meat, or vegetables.
Garlic powder has a different taste from fresh garlic. If used as a substitute for fresh garlic, 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder is approximate to one clove of garlic.Garlic is a fundamental component in many or most dishes of various regions, including eastern Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, northern Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Latin America. Latin American seasonings, particularly, use garlic in sofritos and mofongos.Oils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of vegetables, meats, breads, and pasta. Garlic, along with fish sauce, chopped fresh chilis, lime juice, sugar, and water, is a basic essential item in dipping fish sauce, a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in Indochina. In East and Southeast Asia, chili oil with garlic is a popular dipping sauce, especially for meat and seafood. Tuong ot toi Viet Nam (Vietnam chili garlic sauce) is a highly popular condiment and dip across North America and Asia.
In some cuisines, the young bulbs are pickled for three to six weeks in a mixture of sugar, salt, and spices. In eastern Europe, the shoots are pickled and eaten as an appetizer. Laba garlic, prepared by soaking garlic in vinegar, is a type of pickled garlic served with dumplings in northern China to celebrate the Chinese New Year.Garlic is essential in Middle Eastern and Arabic cooking, with its presence in many food items. In Levantine countries such as Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon, garlic is traditionally crushed together with olive oil, and occasionally salt, to create a Middle Eastern garlic sauce called Toum (    ; meaning ""garlic"" in Arabic). While not exclusively served with meats, toum is commonly paired with chicken or other meat dishes such as shawarma. Garlic is also a key component in hummus, an Arabic dip composed of chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and salt.
Lightly smoked garlic is used in British and other European cuisine. It is particularly prized for stuffing poultry and game, and in soups and stews.
Emulsifying garlic with olive oil produces aioli. Garlic, oil, and a chunky base produce skordalia. Blending garlic, almond, oil, and soaked bread produces ajoblanco. Tzatziki, yogurt mixed with garlic and salt, is a common sauce in Eastern Mediterranean cuisines. 
 Domestically, garlic is stored warm [above 18  C (64  F)] and dry to keep it dormant (to inhibit sprouting). It is traditionally hung; softneck varieties are often braided in strands called plaits or grappes. Peeled cloves may be stored in wine or vinegar in the refrigerator. Commercially, garlic is stored at 0  C (32  F), in a dry, low-humidity environment. Garlic will keep longer if the tops remain attached.Garlic is often kept in oil to produce flavored oil; however, the practice requires measures to be taken to prevent the garlic from spoiling which may include rancidity and growth of Clostridium botulinum. Acidification with a mild solution of vinegar minimizes bacterial growth. Refrigeration does not assure the safety of garlic kept in oil, requiring use within one month to avoid bacterial spoilage. 
 The use of garlic in China dates back thousands of years. It was consumed by ancient Greek and Roman soldiers, sailors, and rural classes (Virgil, Eclogues ii. 11), and, according to Pliny the Elder (Natural History xix. 32), by the African peasantry. Galen eulogized it as the ""rustic's theriac"" (cure-all) (see F. Adams' Paulus Aegineta, p. 99), and Alexander Neckam, a writer of the 12th century (see Wright's edition of his works, p. 473, 1863), discussed it as a palliative for the heat of the sun in field labor. Garlic was placed by the ancient Greeks on the piles of stones at crossroads, as a supper for Hecate (Theophrastus, Characters, The Superstitious Man). According to Pliny, garlic and onions were invoked as deities by the Egyptians at the taking of oaths. In his Natural History, Pliny gives a list of scenarios in which garlic was considered beneficial (N.H. xx. 23). In the 17th century Dr Thomas Sydenham valued it as an application in confluent smallpox, and William Cullen's Materia Medica of 1789  found some dropsies cured by it alone.
Garlic was rare in traditional English cuisine (though it is said to have been grown in England before 1548) and has been a common ingredient in Mediterranean Europe. Translations of the c. 1300 Assize of Weights and Measures indicate a passage as dealing with standardized units of garlic production, sale, and taxation   the hundred of 15 ropes of 15 heads each   but the Latin version of the text refers to herring rather than garlic. Garlic was used as an antiseptic to prevent gangrene during World War I and World War II. 
 In the typical serving size of 1 3 cloves (3 9 grams), garlic provides no significant nutritional value, with the content of all essential nutrients below 10% of the Daily Value (DV) (table). When expressed per 100 grams, garlic contains several nutrients in rich amounts (20% or more of the DV), including vitamins B6 and C, and the dietary minerals manganese and phosphorus. Per 100 gram serving, garlic is also a moderate source (10 19% DV) of certain B vitamins, including thiamin and pantothenic acid, as well as the dietary minerals calcium, iron, and zinc (table).
The composition of raw garlic is 59% water, 33% carbohydrates, 6% protein, 2% dietary fiber, and less than 1% fat. 
 As of 2015, clinical research to determine the possible effects of consuming garlic on hypertension has found no clear effect. A 2016 meta-analysis indicated there was no effect of garlic consumption on blood levels of lipoprotein(a), a biomarker of atherosclerosis. Because garlic might reduce platelet aggregation, people taking anticoagulant medication are cautioned about consuming garlic. 
 A 2016 meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies found a moderate inverse association between garlic intake and some cancers of the upper digestive tract. Another meta-analysis found decreased rates of stomach cancer associated with garlic intake, but cited confounding factors as limitations for interpreting these studies. Further meta-analyses found similar results on the incidence of stomach cancer by consuming allium vegetables including garlic. A 2014 meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies found that garlic consumption was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in Korean people.A 2016 meta-analysis found no effect of garlic on colorectal cancer. A 2014 meta-analysis found garlic supplements or allium vegetables to have no effect on colorectal cancers.A 2013 meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies found limited evidence for an association between higher garlic consumption and reduced risk of prostate cancer, but the studies were suspected as having publication bias. A 2013 meta-analysis of epidemiological studies found garlic intake to be associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer. 
 A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. Other reviews concluded a similar absence of high-quality evidence for garlic having a significant effect on the common cold. 
 The sticky juice within the bulb cloves is used as an adhesive in mending glass and porcelain. An environmentally benign garlic-derived polysulfide product is approved for use in the European Union (under Annex 1 of 91/414) and the UK as a nematicide and insecticide, including for use for control of cabbage root fly and red mite in poultry. 
 Garlic is known to cause bad breath (halitosis) and body odor, described as a pungent ""garlicky"" smell to sweat. This is caused by allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). AMS is a volatile liquid which is absorbed into the blood during the metabolism of garlic-derived sulfur compounds; from the blood it travels to the lungs (and from there to the mouth, causing bad breath; see garlic breath) and skin, where it is exuded through skin pores. Washing the skin with soap is only a partial and imperfect solution to the smell. Studies have shown sipping milk at the same time as consuming garlic can significantly neutralize bad breath. Mixing garlic with milk in the mouth before swallowing reduced the odor better than drinking milk afterward. Plain water, mushrooms, and basil may also reduce the odor; the mix of fat and water found in milk, however, was the most effective.The green, dry ""folds"" in the center of the garlic clove are especially pungent. The sulfur compound allicin, produced by crushing or chewing fresh garlic, produces other sulfur compounds: ajoene, allyl polysulfides, and vinyldithiins. Aged garlic lacks allicin, but may have some activity due to the presence of S-allylcysteine.
Some people suffer from allergies to garlic and other species of Allium. Symptoms can include irritable bowel, diarrhea, mouth and throat ulcerations, nausea, breathing difficulties, and, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Garlic-sensitive people show positive tests to diallyl disulfide, allylpropyldisulfide, allylmercaptan, and allicin, all of which are present in garlic. People who suffer from garlic allergies are often sensitive to many other plants, including onions, chives, leeks, shallots, garden lilies, ginger, and bananas.
Several reports of serious burns resulting from garlic being applied topically for various purposes, including naturopathic uses and acne treatment, indicate care must be taken for these uses, usually testing a small area of skin using a low concentration of garlic. On the basis of numerous reports of such burns, including burns to children, topical use of raw garlic, as well as insertion of raw garlic into body cavities, is discouraged. In particular, topical application of raw garlic to young children is not advisable.The side effects of long-term garlic supplementation are largely unknown. Possible side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, sweating, dizziness, allergic reactions, bleeding, and menstrual irregularities.Some breastfeeding mothers have found, after consuming garlic, that their babies can be slow to feed, and have noted a garlic odor coming from them.If higher-than-recommended doses of garlic are taken with anticoagulant medications, this can lead to a higher risk of bleeding. Garlic may interact with warfarin, saquinavir, antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, the quinolone family of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, and hypoglycemic drugs, as well as other medications.
Alliums might be toxic to cats or dogs. 
 In folklore, garlic has been regarded as a force for both good and evil. In Europe, many cultures have used garlic for protection or white magic, perhaps owing to its reputation in folk medicine. Central European folk beliefs considered garlic a powerful ward against demons, werewolves, and vampires. To ward off vampires, garlic could be worn, hung in windows, or rubbed on chimneys and keyholes.In the foundation myth of the ancient Korean kingdom of Gojoseon, eating nothing but 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of Korean mugwort for 100 days let a bear be transformed into a woman.In celebration of Nowruz (Persian calendar New Year), garlic is one of the items in a Seven-Seen table, a traditional New Year's display.
In Islam, it is recommended not to eat raw garlic prior to going to the mosque.

"('pith of common rush', '20th century')","Pith helmets were widely worn during World War I by British, Belgian, French, Austrian-Hungarian and German troops fighting in the Middle East and Africa. During the 1930s the locally recruited forces maintained in the Philippines, (consisting of the army and a gendarmerie), used sun helmets mostly made out of compressed coconut fiber called ""Guinit"". The Axis Second Philippine Republic's military, known as the Bureau of Constabulary, as well as guerrilla groups in the Philippines also wore this headdress.

Helmets of this style (but without true pith construction) were used as late as World War II by Japanese, European and American military personnel in hot climates. Included in this category are the sun helmets worn in Ethiopia and North Africa by Italian troops, the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, Union Defence Force, and Nazi Germany's Afrika Korps, as well as similar helmets used to a more limited extent by U.S. and Japanese forces in the Pacific Theater.The Ethiopian Imperial Guard retained pith helmets as a distinctive part of their uniform until the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974. Imperial Guard units serving in the Korean War often wore these helmets when not in combat.

In the British Army a khaki version was frequently worn, ornamented with a regimental cap badge or flash. The full-dress white helmet varied further from regiment to regiment: several regiments had distinctive puggarees or hackles. On ceremonial occasions the helmet was topped with a spike (for infantry and cavalry regiments, for the Army Ordnance Corps and the Royal Engineers) or a ball (for the Royal Artillery and other corps); and general officers, staff officers and certain departmental officers, when in full dress, wore plumes on their helmets, similar to those worn on their full-dress cocked hats. The British Army formally abolished the tropical helmet (other than for ceremonial purposes) in 1948. 
 While not usually perceived as a headdress suitable for sea wear, a white tropical helmet was issued to personnel of the French Navy serving in the Red Sea, Far Eastern waters and the Pacific between 1922 and the 1940s.Prior to World War I the British and other navies had sometimes provided pith helmets for landing parties in tropical regions.  Prior to the Second World War, Royal Navy officers wore the Wolseley helmet when in white (tropical) uniform; the helmet was plain white, with a narrow navy-blue edging to the top of the puggaree.
American naval officers could wear a pith helmet with the tropical khaki uniform.  Most often the pith helmet was worn by the U. S. Navy's Civil Engineer Corps. 
 Through the first half of the 20th century, the Wolseley pattern helmet was routinely worn with civil uniform by British colonial, diplomatic and consular officials serving in 'hot climates'. It was worn with a gilt badge of the royal arms at the front. When worn by governors and governors-general, the helmet was topped by a 10-inch red and white swan-feather plume. British diplomats in tropical postings, governors-general, governors and colonial officials continued to wear the traditional white helmets as part of their ceremonial white uniforms until Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials ceased to wear such dress in the late 20th century as an economy measure. The ceremonies marking the end of British rule in Hong Kong in 1997 featured the Royal Hong Kong Police aide-de-camp to the Governor in a white Wolseley pith helmet with black and white feathers, and was probably the last occasion on which this style of headdress appeared as a symbol of Empire. 
 Such was the popularity of the pith helmet that it became common civilian headgear for Westerners in the tropics and sub-tropics from the mid-19th century. The civilian pith helmet usually had the same dimensions and outline as its contemporary military counterpart, but without decorative extras such as badges. It was worn by men and women, old and young, on formal and casual occasions, until the 1940s. Both white and khaki versions were used. It was often worn together with civilian versions of khaki drill and/or bush jackets.

Until the 1950s there was a widespread assumption that wearing this form of head-dress was necessary for people of European origin to avoid sunstroke in the tropics. By contrast, indigenous peoples were assumed to have acquired a relative immunity. Modern medical opinion holds that some form of wide brimmed but light headwear (such as a Panama hat etc.) is highly advisable in strong sunlight for people of all ethnicities to avoid skin cancers and overheating.
Pith helmets began to decline in popularity in the mid-1950s. For example, they had become relatively uncommon in Francophone African colonies by 1955, despite their former conspicuous popularity among European visitors and expatriates there during the previous decade.","World War I,[acty],19.45,C1449759|Sunlight,[npop],19.25,C0038817|Axis vertebra,[bpoc],19.23,C0004457|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.88,C0027627|Maintenance,[acty],6.69,C0024501|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.35,C2350229|World War II,[evnt],19.41,C0681710|Korean War,[acty],19.38,C1449776|Sunlight,[npop],19.27,C0038817|Climate,[npop],16.04,C0008946|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],49.29,C3541994|World War I,[acty],20.95,C1449759|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|Perception,[menp],9.88,C0030971|Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma,[neop],22.47,C0206655|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.40,C2350229|Climate,[npop],16.25,C0008946|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],16.16,C3541994|Feathers,[bpoc],13.27,C0015731|Sunlight,[npop],19.20,C0038817|Light,[npop],16.12,C0023693|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],16.05,C3541994|Sunstroke,[inpo],13.03,C0038819|Heat Stroke,[inpo],11.49,C0018843|Malignant neoplasm of skin,[neop],5.18,C0007114|"
"('pith of common rush', 'Modern use')","The pith helmet is still used by a number of military units throughout the Commonwealth.

In the United Kingdom, the Royal Marines wear white Wolseley pattern helmets of the same general design as the old pith helmet as part of their number 1 or dress uniform. These date from 1912 in their present form and are made of natural cork covered in white cloth on the outside and shade green on the inside. Decoration includes a brass ball ornament at the top (a detail inherited from the Royal Marine Artillery), helmet plate and chin chain.
The Home Service helmet is still worn, as part of full dress uniform, by line infantry regiments in the United Kingdom today. Although the wearing of full dress uniform by these units largely ceased after World War I, it continues to be worn by regimental bands, Corps of Drums and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions. Such personnel are likewise directed to wear the Foreign Service helmet (either colonial pattern or Wolseley pattern according to regimental specification) when full dress uniform is worn ""in hot weather overseas stations such as Cyprus"".

The Royal Gibraltar Regiment routinely wear the white pith helmet with a white tunic (in summer) and scarlet tunic (in winter).
Within the British Overseas Territories a white Wolseley helmet with red and white swan-feather plume is still occasionally worn by Governors of colonial territories when in white tropical uniform. Since 2001 such dress has been provided only at the expense of the territory concerned and is no longer paid for by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

The Wolseley pattern continues to be used by the Canadian Army for ceremonial purposes. Throughout the Primary Reserve, the ceremonial dress uniforms for a number of armour and infantry regiments utilize the Wolseley helmet. The Royal Canadian Regiment and Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry of the Canadian Army's Regular Forces also use the Wolseley design (marked with a red and French grey puggaree respectively). In addition, the pith helmet is also worn by cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada for certain parades and special occasions. The pith helmet is also used by Australian military bands, such as the Army Band and the Royal Military College Duntroon band, as well as the New South Wales Mounted Police, and the Band of the South Australia Police. 
 Throughout World War II, the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and the U. S. Army used a cheaper version of the pith helmet, called the American fiber helmet, which was made from pressed fiber. Some of the helmets were printed with a camouflage pattern. The two main producers of the US military fiber pressed pith helmet were the International Hat Company and Hawley Products Company.  Both companies had originally designed and manufactured several civilian models made from pressed fiber with a foil lining in the 1930s, aimed to be used by laborers who worked in the hot sun, from farms to road construction to other manual labor. The U.S. Marine Corps pith helmet (officially ""Helmet, sun, rigid, fiber"") has also seen use as a form of identification by rifle range cadres; similarly the campaign hat is worn by rifle range instructors and drill instructors. White, or in some places light blue, sun helmets of plastic material but traditional design are still worn today by some mail carriers of the U.S. Postal Service, when delivering the mail on foot in hot climates such as Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Florida, Southern California, Arizona, and Hawaii, or during rainy weather.  The U.S. Navy also authorized a plastic khaki sun helmet for wear by officers in tropical regions during the mid-20th century. It was decorated with a full-size officer's hat crest on the front.
A pith helmet with a feather plume is part of the uniform of the Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps, from Rockford, Illinois. 
 A dark blue pith helmet, similar to the British Home Service helmet, is worn with the ceremonial uniforms of the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene and the Netherlands Marine Corps. 
 After World War II, the communist Viet Minh and later the People's Army of Vietnam of the North based their helmet design called m  c i on the French pith helmet of the former colonial power and adopted it as their own. Today it is still widely worn by civilians in Vietnam (mostly in the North, but its use declined sharply in 2007 when the motorbike helmet became mandatory for motorbike riders). In design, the Vietnamese model was similar to the pre-World War II civilian type, but covered in jungle green cloth, sometimes with a metal insignia at the front. 
 Pith helmets are worn by the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince of Monaco and by the Sri Lankan Police as part of their dress uniform. In the Philippines some ceremonial units such as the Presidential Security Group and the National Police use sun helmets. They are also used by the Royal Guards of the Royal Thai Army.

In the Dominican Republic, pith helmets with black pugarees were the standard duty headgear used by highway traffic officers of the national police until the beginning of the 21st century, when these units were replaced by the creation of the Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte (AMET) corps, who were issued dark green stetson hats instead.
White Wolseley helmets are worn by mounted Presidential Guard members in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the opening of the first session of every parliament.A khaki or white pith helmet is part of the standard summer uniform of traffic officers in certain police departments in India.
Modern Italian municipal police wear a helmet modeled on the Model 1928 tropical helmet of the Royal Italian Army for foot patrols in summer. These are made from white plastic with cork or pith interior lining and resemble the British Custodian helmet, though taller and narrower. 
 The pith helmet has had a limited comeback in recent years, with their now novel appearance and genuine functionality making the headdress increasingly popular for gardening, hiking, safari and other outdoor activities. Today's helmets are generally available in four basic types (see below). These have changed little since the early 1900s, except that for easier adjustment the inner headband utilises hook-and-loop fasteners (e.g., Velcro) instead of the earlier brass pins. They can also be soaked in water to keep the wearer's head cool in hot weather, and feature an adjustable chinstrap towards the front.
(i) French pith helmet. This is the most functional of the helmets, with its wide brim providing more sun protection than the more narrow-brimmed variations. This helmet is mostly made in Vietnam, where the design was inherited from French colonial patterns.
(ii) Indian pith helmet. The Indian model is almost exactly the same as the French one, but with a slightly narrower brim and a squarer dome. It shares with other helmets the ventilation ""button"" atop the dome.
(iii) African pith helmet, or safari helmet, is a variation mainly used in savanna or jungle regions of Africa. It is generally a khaki-grey colour, with the same dimensions and shape as the Indian helmet described above.
(iv) Wolseley pith helmet. This variation of the helmet was named after (but not designed by) Sir Garnet Wolseley and widely used by the British Army and Colonial civil service from 1900. The Wolseley helmet differs from other pith helmets in having a more sloping brim with an apex at the front and back. The dome is also taller and more conical than the other more rounded variations. It is the helmet often portrayed as being worn by stereotypical ""Gentleman Explorers"". 
 The pith helmet was widely used by European colonial armies in Africa and Asia. As such, it is considered by some critics to be a symbol of colonialism.In 2018, First Lady Melania Trump received criticism for wearing an American fiber helmet (also known as an American pith helmet) during her trip to Kenya. Critics noted the helmet's frequent associations with European colonialism.","Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],16.12,C3541994|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],48.95,C3541994|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.35,C2350229|World War I,[acty],19.45,C1449759|Weather,[npop],16.04,C0043085|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],17.80,C3541994|Feathers,[bpoc],6.62,C0015731|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],16.04,C3541994|Light,[npop],16.03,C0023693|Sunlight,[npop],79.58,C0038817|Hot Temperature,[npop],45.08,C2350229|Plastics,[sbst],32.28,C0032167|Muscle Rigidity,[sosy],20.95,C0026837|World War II,[evnt],20.95,C0681710|Rain,[npop],19.28,C0034640|Vision,[orgf],16.59,C0042789|Labor (Childbirth),[orgf],16.30,C0022864|Weather,[npop],16.18,C0043085|Climate,[npop],16.16,C0008946|Light,[npop],16.12,C0023693|Identification (Psychology),[menp],13.01,C0020792|Foot,[bpoc],12.90,C0016504|Genetic Carriers,[fndg],9.73,C0007294|Crista ampullaris,[bpoc],3.47,C0229465|Feathers,[bpoc],6.58,C0015731|World War II,[evnt],39.00,C0681710|Sunlight,[npop],19.23,C0038817|Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome,[dsyn],16.04,C3541994|Cerebellar Ataxia, Mental Retardation, And Dysequilibrium Syndrome 1,[dsyn],13.00,C4551552|Creativity,[menp],12.92,C0010297|Plastics,[sbst],16.18,C0032167|Foot,[bpoc],12.89,C0016504|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.51,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.35,C2350229|Vision,[orgf],16.26,C0042789|Weather,[npop],16.04,C0043085|Psychological adjustment,[inbe],6.72,C0683269|Individual Adjustment,[inbe],3.57,C0376209|Sunlight,[npop],19.33,C0038817|Environmental air flow,[phpr],12.96,C0042491|Retinal Cone,[cell],22.41,C0206428|Stereotyped Behavior,[fndg],9.81,C0038271|Stereotypic Movement Disorder,[mobd],9.81,C0038273|Limb structure,[bpoc],6.53,C0015385|Mental association,[menp],13.01,C0004083|"

"('stem of taiwan erycibe', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('stem of taiwan erycibe', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, The amount of ginsenosides in Chinese ginseng depends on how the plant was cultivated and the age of the root. Wild Chinese ginseng, believed to be of highest TCM quality, has become rare in its natural habitat, so natural fostering efforts are utilized to emulate the wild variety.  Chinese ginseng can be white or red, depending on how it is processed.  White Chinese ginseng is unprocessed and dried naturally. Red Chinese ginseng is processed with steam and, in TCM, is believed to be more potent.

 Chinese herbology is a pseudoscientific practice with potentially unreliable product quality, safety hazards or misleading health advice. There are regulatory bodies, such as China GMP (Good Manufacturing Process) of herbal products. However, there have been notable cases of an absence of quality control during herbal product preparation. There is a lack of high-quality scientific research on herbology practices and product effectiveness for anti-disease activity. In the herbal sources listed below, there is little or no evidence for efficacy or proof of safety across consumer age groups and disease conditions for which they are intended.There are over 300 herbs in common use. Some of the most commonly used herbs are Ginseng (  ;   ; r nsh n), wolfberry (   ; g uq z ), dong quai (Angelica sinensis,   ;   ; d nggu ), astragalus (  ;   ; hu ngq ), atractylodes (  ;   ; b izh ), bupleurum (  ; ch ih ), cinnamon (cinnamon twigs (  ; gu zh ) and cinnamon bark (  ; r ugu )), coptis (  ;   ; hu ngli n), ginger ( ;  ; ji ng), hoelen (  ; f l ng), licorice (  ; g nc o), ephedra sinica (  ;   ; m hu ng), peony (white:   ; b ish o and reddish:   ; ch sh o), rehmannia (  ;   ; d hu ng), rhubarb (  ;   ; d hu ng), and salvia (  ;   ; d nsh n).Rhubarb (  ), used medicinally for its root, was one of the first herbs to be exported from China.

"('cluster mallow fruit', 'Uses')","In 1931, Maud Grieve wrote that the ""use of this species of Mallow has been much superseded by marsh-mallow (Althaea officinalis), which possesses its properties in a superior degree, but it is still a favorite remedy with country people where marsh-mallow is not obtainable."" The flowers were spread on doorways and woven into garlands or chaplets for celebrating May Day. The boiled young leaves are a vegetable eaten in several parts of Europe in the 19th century.In Morocco, Tunisia and Palestine, Malva leaves are steamed with garlic and tomatoes, and eaten as an appetizer or salad. In Egypt, the leaves are made into a stew-like vegetable dish, specially in winter, known as khobeiza, which is similar to Molokheia.In traditional medicine, M. sylvestris has been used in herbalism. Mucilage is present in many of the family Malvaceae including M. sylvestris, especially the fruit. The seeds are used internally in a decoction or herbal tea as a demulcent, and the leaves may be used in poultices as an emollient for external applications.The species has long been used as a natural yellow dye, but dyes of various yellow-green colors can be obtained from the plant and its seeds.  A tincture of the flowers can make a sensitive test for alkalis.","Eating,[orgf],26.13,C0013470|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.30,C0020498|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.59,C0020517|furuncle,[dsyn],3.45,C0242301|"
"('round cardamon fruit', 'Uses')","Both forms of cardamom are used as flavourings and cooking spices in both food and drink, and as a medicine. E. cardamomum (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a masticatory, and in medicine; it is also smoked.Cardamom has a strong, unique taste, with an intensely aromatic, resinous fragrance. Black cardamom has a distinctly more smoky, though not bitter, aroma, with a coolness some consider similar to mint.
Green cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to impart flavour. It is best stored in the pod, as  exposed or ground seeds quickly lose their flavour. Grinding the pods and seeds together lowers both the quality and the price. For recipes requiring whole cardamom pods, a generally accepted equivalent is 10 pods equals  1 1 2 teaspoons of ground cardamom.
It is a common ingredient in Indian cooking. It is also often used in baking in the Nordic countries, in particular in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, where it is used in traditional treats such as the Scandinavian Jule bread Julekake, the Swedish kardemummabullar sweet bun, and Finnish sweet bread pulla. In the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes, as well as traditional flavouring in coffee and tea. Cardamom is used to a wide extent in savoury dishes. In some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar, a mihbaj, and cooked together in a skillet, a mehmas, over wood or gas, to produce mixtures as much as 40% cardamom.
In Asia, both types of cardamom are widely used in both sweet and savory dishes, particularly in the south. Both are frequent components in spice mixes, such as Indian and Nepali masalas and Thai curry pastes. Green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in masala chai (spiced tea). Both are also often used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. Individual seeds are sometimes chewed and used in much the same way as chewing gum. It is used by confectionery giant Wrigley; its Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint packaging indicates the product contains ""cardamom to neutralize the toughest breath odors"". It is also included in aromatic bitters, gin, and herbal teas.
In Korea, medicinal cardamom (Amomum villosum var. xanthioides) and black cardamom (Amomum tsao-ko) are used in traditional tea called jeho-tang. 
 Both forms of cardamom are used as flavourings and cooking spices in both food and drink, and as a medicine. E. cardamomum (green cardamom) is used as a spice, a masticatory, and in medicine; it is also smoked.The content of essential oil in the seeds is strongly dependent on storage conditions, but may be as high as 8%. In the oil were found  -terpineol 45%, myrcene 27%, limonene 8%, menthone 6%,  -phellandrene 3%, 1,8-cineol 2%, sabinene 2% and heptane 2%. Other sources report 1,8-cineol (20 to 50%),  -terpenylacetate (30%), sabinene, limonene (2 to 14%), and borneol.In the seeds of round cardamom from Java (A. kepulaga), the content of essential oil is lower (2 to 4%), and the oil contains mainly 1,8-cineol (up to 70%) plus  -pinene (16%); furthermore,  -pinene,  -terpineol and humulene were found.","flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.09,C0039336|Smoking,[inbe],9.86,C0037369|Fragrance (odor),[npop],7.29,C2987717|flavor enhancers,[sbst],42.15,C0682897|Body Weight,[orga],24.11,C0005910|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.69,C0020498|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Wood material,[sbst],14.64,C0043217|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.91,C0020498|Chewing,[orgf],17.80,C0024888|Halitosis,[sosy],13.22,C0018520|Gigantism,[dsyn],13.02,C0017547|Paste substance,[sbst],3.63,C0030634|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.33,C0682897|Disease,[dsyn],9.72,C0012634|"
"('small centipeda herb', 'Cultivation and uses')","The aromatic leaves of some species are used for flavouring. Most species have an extremely bitter taste. A. dracunculus (tarragon) is widely used as a culinary herb, particularly important in French cuisine.
Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) was used to repel midges (mug > midge), fleas and moths, intestinal worms, and in brewing (mugwort beer, mugwort wine) as a remedy against hangovers and nightmares.
Artemisia absinthium is used to make the highly potent spirits absinthe. Mal rt also contains wormwood.  The aperitif vermouth (derived from the German word Wermut, ""wormwood"") is a wine flavored with aromatic herbs, but originally with wormwood.

Artemisia arborescens (tree wormwood, or sheeba in Arabic) is an aromatic herb indigenous to the Middle East used in tea, usually with mint.
A few species are grown as ornamental plants, the fine-textured ones used for clipped bordering. All grow best in free-draining sandy soil, unfertilized, and in full sun.
Artemisia stelleriana is known as Dusty Miller, but several other species bear that name, including Jacobaea maritima (syn. Senecio cineraria), Silene coronaria (syn. Lychnis coronaria), and Centaurea cineraria.
The largest collection of living Artemisia species, subspecies and cultivars is held in the National Collection of Artemisia in Sidmouth, Devon, UK , which holds about 400 taxa.

"('root of gansui', 'Principles, practices and beliefs')","Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout Hindu mother. The idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in Hindu Vaishnavism and Jain traditions in India, such as in his native Gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals. Gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in Hindu and Jain texts. Gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because ""there is essential unity of all life"".Gandhi believed that some life forms are more capable of suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain. He believed that slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi was not only a source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.Beyond his religious beliefs, Gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet. He attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ashram in Gujarat. He tried fresh and dry fruits (Fruitarianism), then just sun dried fruits, before resuming his prior vegetarian diet on advice of his doctor and concerns of his friends. His experiments with food began in the 1890s and continued for several decades. For some of these experiments, Gandhi combined his own ideas with those found on diet in Indian yoga texts. He believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or her diet because, in his studies at his ashram he saw ""one man's food may be poison for another"".Gandhi championed animal rights in general. Other than making vegetarian choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals (vivisection) in the name of science and medical studies. He considered it a violence against animals, something that inflicted pain and suffering. He wrote, ""Vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes that man is at present committing against God and His fair creation."" 
 Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi used fasting as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, after the end of British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.Alter states that Gandhi's fasting, vegetarianism and diet was more than a political leverage, it was a part of his experiments with self restraint and healthy living. He was ""profoundly skeptical of traditional Ayurveda"", encouraging it to study the scientific method and adopt its progressive learning approach. Gandhi believed yoga offered health benefits. He believed that a healthy nutritional diet based on regional foods and hygiene were essential to good health. Recently ICMR made Gandhi's health records public in a book 'Gandhi and Health@150'. These records indicate that despite being underweight at 46.7 kg Gandhi was generally healthy. He avoided modern medication and experimented extensively with water and earth healing. While his cardio records show his heart was normal, there were several instances he suffered from ailments like Malaria and was also operated on twice for piles and appendicitis. Despite health challenges Gandhi was able to walk about 79000 kms in his lifetime which comes to an average of 18 kms per day and is equivalent to walking around the earth twice. 
 Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi strongly favoured the emancipation of women, and urged ""the women to fight for their own self-development."" He opposed purdah, child marriage, dowry and sati. A wife is not a slave of the husband, stated Gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to Lyn Norvell. In his own life however, according to Suruchi Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values.At various occasions, Gandhi credited his orthodox Hindu mother, and his wife, for first lessons in satyagraha. He used the legends of Hindu goddess Sita to expound women's innate strength, autonomy and ""lioness in spirit"" whose moral compass can make any demon ""as helpless as a goat"". To Gandhi, the women of India were an important part of the ""swadeshi movement"" (Buy Indian), and his goal of decolonising the Indian economy.Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena state that even though Gandhi often and publicly expressed his belief in the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's rights were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects. 
 Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Along with many other texts, Gandhi studied Bhagavad Gita while in South Africa. This Hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence. Gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.Gandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food. He consulted the Jain scholar Rajchandra, whom he fondly called Raychandbhai. Rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion. Gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk. According to Sankar Ghose, Tagore described Gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.Gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his brahmacharya. The experiments began some time after the death of his wife in February 1944. At the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds. He later slept with women in the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women. In April 1945, Gandhi referenced being naked with several ""women or girls"" in a letter to Birla as part of the experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18 years old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their ""purity"", for which she readily accepted. Gandhi slept naked in the same bed with Manu with the bedroom doors open all night. Manu stated that the experiment had no ""ill effect"" on her. Gandhi also shared his bed with 18-year-old Abha, wife of his grandnephew Kanu. Gandhi would sleep with both Manu and Abha at the same time. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way. Those who went public said they felt as though they were sleeping with their ageing mother.According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly skeletal figure, already caricatured in the Western media. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times. 
 Gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him. Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life. Before 1932, he and his colleagues used the term Antyaja for untouchables. One of the major speeches he made on untouchability was at Nagpur in 1920, where he called untouchability as a great evil in Hindu society. In his remarks, he stated that the phenomena of untouchability is not unique to the Hindu society, but has deeper roots because Europeans in South Africa treat ""all of us, Hindus and Muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do"". He called it intolerable. He stated this practice can be eradicated, Hinduism is flexible to allow this, and a concerted effort is needed to persuade it is wrong and by all to eradicate it.According to Christophe Jaffrelot, while Gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class are based neither on inequality nor on inferiority. Gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whoever they want to, but no one should expect everyone to befriend them. Every individual regardless of his or her background, stated Gandhi, has a right to choose who they welcome into their home, who they befriend and who they spend time with.In 1932, Gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he started referring to as Harijans or ""the children of god"". On 8 May 1933, Gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a one-year campaign to help the Harijan movement. This new campaign was not universally embraced within the Dalit community. Ambedkar and his allies felt Gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining Dalit political rights. Ambedkar described him as ""devious and untrustworthy"". He accused Gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system. Ambedkar and Gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, where both tried to persuade each other.In 1935, Ambedkar announced his intentions to leave Hinduism and join Buddhism. According to Sankar Ghose, the announcement shook Gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, inter-marriage and what Hinduism says on the subject. These views contrasted with those of Ambedkar. In actual elections of 1937, except for some seats in Mumbai where Ambedkar's party won, India's untouchables voted heavily in favour of Gandhi's campaign and his party, the Congress.Gandhi and his colleagues continued to consult Ambedkar, keeping him influential. Ambedkar worked with other Congress leaders through the 1940s, wrote large parts of India's constitution in the late 1940s, and converted to Buddhism in 1956. According to Jaffrelot, Gandhi's views evolved between the 1920s and 1940s, when in 1946 he actively encouraged inter-marriage across castes. However, Gandhi's approach to untouchability was different from Ambedkar's, championing fusion, choice and free intermixing. Ambedkar envisioned each segment of society maintaining its identity group, and each group then separately advancing the ""politics of equality"".The criticism of Gandhi by Ambedkar continued to influence the Dalit movement past Gandhi's death. According to Arthur Herman, Ambedkar's hate for Gandhi and Gandhi's ideas was so strong that after he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination, remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then ""my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now"". According to Ramachandra Guha, ""ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of Gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in Ambedkar's name.""

Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi rejected the colonial Western format of education system. He stated that it led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy. Gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies. His methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.Gandhi called his ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He believed that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.Nai Talim evolved out of his experiences at the Tolstoy Farm in South Africa, and Gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the Sevagram ashram after 1937. Nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had scant place for Gandhi's village-oriented approach.In his autobiography, Gandhi wrote that he believed every Hindu boy and girl must learn Sanskrit because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.

Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi believed that swaraj not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. A military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.According to Gandhi, a non-violent state is like an ""ordered anarchy"". In a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated Gandhi. He emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges. On returning from South Africa, when Gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, ""in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties.""Swaraj to Gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era British power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into Indian hands. He warned such a transfer would still be English rule, just without the Englishman. ""This is not the Swaraj I want"", said Gandhi. Tewari states that Gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community. Democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression. For Gandhi, democracy was a way of life.

Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Some scholars state Gandhi supported a religiously diverse India, while others state that the Muslim leaders who championed the partition and creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan considered Gandhi to be Hindu nationalist or revivalist. For example, in his letters to Mohammad Iqbal, Jinnah accused Gandhi to be favouring a Hindu rule and revivalism, that Gandhi led Indian National Congress was a fascist party.In an interview with C.F. Andrews, Gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another. Gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised Indian religions then attempted to convert followers of Indian religions to Islam or Christianity. In Gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a Hindu, ""they must harbour in their breasts the belief that Hinduism is an error"" and that their own religion is ""the only true religion"". Gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions. He stated that spiritual studies must encourage ""a Hindu to become a better Hindu, a Mussalman to become a better Mussalman, and a Christian a better Christian.""According to Gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it is important to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.

Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhi believed in sarvodaya economic model, which literally means ""welfare, upliftment of all"". This, states Bhatt, was a very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free India by Nehru   India's first prime minister. To both, according to Bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but the Gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit the local situation, in contrast to Nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises.To Gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at ""greatest good for the greatest number"" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at the ""greatest good for all"". He believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the ""poor, less skilled, of impoverished background"" but also empowered to lift the ""rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords"". Violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong, believed Gandhi. He stated that the mandate theory of majoritarian democracy should not be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the ""resolutions of majorities"".Gandhi challenged Nehru and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialisation on the Soviet model; Gandhi denounced that as dehumanising and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived. After Gandhi's assassination, Nehru led India in accordance with his personal socialist convictions. Historian Kuruvilla Pandikattu says ""it was Nehru's vision, not Gandhi's, that was eventually preferred by the Indian State.""Gandhi called for ending poverty through improved agriculture and small-scale cottage rural industries. Gandhi's economic thinking disagreed with Marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist Bhikhu Parekh. Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as ""antagonistic class interests"". He argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself and that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation. Further, believed Gandhi, in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man.While disagreeing with Nehru about the socialist economic model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. He believed that a better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.

Some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.Gandhism designates the ideas and principles Gandhi promoted; of central importance is nonviolent resistance. A Gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, Gandhism. M. M. Sankhdher argues that Gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy. Rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view. It is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature. However Gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of ""Gandhism"", as he explained in 1936:

There is no such thing as ""Gandhism"", and I do not want to leave any sect after me. I do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine.

The rate of lichen extraction is high in the low sea area. The seedling stage is shade-loving and the transmittance is 10%. The growth of seedlings need to avoid the hot sun direct sun, the plant can withstand strong light. The growth of angelica should be cultivated in sandy loam with deep soil layer, loose soil, good drainage, and rich humus, not in low-lying water or easily hardened clay and barren sandy soil. 
 The dried root of A. sinensis is commonly known as Chinese angelica (Chinese:   ; pinyin: d nggu ; Pe h- e-j : tong-kui)  and is widely used in Chinese traditional medicine in the belief it benefits women's health, cardiovascular conditions, osteoarthrosis, inflammation, headache, infections, mild anemia, fatigue and high blood pressure. The dong quai (  ) means that a husband shall return to his wife, which is implicitly said to help women's sexual health.
Overall, the U.S. National Library of Medicine states that more evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of dong quai for most uses. 
 There is evidence that A. sinensis may affect the muscles of the uterus. Women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant should not use A. sinensis,  because it may induce a miscarriage. Taking A. sinensis can cause skin to become extra sensitive to the sun, leading to a greater risk for skin cancer. One case of gynaecomastia has been reported following consumption of dong quai root powder pills. Large and prolonged doses of the plant is not advised as it contains compounds that are considered carcinogenic. 
 A. sinensis may increase the anticoagulant effects of the drug warfarin (as it contains coumarins) and consequently increase the risk of bleeding.Due to the antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects of A. sinensis, it should be taken with caution with herbs or supplements (such as ginkgo, garlic, and ginger) that may slow blood clotting to reduce the possible risk of bleeding and bruising.","Cold Temperature,[npop],45.34,C0009264|Soil,[sbst],39.75,C0037592|Sunlight,[npop],38.68,C0038817|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.48,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.39,C2350229|Growth,[orgf],19.87,C0018270|Climate,[npop],16.30,C0008946|Light,[npop],16.30,C0023693|Humus,[sbst],13.14,C1258025|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.91,C0009443|Love,[menp],11.49,C0024028|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.76,C0041912|Sclerosis,[patf],9.74,C0036429|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.74,C0010352|Telling untruths,[inbe],3.56,C0600261|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.17,C0040452|Degenerative polyarthritis,[dsyn],14.64,C0029408|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0020538|Inflammation,[patf],11.49,C0021368|Sexual Health,[orga],10.06,C2362326|Anemia,[dsyn],9.99,C0002871|Infection,[patf],8.34,C3714514|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],4.12,C0007222|Gravidity,[fndg],35.81,C0600457|Miscarriage,[dsyn],20.95,C4552766|Spontaneous abortion,[patf],20.95,C0000786|Sunlight,[npop],19.20,C0038817|myometrium,[bpoc],16.18,C0027088|Carcinogenesis,[neop],13.28,C0596263|Gynecomastia,[dsyn],12.90,C0018418|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.71,C0020517|Malignant neoplasm of skin,[neop],5.18,C0007114|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Hemorrhage,[patf],19.60,C0019080|Blood coagulation,[ortf],13.22,C0005778|Contusions,[inpo],11.49,C0009938|"
"('spore of japanese climbing fern', 'Uses')","Ferns are not as important economically as seed plants, but have considerable importance in some societies. Some ferns are used for food, including the fiddleheads of Pteridium aquilinum (bracken), Matteuccia struthiopteris (ostrich fern), and Osmundastrum cinnamomeum (cinnamon fern). Diplazium esculentum is also used in the tropics (for example in budu pakis, a traditional dish of Brunei) as food. Tubers from the ""para"", Ptisana salicina (king fern) are a traditional food in New Zealand and the South Pacific. Fern tubers were used for food 30,000 years ago in Europe. Fern tubers were used by the Guanches to make gofio in the Canary Islands. Ferns are generally not known to be poisonous to humans. Licorice fern rhizomes were chewed by the natives of the Pacific Northwest for their flavor.Ferns of the genus Azolla, commonly known as water fern or mosquito ferns are very small, floating plants that do not resemble ferns. The mosquito ferns are used as a biological fertilizer in the rice paddies of southeast Asia, taking advantage of their ability to fix nitrogen from the air into compounds that can then be used by other plants.Azolla | Feedipedia
Ferns have proved resistant to phytophagous insects. The gene that express the protein Tma12 in an edible fern, Tectaria macrodonta, has been transferred to cotton plants, which became resistant to whitefly infestations.Many ferns are grown in horticulture as landscape plants, for cut foliage and as houseplants, especially the Boston fern (Nephrolepis exaltata) and other members of the genus Nephrolepis. The bird's nest fern (Asplenium nidus) is also popular, as are the staghorn ferns (genus Platycerium). Perennial (also known as hardy) ferns planted in gardens in the northern hemisphere also have a considerable following.Several ferns, such as bracken and Azolla species are noxious weeds or invasive species. Further examples include Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum),  sensitive fern (Onoclea sensibilis) and Giant  water fern (Salvinia molesta), one of the world's worst aquatic weeds. The important fossil fuel coal consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.Ferns have been studied and found to be useful in the removal of heavy metals, especially arsenic, from the soil. Other ferns with some economic significance include:
Dryopteris filix-mas (male fern), used as a vermifuge, and formerly in the US Pharmacopeia; also, this fern accidentally sprouting in a bottle resulted in Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward's 1829 invention of the terrarium or Wardian case
Rumohra adiantiformis (floral fern), extensively used in the florist trade
Microsorum pteropus (Java fern), one of the most popular freshwater aquarium plants.
Osmunda regalis (royal fern) and Osmunda cinnamomea (cinnamon fern), the root fiber being used horticulturally; the fiddleheads of O. cinnamomea are also used as a cooked vegetable
Matteuccia struthiopteris (ostrich fern), the fiddleheads used as a cooked vegetable in North America
Pteridium aquilinum or Pteridium esculentum (bracken), the fiddleheads used as a cooked vegetable in Japan and are believed to be responsible for the high rate of stomach cancer in Japan. It is also one of the world's most important agricultural weeds, especially in the British highlands, and often poisons cattle and horses.
Diplazium esculentum (vegetable fern), a source of food for some native societies
Pteris vittata (brake fern), used to absorb arsenic from the soil
Polypodium glycyrrhiza (licorice fern), roots chewed for their pleasant flavor

Systemic reactions: Primarily presenting anaphylaxis characterized by symptoms including hives (urticaria), lip and eyelid swelling (angioedema ) sneezing, nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, wheezing, cough, tightness of throat, hoarse voice, difficulty in breathing, abdominal pain, unconsciousness, shock with drop of blood pressure. In the systemic reactions can also be included severe reactions like dizziness, drowsiness, chills and collapse as has been reported in patients after ingestion of a falafel burger.
Other symptoms: Facial or generalized redness (""flushing""), hives (urticaria) on smaller or larger parts of the body, swelling of the eyelids,  lips or other parts of the face, itching of the eyes or of the skin in general, hay fever symptoms in the eyes and eczema. Respiratory symptoms observed include hay fever, asthma, cough, wheeze, or difficulty in breathing. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Itching in the mouth and/or tongue soon after chewing and ingesting (Oral allergy syndrome) and abdominal pain.Amounts as low as 100 mg of sesame seeds or flour and 3 ml of oil can trigger allergic reactions in severe cases of sesame-allergic individuals. Most patients, however, show allergic reactions after consuming 2 10 g of sesame seeds or flour. The onset of the symptoms may occur within a few minutes up to 90 minutes after ingestion of a sesame seed product. Most patients had other allergic diseases such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema, and most patients also had a relative with an allergic disease. More than two-thirds of the patients with sesame allergy also had allergic reactions to other foods.Prevalence of sesame allergy varies per country. While it is one of the three most common allergens in Israel, sesame allergy prevalence is considered small relative to other allergens in the United States. Some experts consider sesame allergies to have ""increased more than any other type of food allergy over the past 10 to 20 years"" in the United States. Such increasing prevalence led Canada to issue regulations that require food labels to note the presence of sesame.In addition to products derived from sesame such as tahini and sesame oil, persons with sesame allergies are warned to stay away from a broad assortment of processed foods, including baked goods, tempeh, and generic ""vegetable oil"".  In addition to possible food sources, individuals allergic to sesame have been warned that a variety of nonfood sources may also trigger a reaction to sesame, including adhesive bandages, cosmetics, hair-care products, perfumes, soaps and sunscreens, drugs, some fungicides and insecticides, lubricants, ointments and topical oils, and pet food.At least one study found that ""standard skin and blood testing for food allergies [does not] predict whether a child has true sesame allergy."" In which case, a food challenge under the direction of a physician may be required to properly diagnose a sesame allergy.
A cross-reactivity apparently exists between sesame allergens and peanut, rye, kiwifruit, poppy seed, and various tree nuts (such as hazelnut, black walnut, cashew, macadamia, and pistachio).","Allergic Reaction,[patf],52.00,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],52.00,C0020517|Affect (mental function),[menp],23.12,C0001721|Food Allergy,[patf],12.91,C0016470|Urticaria,[dsyn],29.46,C0042109|Unconscious State,[fndg],20.95,C0041657|Shock,[patf],20.15,C0036974|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Angioedema,[patf],17.80,C0002994|Hoarseness,[sosy],17.80,C0019825|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Eyelid structure,[bpoc],16.12,C0015426|Dizziness,[sosy],16.05,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],16.05,C0042571|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Wheezing,[sosy],14.64,C0043144|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],14.64,C0002792|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Pruritus,[fndg],13.09,C0033774|Nose,[bpoc],12.94,C0028429|Sneezing,[sosy],12.94,C0037383|Chills,[sosy],11.49,C0085593|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Edema,[sosy],9.99,C0013604|Hypotension,[fndg],9.78,C0020649|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],9.76,C0031354|Hypersensitivity,[patf],135.48,C0020517|Allergic Reaction,[patf],62.57,C1527304|Hay fever,[dsyn],59.76,C0018621|Food Allergy,[patf],39.53,C0016470|Precipitating Factors,[clna],35.81,C0032930|Asthma,[dsyn],32.61,C0004096|Eczema,[dsyn],29.46,C0013595|Urticaria,[dsyn],29.46,C0042109|Pruritus,[fndg],26.21,C0033774|Eye,[bpoc],26.05,C0015392|Sunscreening Agents,[sbst],20.95,C0038818|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Eyelid structure,[bpoc],16.18,C0015426|Chewing,[orgf],16.05,C0024888|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Flushing,[sosy],14.64,C0016382|Wheezing,[sosy],14.64,C0043144|Erythema,[dsyn],13.14,C0041834|Dyspnea,[sosy],13.14,C0013404|Syndrome,[dsyn],13.09,C0039082|Tongue,[bpoc],13.03,C0040408|Lubricants,[sbst],11.49,C0282222|Signs and Symptoms, Respiratory,[sosy],11.49,C0037090|Edema,[sosy],9.88,C0013604|Hair,[bpoc],6.63,C0018494|Body part,[bpoc],3.60,C0229962|Cross Reactions,[moft],11.49,C0010357|"
"('red ginseng', 'Uses')","Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.The root is most often available in dried form, either whole or sliced. Ginseng leaf, although not as highly prized, is sometimes also used.
In Korean cuisine, ginseng is used in various banchan (side dishes) and guk (soups), as well as tea and alcoholic beverages. Ginseng-infused tea and liquor, known as insamcha (literally ""ginseng tea"") and insamju (""ginseng liquor"") is consumed. 
 Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.Although ginseng is commonly sold as a dietary supplement, concerns have been raised about manufactured ginseng products containing toxic metals or filler materials, such as rice or wheat.In 2012, Chinese health regulators reclassified ginseng root as a dietary herb that can be used in health foods without prior approval, as long as no specific health claims are made for it; previously, it had been classified as an herbal drug whose inclusion in health foods required prior approval and licensing . Ginseng-infused teas and energy drinks are consumed today in China and neighboring countries as a kind of tonic for vitality, especially by men 50 and older, who might use them on a daily basis. Sliced bits of the dried root are also used in soups and other hot dishes. 
 Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.Although ginseng has been used in traditional medicine for centuries, modern research is inconclusive about its biological effects. Preliminary clinical research indicates possible effects on memory, fatigue, menopause symptoms, and insulin response in people with mild diabetes. Out of 44 studies examined between 2005 2015, 29 showed positive, limited evidence, and 15 showed no effects. As of 2017, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that ginseng has any health effects. However ginsenosides, unique phytochemicals of the Panax species, are being studied for their potential biological properties.Although the roots are used in traditional Chinese medicine, the leaves and stems contain larger quantities of the phytochemicals than the roots, and are easier to harvest. The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, but the effects of these ginseng compounds have not been studied with high-quality clinical research as of 2019, and therefore remain unknown. 
 Ginseng may be included in energy drinks or herbal teas in small amounts or sold as a dietary supplement.As of 2019, the United States FDA and Federal Trade Commission have issued numerous warning letters to manufacturers of ginseng dietary supplements for making false claims of health or anti-disease benefits, stating that the ""products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the referenced uses"" and are illegal as unauthorized ""new drugs"" under federal law.","Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Amniotic Fluid,[bdsu],20.39,C0002638|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.25,C0020498|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],32.39,C0040452|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.43,C2350229|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.25,C0020498|2alpha,3beta,19alpha-trihydroxyurs-12-en,[fndg],13.09,C0424320|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],11.49,C0274869|Inclusion Bodies,[celc],9.87,C0007637|Diabetes Mellitus,[dsyn],13.14,C0011849|Memory,[menp],12.90,C0025260|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Disease,[dsyn],9.78,C0012634|"
"('red ginseng', 'Safety and side effects')","Ginseng generally has a good safety profile and the incidence of adverse effects are minor when used over the short term. Concerns exist when ginseng is used chronically, potentially causing side effects such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems.The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescription medications is believed to be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with the blood thinner warfarin. Ginseng also has adverse drug reactions with phenelzine, and a potential interaction has been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with lamotrigine. Other side effects may include feeling anxious, insomnia, fluctuations in blood pressure, breast pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea, or diarrhea. If taken with other herbal supplements, ginseng may interact with them or with prescribed medicines or foods.The common ginsengs (P. ginseng and P. quinquefolia) are generally considered to be relatively safe even in large amounts. One of the most common and characteristic symptoms of an acute overdose of P. ginseng is bleeding. Symptoms of mild overdose may include dry mouth and lips, excitation, fidgeting, irritability, tremor, palpitations, blurred vision, headache, insomnia, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, edema, decreased appetite,  dizziness, itching, eczema, early morning diarrhea, bleeding, and fatigue.Symptoms of severe overdose with P. ginseng may include nausea, vomiting, irritability, restlessness, urinary and bowel incontinence, fever, increased blood pressure, increased respiration, decreased sensitivity and reaction to light, decreased heart rate, cyanotic (blue) facial complexion, red facial complexion, seizures, convulsions, and delirium.","Sleeplessness,[sosy],50.38,C0917801|Drug Overdose,[inpo],48.91,C0029944|Headache,[sosy],32.62,C0018681|Fever,[sosy],29.46,C0015967|Irritable Mood,[fndg],29.46,C0022107|Nausea,[sosy],29.46,C0027497|Seizures,[sosy],29.46,C0036572|Diarrhea,[sosy],26.64,C0011991|Hemorrhage,[patf],23.12,C0019080|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],23.12,C0020538|Delirium,[mobd],20.95,C0011206|Hypesthesia,[fndg],20.95,C0020580|Psychomotor Agitation,[fndg],20.95,C3887612|Term Birth,[orgf],19.33,C0233324|Dizziness,[sosy],17.80,C0012833|Fecal Incontinence,[dsyn],17.80,C0015732|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Mastodynia,[sosy],17.80,C0024902|Tremor,[sosy],17.80,C0040822|Vertigo,[sosy],17.80,C0042571|Desire for food,[orgf],16.30,C0003618|Vision,[orgf],16.30,C0042789|Blood Pressure,[orgf],16.10,C0005823|Systemic arterial pressure,[fndg],16.10,C1272641|Light,[npop],16.07,C0023693|Bradycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0428977|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Eczema,[dsyn],14.64,C0013595|Pruritus,[fndg],14.64,C0033774|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Xerostomia,[fndg],14.64,C0043352|Digestion,[orgf],12.96,C0012238|Edema,[sosy],11.49,C0013604|Fatigue,[sosy],11.49,C0015672|Cyanosis,[sosy],10.13,C0010520|Anxiety,[mobd],9.81,C0003467|Feelings,[menp],8.34,C1527305|Urinary tract,[bpoc],8.34,C0042027|Adverse reaction to drug,[patf],6.84,C0041755|Cell Respiration,[celf],6.83,C0282636|Vaginal Hemorrhage,[dsyn],5.18,C2979982|"
"('pummelo peel', 'Description and uses')","Typically, the fruit is pale green to yellow when ripe, with sweet white (or, more rarely, pink or red) flesh, and a very thick albedo (rind pith). It is a large citrus fruit, 15 25 centimetres (5.9 9.8 in) in diameter, usually weighing 1 2 kilograms (2.2 4.4 lb). Leaf petioles are distinctly winged.
The typical pomelo is much larger than the grapefruit and has a much thicker rind. It tastes like a sweet, mild grapefruit (believed to be a hybrid of Citrus maxima and the orange). The flesh has none, or very little, of the common grapefruit's bitterness. The enveloping membranous material around the segments is bitter, considered inedible, and usually discarded.
Sometimes, the peel is used to make marmalade. It may be candied or dipped in chocolate. In Brazil the thick skin is often used for making a sweet conserve, while the spongy pith of the rind is discarded. In Sri Lanka it is often eaten as a dessert, either raw or sprinkled with sugar. Some fatty Asian dishes use sliced pre-soaked pith to absorb the sauce and fat for eating.
In large parts of Southeast Asia, where Citrus maxima is native, it is a common dessert, often eaten raw and sprinkled with, or dipped in, a salt mixture. It is eaten in salads and drinks as well.
Citrus maxima is usually grafted onto other citrus rootstocks but may be grown from seed.
The fruit is said to have been introduced to Japan by a Cantonese captain in the An'ei era (1772 1781). There are two varieties: a sweet kind with white flesh, and a sour kind with pinkish flesh, the latter more likely to be used as an altar decoration than eaten. Pomelos often are eaten in Asia during the mid-autumn festival or mooncake festival.
It is one of the ingredients of Forbidden Fruit, a liqueur dating back to the early twentieth century that also contains honey and brandy. This liqueur is most famously used in the Dorchester cocktail.A wide variability has been observed in the physical and chemical characteristics of the fruits of various pomelo accessions from Bengal, India.","Pallor,[fndg],12.90,C0030232|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.03,C0039336|Tissue membrane,[tisu],6.58,C0025255|Eating,[orgf],26.06,C0013470|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.21,C0020498|Eating,[orgf],26.08,C0013470|Transplanted tissue,[tisu],6.68,C0332835|Eating,[orgf],26.44,C0013470|Festivals,[acty],20.04,C0015922|Physical Examination,[hlca],9.88,C0031809|"

"('phellodendron bark', 'Cultivation and uses')","As an ornamental plant, Phellodendron is a tree for all seasons. In spring it has yellow flowers, in summer it provides foliage and shade, in fall the leaves turn bright yellow, and the textured bark and winding branches add interest in the winter. The female bears black drupes that attract birds and other wildlife through the late fall and winter.
The cork-tree is resistant to drought and insects, and it can thrive in a variety of soils. It is hardy to zone 4 and it is easy to maintain, sometimes to the point of being invasive. One drawback is that the drupes fall and scatter, which may be undesirable on a formal lawn.
The bark in some species is thick, resembling that of the cork oak, but is not thick enough for commercial cork production. It has been used to produce a yellow dye.

One species, Phellodendron amurense (Chinese:   ; pinyin: hu ng b i; or   ; pinyin: hu ng b ; Russian:                 ""Barkhat Amurskiy"", also                 ,                 ), is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. Recently, Phellodendron has also attracted scientific attention  because of the phytochemicals it produces:

Berberine has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties
Jatrorrhizine may be anti-mutagenic
Phellodendrine has promise as an immune suppressant
Palmatine may be a vasodilatorThe phytochemical descriptions are included for informational purposes only and not for treatment purposes. The research at this stage is very preliminary. Traditionally, the bark is the principal part of the plant used medicinally, although oil from the fruit is also used. The species grows in Northern China, and in the Khabarovsk and Primorskiy regions of Russia.
Already identified as a significant forest invader in the mid-Atlantic region, Phellodendron amurense is an emerging species of concern in New England, and is identified as invasive or having invasive tendencies by state and private conservation authorities. Because the fruit is plentiful and high in sugars, Amur cork-tree attracts birds and mammals which help disperse its seeds. Because of its phytochemical profile and because the seedlings grow thickly, Phellodendron can out-compete other species. By suppressing reproduction of native hardwoods, Amur cork-tree can come to dominate native forests under favorable conditions. As a relatively new species of concern, its invasion biology and response to control are not well understood.","Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.53,C0007776|Natural Springs,[npop],13.25,C3179043|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],13.07,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],13.07,C0022655|Flatulence,[sosy],12.96,C0016204|Females,[orga],11.49,C0086287|Droughts,[npop],16.07,C0013140|Soil,[sbst],13.01,C0037592|Maintenance,[acty],8.34,C0024501|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.43,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.97,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.97,C0022655|Attention,[menp],13.01,C0004268|Mutagenesis Process,[moft],6.74,C0079866|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.80,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],13.34,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],13.34,C0022655|Forests,[npop],32.53,C0086312|Comprehension,[menp],13.09,C0162340|Reproduction,[orgf],9.86,C0035150|Disease,[dsyn],9.72,C0012634|"
"('canton love-pea vine', 'Uses')","Kudzu has been used as a form of erosion control and to enhance the soil. As a legume, it increases the nitrogen in the soil by a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its deep taproots also transfer valuable minerals from the subsoil to the topsoil, thereby improving the topsoil. In the deforested section of the central Amazon Basin in Brazil, it has been used for improving the soil pore-space in clay latosols, thus freeing even more water for plants than in the soil prior to deforestation. 
 Kudzu can be used by grazing animals, as it is high in quality as a forage and palatable to livestock.  It can be grazed until frost and even slightly after.  Kudzu had been used in the southern United States specifically to feed goats on land that had limited resources.  Kudzu hay typically has a 15 18% crude protein content and over 60% total digestible nutrient value.  The quality of the leaves decreases, however, as vine content increases relative to the leaf content.  Kudzu also has low forage yields despite its rate of growth, yielding around two to four tons of dry matter per acre annually.  It is also difficult to bale due to its vining growth and its slowness in shedding water.  This makes it necessary to place kudzu hay under sheltered protection after being baled.  Fresh kudzu is readily consumed by all types of grazing animals, but frequent grazing over three to four years can ruin even established stands.  Thus, kudzu only serves well as a grazing crop on a temporary basis. 
 Kudzu fiber has long been used for fiber art and basketry.  The long runners which propagate the kudzu fields and the larger vines which cover trees make excellent weaving material.  Some basketmakers use the material green.  Others use it after splitting it in half, allowing it to dry and then rehydrating it using hot water.  Both traditional and contemporary basketry artists use kudzu. 
 Kudzu contains isoflavones, including puerarin (about 60% of the total isoflavones), daidzein, daidzin (structurally related to genistein), mirificin, and salvianolic acid, among numerous others identified. In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as g  g n (gegen), kudzu is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs thought to have therapeutic effects, although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it has any activity or therapeutic use in humans. Adverse effects may occur if kudzu is taken by people with hormone-sensitive cancer or those taking tamoxifen, antidiabetic medications, or methotrexate. 
 The roots contain starch, which has traditionally been used as a food ingredient in East Asia. In Vietnam, the starch called b t s n d y is flavoured with pomelo oil and then used as a drink in the summer. In Japan, the plant is known as kuzu and the starch named kuzuko. Kuzuko is used in dishes including kuzumochi, mizu manj , and kuzuyu. It also serves as a thickener for sauces, and can substitute for cornstarch.The flowers are used to make a jelly that tastes similar to grape jelly. Roots, flowers, and leaves of kudzu show antioxidant activity that suggests food uses. Nearby bee colonies may forage on kudzu nectar during droughts as a last resort, producing a low-viscosity red or purple honey that tastes of grape jelly or bubblegum. 
 Kudzu has also been used for centuries in East Asia to make herbal teas and tinctures. Kudzu powder is used in Japan to make an herbal tea called kuzuyu.  Kakkonto (   , Mandarin Chinese: g g nt ng, Japanese: kakkont ; literally, Kudzu Root Soup) is a herbal drink with its origin in traditional Chinese medicine. It is made from a mixture containing the main ingredient, dried kudzu roots, and sliced fresh ginger, cinnamon twigs, Chinese peony, licorice, jujubes, and ephedra. Together these plants are used to create a drink containing puerarin, daidzein, paenoflorin, cinnamic acid, glycyrrhizin, ephedrine and gingerol. 
 Kudzu fiber, known as ko-hemp, is used traditionally to make clothing and paper, and has also been investigated for industrial-scale use.It may become a valuable asset for the production of cellulosic ethanol. In the Southern United States, kudzu is used to make soaps, lotions, and compost.","Soil,[sbst],53.58,C0037592|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.48,C0599638|Forms Control,[hlca],19.30,C0016589|Psychological Transfer,[menp],14.64,C0040671|Symbiosis,[npop],9.69,C0039029|Animal Grazing,[orgf],32.58,C3178952|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Growth,[orgf],19.78,C0018270|Desiccation,[npop],9.74,C0011682|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.71,C0010352|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.61,C2350229|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Thinking, function,[menp],11.49,C0039869|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.63,C0020517|Therapeutic Effect,[clna],5.18,C1527144|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.63,C0006826|Taste Perception,[ortf],26.50,C0039336|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.17,C0020498|Droughts,[npop],16.17,C0013140|Viscosity,[npop],6.63,C0042784|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.09,C0040452|Compost,[sbst],27.26,C1258026|"

 Celosia argentea var. argentea or Lagos spinach (a.k.a. quail grass, soko, celosia, feather cockscomb) is a broadleaf annual leaf vegetable.  It grows widespread across Mexico, where it is known as ""velvet flower"", northern South America, tropical Africa, the West Indies, South, East and Southeast Asia where it is grown as a native or naturalized wildflower, and is cultivated as a nutritious leafy green vegetable.  It is traditional fare in the countries of Central and West Africa, and is one of the leading leafy green vegetables in Nigeria, where it is known as  soko yokoto , meaning ""make husbands fat and happy"". In Spain it is known as ""Rooster comb"" because of its appearance.

"('asiatic pennywort herb', 'Culinary use')","In Myanmar cuisine  raw pennywort is used as the main constituent in a salad mixed  with onions, crushed peanuts, bean powder and seasoned with lime juice and fish sauce. Centella is used as a leafy green in Sri Lankan cuisine, being the predominantly locally available leafy green, where it is called gotu kola. The adjective gotu in Sinhalese, is translated as ""an inverted conical shape"" (like the shape of a colander) and kola as ""leaf"". It is most often prepared as malluma, a traditional accompaniment to rice and curry, and goes especially well with vegetarian dishes, such as dal, and jackfruit or pumpkin curry. It is considered nutritious. In addition to finely chopped gotu kola plants, the gotu kola malluma may can be eaten  with grated coconut, diced shallots, lime (or lemon) juice, and sea salt. Additional ingredients are finely chopped green chilis, chili powder, turmeric powder, or chopped carrots. The centella fruit-bearing structures are discarded from the gotu kola malluma due to their intense bitter taste. A variation of porridge known as kola kenda is also made with gotu kola by the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka. Gotu kola kenda is made with well-boiled red rice with some extra liquid, coconut milk  first extract, and gotu kola pur e. The porridge is accompanied with jaggery for sweetness. Centella leaves are also used in modern sweet ""pennywort"" drinks and herbal teas. In addition the leaves are served stir-fried whole in coconut oil, or cooked in coconut milk with garlic or dhal.
In Indonesia, the leaves are used for sambai oi peuga-ga, an Aceh type of salad, and is also mixed into asinan in Bogor. In Vietnam and Thailand, this leaf is used for preparing a drink or can be eaten in raw form in salads or cold rolls. In Bangkok, vendors in the famous Chatuchak Weekend Market sell it alongside coconut, roselle, chrysanthemum, orange and other health drinks. In Malay cuisine it is known as pegaga, and the leaves of this plant are used for ulam, a type of Malay salad. Centella is widely used in various Indian regional cuisines. Among the Kukis of Northeast India, it is locally known as 'Changkong che' and is widely used as chutney along with dried red chili and fermented fish called 'nga-thu' or 'ngari'.","Milk (body substance),[bdsu],32.45,C0026131|Retinal Cone,[cell],22.34,C0206428|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.14,C0020498|Taste Perception,[ortf],13.09,C0039336|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.72,C0162425|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.66,C0332679|furuncle,[dsyn],3.52,C0242301|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.43,C0009264|Osteogenesis Imperfecta,[cgab,dsyn],16.17,C0029434|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Common Cold,[dsyn],12.96,C0009443|Opportunistic Infections,[dsyn],9.86,C0029118|Upper Respiratory Infections,[dsyn],9.81,C0041912|"

"('odoriferous rosewood', 'Health and environmental issues')","Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.Evidence in peer-reviewed journals shows that some fragrances can cause asthmatic reactions in some individuals, especially those with severe or atopic asthma. Many fragrance ingredients can also cause headaches, allergic skin reactions or nausea.In some cases, an excessive use of perfumes may cause allergic reactions of the skin. For instance, acetophenone, ethyl acetate and acetone while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory allergens. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, causes skin irritation when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the furanocoumarin present in natural extracts of grapefruit or celery can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.Some research on natural aromatics have shown that many contain compounds that cause skin irritation. However some studies, such as IFRA's research claim that opoponax is too dangerous to be used in perfumery, still lack scientific consensus.
It is also true that sometimes inhalation alone can cause skin irritation.

A number of national and international surveys have identified balsam of Peru, often used in perfumes, as being in the ""top five"" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics.  A study in 2001 found that 3.8% of the general population patch tested was allergic to it.  Many perfumes contain components identical to balsam of Peru.Balsam of Peru is used as a marker for perfume allergy. Its presence in a cosmetic is denoted by the INCI term Myroxylon pereirae. Balsam of Peru has been banned by the International Fragrance Association since 1982 from use as a fragrance compound, but may be present as an extract or distillate in other products, where mandatory labelling is not required for usage of 0.4% or less. 
 Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.There is scientific evidence that nitro-musks such as musk xylene could cause cancer in some specific animal tests. These reports were evaluated by the EU Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS, formerly the SCCNFP ) and musk xylene was found to be safe for continued use in cosmetic products. It is in fact part of the procedures of the Cosmetic Regulation in Europe that materials classified as carcinogens require such a safety evaluation by the authorities to be allowed in cosmetic consumer products.
Although other ingredients such as polycyclic synthetic musks, have been reported to be positive in some in-vitro hormone assays, these reports have been reviewed by various authorities. For example, for one of the main polycyclic musks Galaxolide (HHCB) these reviews include those of the EU Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, the EU's Priority Substances Review, the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk, and more recently also the US EPA. The outcome of all of these reviews over the past decade or so is that there are no safety concerns for human health. Reviews with similar positive outcomes also exist for another main polycyclic musk (AHTN) for instance, on its safe use in cosmetics by the EU.Many natural aromatics, such as oakmoss absolutes, basil oil, rose oil and many others contain allergens or carcinogenic compounds, the safety of which is either governed by regulations (e.g. allowed methyl eugenol levels in the EU Cosmetics Regulation (Entry 102, Annex III of the EU Cosmetics Regulation.) or through various limitations set by the International Fragrance Association. 
 Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.Certain chemicals found in perfume are often toxic, at least for small insects if not for humans. For example, the compound Tricyclodecenyl allyl ether is often found in synthetic perfumes and has insect repellent property. 
 Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.Synthetic musks are pleasant in smell and relatively inexpensive, as such they are often employed in large quantities to cover the unpleasant scent of laundry detergents and many personal cleaning products. Due to their large-scale use, several types of synthetic musks have been found in human fat and milk, as well as in the sediments and waters of the Great Lakes.These pollutants may pose additional health and environmental problems when they enter human and animal diets. 
 Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.The demands for aromatic materials such as sandalwood, agarwood, and musk have led to the endangerment of these species, as well as illegal trafficking and harvesting. 
 Perfume ingredients, regardless of natural or synthetic origins, may all cause health or environmental problems when used. Although the areas are under active research, much remains to be learned about the effects of fragrance on human health and the environment.The perfume industry in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested to the extent that they are Generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced. The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and foug re classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.","Asthma,[dsyn],32.48,C0004096|Allergic Reaction,[patf],20.89,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],20.89,C0020517|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Peer Review,[hlca],12.91,C0030768|Fragrance (odor),[npop],11.03,C2987717|Disease,[dsyn],9.73,C0012634|Mental concentration,[menp],7.04,C0086045|Radiation Tolerance,[orga],6.75,C0034537|Inspiration function,[orgf],16.30,C0004048|Term Birth,[orgf],19.32,C0233324|Mental association,[menp],13.01,C0004083|Fragrance (odor),[npop],7.00,C2987717|Allergic Reaction,[patf],6.83,C1527304|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.83,C0020517|Biological Markers,[clna],6.72,C0005516|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.55,C2987717|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.55,C0006826|Mental association,[menp],13.01,C0004083|Set (Psychology),[menp],13.01,C0036849|Carcinogenesis,[neop],12.91,C0596263|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.55,C2987717|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.55,C2987717|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],17.80,C0026131|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Smell Perception,[orgf],12.91,C0037361|Fragrance (odor),[npop],7.14,C2987717|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.55,C2987717|Hydranencephaly with Renal Aplasia-Dysplasia,[dsyn],13.02,C1856053|Learning,[menp],13.01,C0023185|Set (Psychology),[menp],12.88,C0036849|Fragrance (odor),[npop],6.99,C2987717|"

"('tinosporae radix', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('tinosporae radix', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

"('calyx seu fructus physalis', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('calyx seu fructus physalis', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, The amount of ginsenosides in Chinese ginseng depends on how the plant was cultivated and the age of the root. Wild Chinese ginseng, believed to be of highest TCM quality, has become rare in its natural habitat, so natural fostering efforts are utilized to emulate the wild variety.  Chinese ginseng can be white or red, depending on how it is processed.  White Chinese ginseng is unprocessed and dried naturally. Red Chinese ginseng is processed with steam and, in TCM, is believed to be more potent.

"('peking euphorbia root', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('peking euphorbia root', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

The constituents include steroid saponins known as ginsenosides, The amount of ginsenosides in Chinese ginseng depends on how the plant was cultivated and the age of the root. Wild Chinese ginseng, believed to be of highest TCM quality, has become rare in its natural habitat, so natural fostering efforts are utilized to emulate the wild variety.  Chinese ginseng can be white or red, depending on how it is processed.  White Chinese ginseng is unprocessed and dried naturally. Red Chinese ginseng is processed with steam and, in TCM, is believed to be more potent.

"('solanum nigrum linn.', 'Toxicity')","Solanine levels in S. nigrum can be toxic. Children have died from poisoning after eating unripe berries. However, the plant is rarely fatal, with ripe berries causing symptoms of mild abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea.Poisoning symptoms are typically delayed for 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms of toxicity include fever, sweating, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, and drowsiness. Death from ingesting large amounts of the plant results from cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure.  Livestock have also been poisoned from nitrate toxicity by grazing the leaves of S. nigrum. All kinds of animals can be poisoned after ingesting nightshade, including cattle, sheep, poultry, and swine. However, in central Spain, the great bustard (Otis tarda) may act as a seed disperser of European black nightshade (Solanum nigrum). Black nightshade is highly variable, and poisonous plant experts advise to avoid eating the berries unless they are a known edible strain. The toxin levels may also be affected by the plant's growing conditions. The toxins in S. nigrum are most concentrated in the unripe green berries, and immature fruit should be treated as toxic.  Most cases of suspected poisoning are due to consumption of leaves or unripe fruit.
There are ethnobotanical accounts of S. nigrum leaves and shoots being boiled as a vegetable with the cooking water being discarded and replaced several times to remove toxins.","Abdominal Pain,[sosy],32.86,C0000737|Diarrhea,[sosy],29.46,C0011991|Vomiting,[sosy],29.46,C0042963|Eating,[orgf],26.35,C0013470|Poisoning,[inpo],20.28,C0032343|Cessation of life,[orgf],19.86,C0011065|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Sweating,[fndg],17.80,C0038990|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Respiratory Failure,[dsyn],11.49,C1145670|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Cardiac Arrhythmia,[dsyn],9.95,C0003811|Affect (mental function),[menp],9.83,C0001721|Plant Diseases,[dsyn],6.72,C0032080|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.63,C0080194|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|furuncle,[dsyn],3.54,C0242301|"
"('solanum nigrum linn.', 'Uses')","Some of the uses ascribed to S. nigrum in literature may actually apply to other black nightshade species within the same species complex, and proper species identification is essential for food and medicinal uses (See Taxonomy section).S. nigrum has been widely used as a food since early times, and the fruit was recorded as a famine food in 15th-century China. Despite toxicity issues with some forms, the ripe berries and boiled leaves of edible strains are eaten. The thoroughly boiled leaves   although strong and slightly bitter flavoureds   are used like spinach as horta and in fataya pies and quiches. The ripe black berries are described as sweet and salty, with hints of liquorice and melon.In Kenya, among the Abagusii, S. nigrum (Rinagu- singular; Amanagu- plural) is a vegetable delicacy which when blanched and  sauteed or boiled to soften and then salted or sauteed and eaten with Ugali (a corn (maize) meal product). In the rest of Kenya, S. nigrum (Managu) is eaten in a similar way.
In Tanzania, S. nigrum (mnafu or mnamvu in Kiswahili) is a popular green vegetable. Saut ed with chicken or pork, eaten with Ugali, it is both delicious and expensive meal in most restaurants in urban areas. Traditionally, the Iraqw people in northern Tanzania have used S. nigrum ( manakw) as vegetable for generations, eaten with special  ugali  (xwante), stiff porridge made with corn, millet or sorghum  flour.
In India, the berries are casually grown and eaten, but not cultivated for commercial use. In South India, the leaves and berries are routinely consumed as food after cooking with tamarind, onion, and cumin seeds. The berries are referred to as ""fragrant tomato"". Although not very popular across much of its growing region, the fruit and dish are common in Tamil Nadu (            in Tamil), Kerala, southern Andhra Pradesh, and southern Karnataka.
In Ethiopia, the ripe berries are picked and eaten by children in normal times, while during famines, all affected people would eat berries. In addition, the leaves are collected by women and children, who cook the leaves in salty water and consume them like any other vegetable. Farmers in the Konso Special Woreda report that because S. nigrum matures before the maize is ready for harvesting, it is used as a food source until their crops are ready. The Welayta people in the nearby Wolayita Zone do not weed out S. nigrum that appears in their gardens since they likewise cook and eat the leaves.In Ghana, the unripe green berries are called kwaansusuaa or abedru, and are used in preparing various soups and stews, including the popular palm nut soup commonly eaten with banku or fufu'.

In South Africa, the very ripe and hand-selected fruit (nastergal in Afrikaans and umsobo in Zulu) is cooked into a beautiful but quite runny purple jam.In Greece and Turkey, the leaves are called istifno, and in Crete known as stifno. They are one of the ingredients included in the salad of boiled greens known as horta.In Indonesia, the young fruits and leaves of cultivated forms are used and are known as ranti (Javanese) or leunca (Sundanese). The fruit and leaves are eaten raw as part of a traditional salad lalapan, or the fruit is cooked (fried) with oncom.It was imported into Australia from Mauritius in the 1850s as a vegetable during the gold rush, but S. nigrum is now prohibited for trade as a food by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.During ancient times in Hawaii young shoots, leaves, small white flowers, and small black berries were eaten. The leaves, among other greens, were cooked by rolling hot stones among them in a covered gourd. 
 Some of the uses ascribed to S. nigrum in literature may actually apply to other black nightshade species within the same species complex, and proper species identification is essential for food and medicinal uses (See Taxonomy section).The plant has a long history of medicinal usage, dating back to ancient Greece. ""... In the fourteenth century, we hear of the plant under the name of Petty Morel being used for canker and with Horehound and wine taken for dropsy."" It was a traditional European medicine used as a strong sudorific, analgesic and sedative with powerful narcotic properties, but was considered a ""somewhat dangerous remedy"". Internal use has fallen out of favor in Western herbalism due to its variable chemistry and toxicity, but it is used topically as a treatment for herpes zoster.There is much disagreement as to whether the leaves and fruit of S. nigrum are poisonous. But many countries grow this plant as a food crop. Some scientists have pointed out that the toxicity of S. nigrum can be determined by the region and species where it grows. Also,There are many studies that have proved that solanum, an alkaloid contained in solanum, is very important for human health, but it depends on the concentration and conditions in which they are used. Early studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and is resistant to diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa.S. nigrum is an important ingredient in traditional Indian medicines. Infusions are used in dysentery, stomach complaints, and fever. The juice of the plant is used on ulcers and other skin diseases. The fruits are used as a tonic, laxative, appetite stimulant, and for treating asthma and ""excessive thirst"".  Traditionally the plant was used to treat tuberculosis.  It is known as peddakasha pandla koora in the Telangana region. This plant's leaves are used to treat mouth ulcers that happen during winter periods of Tamil Nadu, India. It is known as manathakkali keerai (                )in Tamil Nadu and kaage soppu in Karnataka, and apart from its use as a home remedy for mouth ulcers, is used in cooking like spinach. In North India, the boiled extracts of leaves and berries are also used to alleviate liver-related ailments, including jaundice. In Assam, the juice from its roots is used against asthma and whooping cough.S. nigrum is a widely used plant in oriental medicine where it is considered to be antitumorigenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, diuretic, and antipyretic.A Solanum species of the S. nigrum group from the Los Lagos Region of southern Chile with the common name hierba mora is used in local folk medicine as an antidote to the anticholinergic poisoning caused by the dangerous hallucinogenic plant Latua pubiflora. It is used by the shamans of the indigenous Huilliche people when they need to 'sober up' quickly from Latua intoxication.Some experiments indicate that the plant inhibits growth of cervical carcinoma in mice. The active ingredient of the plant, solanine, inhibits the proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro, such as breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.Its anti-tumor mechanism is mainly through the induction of different cell and molecular pathways, leading to apoptosis and autophagy of cells and molecules, and inhibiting tumor metastasis.Solanum nigrum is known to contain solasodine (a steroidal glycoalkaloid that can be used to make 16-DPA progenitor);  a possible commercial source could be via cultivating the hairy roots of this plant.It is also a treatment of gastric ulcer. Through experiments on mice gastric ulcer model and control group, the results showed that the extract of black nightshade powder and methanol could significantly affect the secretion of gastric acid and protease in mice, thus significantly reducing the gastric ulcer index of mice.","Eating,[orgf],39.87,C0013470|Unmarried,[fndg],22.51,C0087136|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Identification (Psychology),[menp],13.09,C0020792|Famine,[phpr],13.02,C0015619|furuncle,[dsyn],10.60,C0242301|Corn of toe,[acab],5.18,C0010046|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.43,C0080194|Eating,[orgf],26.17,C0013470|Corn of toe,[acab],3.59,C0010046|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],17.80,C0020498|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.51,C2987717|Eating,[orgf],54.29,C0013470|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.36,C0599638|Famine,[phpr],13.05,C0015619|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],11.49,C0024809|Avian crop,[bpoc],8.34,C0010352|Eating,[orgf],26.18,C0013470|Hot Temperature,[npop],22.48,C2350229|Hand,[bpoc],12.94,C0018563|Calculi,[bdsu],9.87,C0006736|furuncle,[dsyn],3.52,C0242301|Gastric ulcer,[dsyn],58.58,C0038358|Asthma,[dsyn],32.58,C0004096|Cardiac Arrest,[dsyn],30.29,C0018790|Tuberculosis,[dsyn],20.95,C0041296|Oral Ulcer,[dsyn],19.95,C0149745|Disease,[dsyn],19.75,C0012634|Herpes zoster disease,[dsyn],17.80,C0019360|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Cell Proliferation,[celf],16.18,C0596290|Pertussis,[dsyn],16.12,C0043167|Breast Carcinoma,[neop],14.64,C0678222|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Icterus,[sosy],14.64,C0022346|Pancreatic carcinoma,[neop],14.64,C0235974|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],13.22,C0027627|Identification (Psychology),[menp],13.09,C0020792|Autophagy,[celf],13.08,C0004391|Dysentery,[dsyn],13.05,C0013369|Stomach,[bpoc],12.96,C0038351|Gastric Acid,[bdsu],12.92,C0017119|Hirsutism,[fndg],12.85,C0019572|Hypertrichosis,[dsyn],12.85,C0020555|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Polydipsia,[sosy],11.49,C0085602|Gastric Juice (substance),[bdsu],9.90,C0017133|Apoptosis,[celf],9.90,C0162638|Edema,[sosy],9.90,C0013604|Ulcer,[patf],9.90,C0041582|Growth,[orgf],9.88,C0018270|Dermatologic disorders,[dsyn],8.34,C0037274|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Pathogenicity,[orga],6.66,C1136169|Liver,[bpoc],6.63,C0023884|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.58,C0010352|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Hair,[bpoc],6.54,C0018494|Malignant neoplasm of breast,[neop],5.18,C0006142|Malignant neoplasm of pancreas,[neop],5.18,C0346647|Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Cells,[cell],3.55,C0007634|Neoplasms,[neop],3.48,C0027651|cervical cancer,[neop],3.45,C4048328|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|furuncle,[dsyn],3.41,C0242301|"
"('fruit of beautiful sweetgum', 'Uses')","Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) is one of the most important commercial hardwoods in the Southeastern United States. Its wood is bright reddish brown (with the sapwood nearly white) and may have black grain in the heartwood; it is heavy, straight, satiny, and close-grained, but not strong. It takes a beautiful polish, but warps badly in drying.  The wood has a specific gravity of 0.5910. It is too liable to decay for outdoor use.
In the carpentry industry, the timber is referred to as satin walnut  and is one of the most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork.  It was formerly used in the interior finish of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames. The wood is also used to make chopsticks for the East Asian market, as it has a naturally light color with appeal to certain segments of the Asian market. 
 The tree's gum resin, for which the tree is named, exudes from the bark of the tree when wounded.  It has many names, including liquid amber or copalm balsam. It is a kind of native balsam, or resin, resembling turpentine. It may be clear, reddish, or yellow, with a pleasant smell like ambergris. As the resin ages, it solidifies, the form in which it was historically exported in barrels.  The resin is produced by stripping, boiling, and pressing the tree's bark.

Mung beans are light yellow in colour when their skins are removed. Mung bean paste can be made by dehulling, cooking, and pulverizing the beans to a dry paste.Although whole mung beans are also occasionally used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used; but in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans (called pachai payaru            in Tamil and cherupayar         in Malayalam) are commonly boiled to make a dry preparation often served with rice gruel (kanji      ). Dehulled mung beans can also be used in a similar fashion as whole beans for the purpose of making sweet soups.

 
Mung beans in some regional cuisines of India are stripped of their outer coats to make mung dal. In Bangladesh and West Bengal the stripped and split bean is used to make soup-like dal known as Moog dal(       ).

 
In the South Indian States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, and also in Maharashtra steamed whole beans are seasoned with spices and fresh grated coconut in a preparation called ""Pesalu""       in Telugu or Usli in Kannada or Sundal         in Tamil or ""Usal""      in Marathi.

In Hong Kong, dehulled mung beans and mung bean paste are made into ice cream or frozen ice pops. Mung bean paste is used as a common filling for Chinese mooncakes in East China and Taiwan. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the boiled and shelled beans are used as filling in glutinous rice dumplings prepared for consumption. The beans may also be cooked until soft, blended into a liquid, sweetened, and served as a beverage, popular in many parts of China.
In Korea, skinned mung beans are soaked and ground with some water to make a thick batter.  This is used as a basis for the Korean pancakes called Bindae-tteok ({  }   ).

Mung bean paste can be made by dehulling, cooking, and pulverizing the beans to a dry paste.A staple diet in some parts of the Middle East is mung beans and rice. Both are cooked together in a pilaf-like rice dish called maash wa ruzz, which means mung beans and rice. 
 Mung beans are commonly used in cuisines across Asia.Mung beans are germinated by leaving them in water for four hours of daytime light and spending the rest of the day in the dark. Mung bean sprouts can be grown under artificial light for four hours over the period of a week.  They are usually simply called ""bean sprouts"". However, when bean sprouts are called for in recipes, it generally refers to mung bean or soybean sprouts.

Mung bean sprouts are stir-fried as a Chinese vegetable accompaniment to a meal, usually with garlic, ginger, spring onions, or pieces of salted dried fish to add flavour. Uncooked bean sprouts are used in filling for Vietnamese spring rolls, as well as a garnish for ph . They are a major ingredient in a variety of Malaysian and Peranakan cuisine, including char kway teow, hokkien mee, mee rebus, and pasembor.
In Korea, slightly cooked mung bean sprouts, called sukjunamul (Korean:     ), are often served as a side dish. They are blanched (placed into boiling water for less than a minute), immediately cooled in cold water, and mixed with sesame oil, garlic, salt, and often other ingredients.  In the Philippines, mung bean sprouts are made into lumpia rolls called lumpiang togue.
In India, mung bean sprouts are cooked with green chili, garlic, and other spices in the state of Gujarat.
In Indonesia the food are often used as fillings like Tahu Isi (stuffed tofu) and complementary ingredient in many dishes such as rawon and soto.
In Japan (and Brazil), the sprouts are called moyashi. 
 Mung beans are commonly used in cuisines across Asia.Mung bean starch, which is extracted from ground mung beans, is used to make transparent cellophane noodles (also known as bean thread noodles, bean threads, glass noodles, fensi (  ), tung hoon (  ), mi n, b n t u, or b n t o). Cellophane noodles become soft and slippery when they are soaked in hot water. A variation of cellophane noodles, called mung bean sheets or green bean sheets, are also available.
In Korea, a jelly called nokdumuk (Korean:    ; also called cheongpomuk;    ) is made from mung bean starch; a similar jelly, colored yellow with the addition of gardenia coloring, is called hwangpomuk (   ).
In northern China, mung bean jelly is called liangfen (Chinese:   ; literally: 'chilled bean jelly'), which is a very popular food during summer. Jidou liangfen is another flavor of mung bean jelly food in Yunnan, in southern China.
Mung batter is used to make crepes named pesarattu in Andhra Pradesh, India and pancakes named Bindaetteok in Korea.

"('shrub chastetree fruit', 'Herbal uses')","The leaves and tender stem growth of the upper 10 cm (3.9 in), along with the flowers and ripening seeds, are harvested for alternative medicinal purposes. It is believed the berries are a tonic herb for both the male and female reproductive systems. The leaves are believed to have the same effect, but to a lesser degree. The leaves, flowers, and/or berries may be consumed as a decoction, traditional tincture, cider vinegar tincture, syrup, elixir, or simply eaten from the plant with presumed benefits as food. A popular way of taking Vitex is on awakening as a simple 1:1 fluid extract, which is said to interact with hormonal circadian rhythms most effectively.In ancient times, it was believed to be an anaphrodisiac, hence the name chaste tree. Pliny, in his Historia Naturalis, reported the use of stems and leaves of this plant by women as bedding ""to cool the heat of lust"" during the time of the Thesmophoria, when Athenian women left their husbands to remain ritually chaste. At the end of the 13th century, John Trevisa reported of it ""the herbe agnus-castus is always grene, and the flowre therof is namly callyd Agnus Castus, for wyth smel and vse it maketh men chaste as a lombe"".  Chaucer, in ""The Flower and the Leaf,"" referred to it as an attribute of the chaste Diana, and in the 16th century the English herbalist William Turner reported the same anaphrodisiac properties of the seed, both fried and not fried.","Circadian Rhythms,[orgf],13.04,C0008810|Eating,[orgf],13.00,C0013470|Males,[orga],11.49,C0086582|Growth,[orgf],9.85,C0018270|Body Fluids,[bdsu],6.79,C0005889|Heat (physical force),[npop],3.57,C0018837|"

"('myrrh', 'Attributed medicinal properties')","In pharmacy, myrrh is used as an antiseptic in mouthwashes, gargles, and toothpastes. It is also used in some liniments and healing salves that may be applied to abrasions and other minor skin ailments. Myrrh has been used as an analgesic for toothaches and can be used in liniment for bruises, aches, and sprains.Myrrh is a common ingredient of tooth powders. Myrrh and borax in tincture can be used as a mouthwash. A compound tincture, or horse tincture, using myrrh is used in veterinary practice for healing wounds. 
Myrrh gum is commonly claimed to remedy indigestion, ulcers, colds, cough, asthma, lung congestion, arthritis pain, and cancer. 
 In traditional Chinese medicine, myrrh is classified as bitter and spicy, with a neutral temperature. It is said to have special efficacy on the heart, liver, and spleen meridians as well as ""blood-moving"" powers to purge stagnant blood from the uterus. It is therefore recommended for rheumatic, arthritic, and circulatory problems, and for  amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, menopause, and uterine tumours.
Myrrh's uses are similar to those of frankincense, with which it is often combined in decoctions, liniments, and incense. When used in concert, myrrh is ""blood-moving"" while frankincense moves the qi, making it more useful for arthritic conditions.
It is combined with such herbs as notoginseng, safflower petals, angelica sinensis, cinnamon, and salvia miltiorrhiza, usually in alcohol, and used both internally and externally. 
 Myrrh is used in Ayurveda and Unani medicine, which ascribe tonic and rejuvenative properties to the resin. It (daindhava) is used in many specially processed rasayana formulas in Ayurveda. However, non-rasayana myrrh is contraindicated when kidney dysfunction or stomach pain is apparent or for women who are pregnant or have excessive uterine bleeding.
A related species, called guggul in Ayurvedic medicine, is considered one of the best substances for the treatment of circulatory problems, nervous system disorders, and rheumatic complaints.","Wound Healing,[orgf],23.12,C0043240|Toothache,[sosy],20.95,C0040460|Ache,[sosy],14.64,C0234238|Tooth structure,[bpoc],12.89,C0040426|Contusions,[inpo],11.49,C0009938|Pharmaceutical Services,[hlca],11.49,C0031321|Sprain,[inpo],6.66,C0038045|Asthma,[dsyn],17.80,C0004096|Gingiva,[tisu],16.30,C0017562|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Pain,[sosy],13.14,C0030193|Dyspepsia,[sosy],13.03,C0013395|Ulcer,[patf],11.49,C0041582|Arthritis,[dsyn],9.81,C0003864|Lung,[bpoc],6.66,C0024109|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],5.18,C0006826|In Blood,[bdsu],32.45,C0005768|Dysmenorrhea,[dsyn],20.95,C0013390|Blood,[bdsu],19.76,C0005767|Uterine Neoplasms,[neop],17.80,C0042138|Body Temperature,[orga],16.30,C0005903|Spleen,[bpoc],16.12,C0037993|Amenorrhea,[dsyn],13.05,C0002453|Uterus,[bpoc],12.89,C0042149|Liver,[bpoc],8.34,C0023884|Heart,[bpoc],6.59,C0018787|In Blood,[bdsu],16.12,C0005768|Blood,[bdsu],9.81,C0005767|Disease,[dsyn],9.72,C0012634|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Gravidity,[fndg],17.80,C0600457|Kidney Failure,[dsyn],16.63,C0035078|Renal Insufficiency,[dsyn],16.63,C1565489|Uterine hemorrhage,[patf],16.37,C0042134|nervous system disorder,[dsyn],5.18,C0027765|"

"('akebia, clematis stem', 'Use and toxicity')","The European species did not enter into the herbalists' pharmacopeia. In the American Old West, the Western white clematis, Clematis ligusticifolia, was called pepper vine by early travelers and pioneers, who took a tip from Spanish colonials and used seeds and the acrid leaves of yerba de chivato as a pepper substitute. The entire genus contains essential oils and compounds which are extremely irritating to the skin and mucous membranes.  Unlike black pepper or Capsicum, however, the compounds in clematis cause internal bleeding of the digestive tract if ingested in large amounts. C. ligusticifolia is essentially toxic. When pruning them, it is a good idea to wear gloves. Despite its toxicity, Native Americans used very small amounts of clematis as an effective treatment for migraine headaches and nervous disorders. It was also used as an effective treatment of skin infections. Clematis is also a constituent of Bach's Rescue Remedy.  Leaf extracts from two Ethiopian species (Clematis longicauda steud ex A. Rich. and Clematis burgensis Engl.) are used locally to treat ear disorders and eczema.  Phytochemical screening of the extracts from both of these species showed antibacterial and antifungal activity. The extracts of these plants also possess wound healing and anti-inflammatory activities which could also be attributed to the phytoconstituents.Clematis has been listed as one of the 38 plants used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health.

This rice is widely used in the traditional sweets of Assam, which are very different from the traditional sweets of India whose basic component is milk.
Such traditional sweets in Assam are Pitha (Narikolor pitha, Til pitha, Ghila pitha, Tel pitha, Kettle pitha, etc.).  Also, its powder form is used as breakfast or other light meal directly with milk. They are called Pitha guri (if powder was done without frying the rice, by just crushing it after soaking) or Handoh guri (if rice is dry fried first, and then crushed).
The soaked rice is also cooked with no added water inside a special kind of bamboo (called sunga saul bnaah). This meal is called sunga saul.
During religious ceremonies, Assamese people make Mithoi (Kesa mithoi and Poka mithoi) using Gnud with it. Sometimes Bhog, Payakh and Khir are also made from it using milk and sugar with it.
Different Assamese communities make rice beer from it which is preferred more than other rice, as it is sweeter and more alcoholic. They also offer this beer to their gods and ancestors (demi-gods). Rice cooked with it is also taken directly as lunch or dinner on rare occasions. 
 Sticky rice is used in many recipes throughout Southeast and East Asia.In Bangladesh,  especially in the Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Sylhet areas, the sticky rice called  bini dhan(unhusked sticky rice) is very popular. Both white and pink varieties are cultivated at many homestead farms. Husked sticky rice is called bini choil (chal) in some dialects.  Boiled or steamed bini choil is called Bini Bhat. With meat or fish curry and grated coconut, Bini Bhat is a popular breakfast. Sometimes it is eaten with a splash of sugar, salt, and coconut only without any curry. Bin dhan also used to make  khoi (pop rice like popcorn) and chida (bitten husked rice). A part of these many other sweet items made of bini choil are popular. 
One of the favorite pitas made of bini choil  is atikka pita (pita).It is made with the mixture of cubed or small sliced coconut, sugar or brown sugar, ripe banana and bini choil wrapped with banana leaf and steamed.
Another delicacy is Patishapta pita made of ground bini choil. Ground bini choil is sprayed over a hot pan and a mixture of grated coconut, sugar, milk powder; then ghee is sprayed over that and rolled out. Dumplings made of powdered fried bini choil  called laru. First bini choil is fried and ground into flour. This flour is mixed with sugar or brown sugar, and ghee or butter and is made into small balls or dumplings.
One kind of porridge or khir made of bini choil is called modhu (honey) bhat. This modhu bhat becomes naturally sweet without mixing any sugar. It is one of the delicacies of local people. To make modhu bhat first prepare some normal paddy or rice (dhan) for germination by soaking it in the water for few days. After coming out of little sprout dry the paddy and husk and grind the husked rice called jala choil into flour. It tastes sweet. Mixing this sweet flour with freshly boiled or steamed warm bini bhat and then fermenting the mixture overnight yields modhu bhat. It is eaten either on its own or with milk, jaggery or grated coconut. 
 Sticky rice is used in many recipes throughout Southeast and East Asia.Glutinous rice, called kao hnyin (          ), is very popular in Myanmar (also known as Burma).

Kao hnyin baung (                ) is a breakfast dish with boiled peas (p byouk) or with a variety of fritters, such as urad dal (baya gyaw), served on a banana leaf. It may be cooked wrapped in a banana leaf, often with peas, and served with a sprinkle of salted toasted sesame seeds and often grated coconut.
The purple variety, known as kao hynin ngacheik (                  ), is equally popular cooked as ngacheik paung.
They may both be cooked and pounded into cakes with sesame called hkaw bouk, another favourite version in the north among the Shan and the Kachin, and served grilled or fried.
The Htaman  pw  festival (       ) takes place on the full moon of Dabodw (        ) (February), when htaman  (    ) is cooked in a huge wok.  Two men, each with a wooden spoon the size of an oar, and a third man coordinate the action of folding and stirring the contents, which include kao hnyin, ngacheik, coconut shavings, peanuts, sesame and ginger in peanut oil.
Si htamin (       ) is glutinous rice cooked with turmeric and onions in peanut oil, and served with toasted sesame and crisp-fried onions; it is a popular breakfast like kao hnyin baung and ngacheik paung.
Paung din (         ) or ""Kao hyin kyi tauk"" (                    ) is another ready-to-eat portable form cooked in a segment of bamboo.  When the bamboo is peeled off, a thin skin remains around the rice and also gives off a distinctive aroma.
Mont let kauk  (             ) is made from glutinous rice flour; it is donut-shaped and fried like baya gyaw, but eaten with a dip of jaggery or palm sugar syrup.
Nga pyaw douk (         ) or ""Kao hynin htope"" (               ), banana in glutinous rice, wrapped in banana leaf and steamed and served with grated coconut - another favourite snack, like kao hnyin baung and mont let kauk,  sold by street hawkers.
Mont lone yay baw (               ) are glutinous rice balls with jaggery inside, thrown into boiling water in a huge wok, and ready to serve as soon as they resurface. Their preparation is a tradition during Thingyan, the Burmese New Year festival.
Htoe mont (         ), glutinous rice cake with raisins, cashews and coconut shavings, is a traditional dessert for special occasions. It is appreciated as a gift item from Mandalay. 
 Sticky rice is used in many recipes throughout Southeast and East Asia.In the Chinese language, glutinous rice is known as nu m  (  ) or chu t-b  (  ) in Hokkien.
Glutinous rice is also often ground to make glutinous rice flour. This flour is made into niangao and sweet-filled dumplings tangyuan, both of which are commonly eaten at Chinese New Year. It also used as a thickener and for baking.
Glutinous rice or glutinous rice flour are both used in many Chinese bakery products and in many varieties of dim sum. They produce a flexible, resilient dough, which can take on the flavors of whatever other ingredients are added to it.  Cooking usually consists of steaming or boiling, sometimes followed by pan-frying or deep-frying.
Sweet glutinous rice is eaten with red bean paste.
Nu m  f n (   ), is steamed glutinous rice usually cooked with Chinese sausage, chopped Chinese mushrooms, chopped barbecued pork, and optionally dried shrimp or scallop (the recipe varies depending on the cook's preference).
Zongzi (Traditional Chinese   /  , Simplified Chinese   ) is a dumpling consisting of glutinous rice and sweet or savory fillings wrapped in large flat leaves (usually bamboo), which is then boiled or steamed. It is especially eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival, but may be eaten at any time of the year. It is popular as an easily transported snack, or a meal to consume while traveling.  It is a common food among Chinese in  Hong Kong,  Singapore and Malaysia.
Cifangao (Traditional Chinese    , Simplified Chinese    ) is a popular breakfast food originating in Eastern China consisting of cooked glutinous rice compressed into squares or rectangles, and then deep-fried. Additional seasoning and ingredients such as beans, zha cai, and sesame seeds may be added to the rice for added flavour. It has a similar appearance and external texture to hash browns.
Cifantuan (Traditional Chinese    , Simplified Chinese    ) is another breakfast food consisting of a piece of youtiao tightly wrapped in cooked glutinous rice, with or without additional seasoning ingredients. Japanese onigiri resembles this Chinese food.
Lo mai gai (   ) is a dim sum dish consisting of glutinous rice with chicken in a lotus-leaf wrap, which is then steamed. It is served as a dim sum dish in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia.
Ba bao fan (   ), or ""eight treasure rice"", is a dessert made from glutinous rice, steamed and mixed with lard, sugar, and eight kinds of fruits or nuts. It can also be eaten as the main course.A distinctive feature of Hakka cuisine is its variety of steamed snack-type buns, dumplings and patties made with a dough of coarsely ground rice, or ban. Collectively known as ""rice snacks"", some kinds are filled with various salty or sweet ingredients.
Common examples of rice snacks made with ban from glutinous or sticky rice and non-glutinous rice include Aiban (mugwort patty), Caibao (turnip bun)[This 'turnip' is not the Western turnip. The proper name is yam bean. [In Mandarin Chinese, it is known as d ush (  ) or li ng sh  (  )] Ziba (sticky rice balls) and Bantiao (Mianpaban or flat rice noodles).
Aiban encompasses several varieties of steamed patties and dumplings of various shapes and sizes, consisting of an outer layer made of glutinous ban dough filled with salty or sweet ingredients. It gets its name from the aromatic ai grass (mugwort), which after being dried, powdered and mixed with the ban, gives the dough a green color and an intriguing tea-like taste. Typical salty fillings include ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded white turnips. The most common sweet filling is made with red beans.
Caibao is a generic term for all types of steamed buns with various sorts of filling. Hakka-style caibao are distinctive in that the enclosing skin is made with glutinous rice dough in the place of wheat flour dough. Besides ground pork, mushrooms and shredded turnips, fillings may include ingredients such as dried shrimp and dry fried-shallot flakes.
Ziba is glutinous rice dough which, after steaming in a big container, is mashed into a sticky, putty-like mass from which small patties are formed and coated with a layer of sugary peanut powder. It has no filling. 
 Sticky rice is used in many recipes throughout Southeast and East Asia.In the Philippines, glutinous rice is known as malagkit in Tagalog or pilit in Visayan, among other names. Both meaning ""sticky"". The most common way glutinous rice is prepared in the Philippines is through soaking uncooked glutinous rice in water or coconut milk (usually overnight) and then grinding it into a thick paste (traditionally with stone mills). This produces a rich and smooth viscous rice dough known as galap ng, which is the basis for numerous rice cakes in the Philippines. However, in modern preparation methods, galapong is sometimes made directly from dry glutinous rice flour (or from commercial Japanese mochiko), with poorer-quality results.Galapong was traditionally allowed to ferment, which is still required for certain dishes. A small amount of starter culture of microorganisms (tapay or bubod) or  palm wine (tub ) may be traditionally added to rice being soaked to hasten the fermentation. These can be substituted with yeast or baking soda in modern versions. Other versions of galapong may also be treated with wood ash lye.
Aside from the numerous white and red glutinous rice cultivars, the most widely used glutinous rice heirloom cultivars in the Philippines are tapol and pirurutong rice, both of which have colors ranging from purple, reddish brown, to almost black. However both varieties are expensive and becoming increasingly rare, thus some Filipino recipes nowadays substitute it with dyed regular glutinous rice or infuse purple yam (ube) to achieve the same coloration.Dessert delicacies in the Philippines are known as kakanin (from kanin, ""prepared rice""). These were originally made primarily from rice, but in recent centuries, the term has come to encompass dishes made from other types of flour, including corn flour (masa), cassava, wheat, and so on.  Glutinous rice figures prominently in two main subtypes of kakanin: the puto (steamed rice cakes), and the bibingka (baked rice cakes). Both largely utilize glutinous rice galapong. A notable variant of puto is puto bumbong, which is made with pirurutong.
Other kakanin that use glutinous rice include suman, biko, and sapin-sapin among others. There is also a special class of boiled galapong dishes like palitaw, moche, mache, and masi. Fried galapong is also used to make various types of buchi, which are the local Chinese-Filipino versions of jian dui. They are also used to make puso, which are boiled rice cakes in woven leaf pouches.
Aside from kakanin, glutinous rice is also used in traditional Filipino rice gruels or porridges known as lugaw. They include both savory versions like arroz caldo or goto which are similar to Chinese-style congee; and dessert versions like champorado, binignit, and ginataang mais.

"('fruit of glossy privet', 'Uses and cultivation')","In addition to being cultivated to create ornamental hedges and foliage, privet is also widely used in horticulture and flower arrangements. The Oval leaf privet Ligustrum ovalifolium is used for hedges, while its flexible twigs are sometimes used as cords for lashing. The tree species, especially Chinese privet is frequently used as a street tree in Europe, while other species including Ligustrum japonicum and Ligustrum quihoui are among the others also sometimes used as ornamental plants in gardens.
Privet became very popular in Britain as a replacement for ornamental railings around properties, which had been lost to the 1941 Government compulsorily requisitioning of all post-1850 iron gates and railings for the war effort  the idea being that the donated metal would be melted down for use in the manufacture of armaments in WWII, although this ultimately did not happen. The remaining stubbs of sawn-off railings can still be seen on many garden walls in the UK, often partly obscured by privet bushes.
Chinese privet is used in traditional herbal medicine. The decoction of privet leaves or bark helps to treat diarrhea, stomach ulcers, chronic bowel problems, chapped lips, sore mouths and throats, and a wash for skin problems. Privet leaves and bark have bitter properties that make a useful tea for improving appetite and digestion in chemotherapy patients.Some species produce a fruit, which is mildly toxic to humans. Symptoms from eating privet fruit include nausea, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure, and low body temperature. At least some privet species are known to be toxic to horses.","Cone-Rod Dystrophy 2,[dsyn],16.17,C3489532|Melting,[npop],16.26,C0599882|Vision,[orgf],16.14,C0042789|War,[acty],16.05,C0043027|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],45.86,C0007776|Diarrhea,[sosy],29.46,C0011991|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],26.83,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],26.83,C0022655|Gastric ulcer,[dsyn],20.95,C0038358|Abdominal Pain,[sosy],17.80,C0000737|Headache,[sosy],17.80,C0018681|Lip structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0023759|Desire for food,[orgf],16.04,C0003618|Hypothermia, natural,[fndg],14.64,C0020672|Nausea,[sosy],14.64,C0027497|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Digestion,[orgf],13.03,C0012238|Eating,[orgf],12.89,C0013470|Hypotension,[fndg],11.49,C0020649|Pharyngeal structure,[bpoc],11.49,C0031354|Intestines,[bpoc],9.78,C0021853|"

Most species have spectacular, colorful flowers and are often grown as ornamentals, and a number of cultivars have been developed. Their deep flowers attract large Lepidoptera - especially Sphingidae such as the pink-spotted hawk moth (Agrius cingulata) - or even hummingbirds.
The genus includes food crops; the tubers of sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) and the leaves of water spinach (I. aquatica) are commercially important food items and have been for millennia. The sweet potato is one of the Polynesian ""canoe plants"", transplanted by settlers on islands throughout the Pacific. Water spinach is used all over eastern Asia and the warmer regions of the Americas as a key component of well-known dishes, such as canh chua rau mu ng (Mekong sour soup) or callaloo; its numerous local names attest to its popularity. Other species are used on a smaller scale, e.g. the whitestar potato (I. lacunosa) traditionally eaten by some Native Americans, such as the Chiricahua Apaches, or the Australian bush potato (I. costata).
Peonidin, an anthocyanidin potentially useful as a food additive, is present in significant quantities in the flowers of the 'Heavenly Blue' cultivars.
Moon vine (I. alba) sap was used for vulcanization of the latex of Castilla elastica (Panama rubber tree, Nahuatl: olicu huitl) to rubber; as it happens, the rubber tree seems well-suited for the vine to twine upon, and the two species are often found together. As early as 1600 BCE, the Olmecs produced the balls used in the Mesoamerican ballgame.
The root called John the Conqueror in hoodoo and used in lucky and/or sexual charms (though apparently not as a component of love potions, because it is a strong laxative if ingested) usually seems to be from I. jalapa. The testicle-like dried tubers are carried as amulets and rubbed by the users to gain good luck in gambling or flirting. As Willie Dixon wrote, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, in his song ""Rub My Root"" (a Muddy Waters version is titled ""My John the Conquer Root""):
My pistol may snap, my mojo is frail
But I rub my root, my luck will never fail
When I rub my root, my John the Conquer root
Aww, you know there ain't nothin' she can do, Lord,
I rub my John the Conquer rootHumans use Ipomoea for their content of medical and psychoactive compounds, mainly alkaloids. Some species are renowned for their properties in folk medicine and herbalism; for example Vera Cruz jalap (I. jalapa) and Tampico jalap (I. simulans) are used to produce jalap, a cathartic preparation accelerating the passage of stool. Kiribadu Ala (giant potato, I. mauritiana) is one of the many ingredients of chyawanprash, the ancient Ayurvedic tonic called ""the elixir of life"" for its wide-ranging properties.
The leaves of I. batatas are eaten as a vegetable, and have been shown to slow oxygenation of LDLs, with some similar potential health benefits to green tea and grape polyphenols.
Other species were and still are used as potent entheogens. Seeds of Mexican morning glory (tlitliltzin, I. tricolor) were thus used by Aztecs and Zapotecs in shamanistic and priestly divination rituals, and at least by the former also as a poison, to give the victim a ""horror trip"" (see also Aztec entheogenic complex). Beach moonflower (I. violacea) was also used thus, and the cultivars called 'Heavenly Blue Morning Glory', touted today for their psychoactive properties, seem to represent an indeterminable assembly of hybrids of these two species.Ergoline derivatives (lysergamides) are probably responsible for the entheogenic activity. Ergine (LSA), isoergine, D-lysergic acid N-( -hydroxyethyl)amide and lysergol have been isolated from I. tricolor, I. violacea and/or purple morning glory (I. purpurea); although these are often assumed to be the cause of the plants' effects, this is not supported by scientific studies, which show although they are psychoactive, they are not notably hallucinogenic. Alexander Shulgin in TiHKAL suggests ergonovine is responsible, instead. It has verified psychoactive properties, though as yet other undiscovered lysergamides possibly are present in the seeds.
Though most often noted as ""recreational"" drugs, the lysergamides are also of medical importance. Ergonovine enhances the action of oxytocin, used to still post partum bleeding. Ergine induces drowsiness and a relaxed state and might be useful in treating anxiety disorder. Whether Ipomoea species are a useful source of these compounds remains to be determined. In any case, in some jurisdictions certain Ipomoea are regulated, e.g. by the Louisiana State Act 159 which bans cultivation of I. violacea except for ornamental purposes.

"('root of garden eggplant', 'Nutrition and health')","Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke.
The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat, and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.
However, vegetables often also contain toxins and antinutrients which interfere with the absorption of nutrients. These include  -solanine,  -chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, tannins and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used to ward off the insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.Fruit and vegetables, particularly leafy vegetables, have been implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. These foods are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily. The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes are not included in the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup. A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.International dietary guidelines are similar to the ones established by the USDA. Japan, for example, recommends the consumption of five to six servings of vegetables daily. French recommendations provide similar guidelines and set the daily goal at five servings. In India, the daily recommendation for adults is 275 grams (9.7 oz) of vegetables per day.","Cerebrovascular accident,[dsyn],35.81,C0038454|Eating,[orgf],26.49,C0013470|Coronary Arteriosclerosis,[dsyn],16.08,C0010054|Coronary Artery Disease,[dsyn],16.08,C1956346|Chronic disease,[dsyn],14.64,C0008679|Coronary heart disease,[dsyn],12.93,C0010068|Nutritional status,[fndg],12.89,C0392209|Diet therapy,[hlca],9.88,C0012159|Cardiovascular Diseases,[dsyn],5.18,C0007222|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.42,C0006826|Unmarried,[fndg],45.17,C0087136|Eating,[orgf],39.41,C0013470|Gender,[orga],17.80,C0079399|Set (Psychology),[menp],14.64,C0036849|Biological Absorption,[orgf],13.01,C2347023|sex,[orga],11.49,C1522384|Infection,[patf],6.83,C3714514|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|"
"('green tangerine peel', 'History')","Edgar Froese arrived in West Berlin in the mid-1960s to study art. His first band, the psychedelic rock-styled The Ones, disbanded after releasing only one single. After The Ones, Froese experimented with musical ideas, playing smaller gigs with a variety of musicians. Most of these performances were in the famous Zodiak Free Arts Lab, although one grouping also had the distinction of being invited to play for the surrealist painter Salvador Dal . The music was partnered with literature, painting, early forms of multimedia, and more. It seemed as though only the most outlandish ideas attracted any attention, leading Froese to comment: ""In the absurd often lies what is artistically possible."" As members of the group came and went, the direction of the music continued to be inspired by the Surrealists, and the group came to be called by the surreal-sounding name of Tangerine Dream, inspired by mis-hearing the line ""tangerine trees and marmalade skies"" from The Beatles' track ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".Froese was fascinated by technology and skilled in using it to create music. He built custom-made instruments and, wherever he went, collected sounds with tape recorders for use in constructing musical works later. His early work with tape loops and other repeating sounds was the obvious precursor to the emerging technology of the sequencer, which Tangerine Dream quickly adopted upon its arrival.
The first Tangerine Dream album, Electronic Meditation, was a tape-collage Krautrock piece, using the technology of the time rather than the synthesized music they later became famous for. The line-up for the album was Froese, Klaus Schulze, and Conrad Schnitzler. Electronic Meditation was published by Ohr in 1970 and began the period known as the Pink Years (the Ohr logo was a pink ear). Subsequent albums, beginning with Alpha Centauri, relied heavily on electronic instruments. The band's music during the early 1970s prominently featured organ from Steve Schroyder (on Alpha Centauri) or Peter Baumann (on subsequent releases), commonly augmented by guitar from Froese and drums from Christopher Franke. They also started their heavy usage of the Mellotron during this period. 
 Edgar Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. On 6 April 2015, the group's remaining members (Quaeschning, Schnauss and Yamane) and Bianca Acquaye (Froese's widow), pledged to continue working together in an effort to fulfill Froese's vision for the group. However, ex-member Jerome Froese announced in his Facebook time line that in his opinion Tangerine Dream will not exist without his father.Tangerine Dream played their first show following Froese's death on 9 June 2016 in Szczecin, Poland.On 29 September 2017, Tangerine Dream released their new studio album entitled Quantum Gate, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the band's foundation.","Sound - physical agent,[npop],39.73,C0037709|Dreams,[menp],32.63,C0013117|Inspiration function,[orgf],32.58,C0004048|Unmarried,[fndg],22.48,C0087136|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.29,C0030685|Attention,[menp],14.64,C0004268|meditation,[menp],32.78,C0150277|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.40,C0030685|Dreams,[menp],16.08,C0013117|Ear structure,[bpoc],9.99,C0013443|Dreams,[menp],49.51,C0013117|Widowhood,[fndg],22.61,C0206275|Cessation of life,[orgf],20.15,C0011065|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.75,C0030685|Pulmonary Embolism,[patf],16.18,C0034065|Vision,[orgf],16.18,C0042789|Anniversaries,[evnt],13.01,C0003097|"

"('hedge prinsepia nut', 'Cultivation')","The genus Prunus includes the almond, the nectarine and peach, several species of apricots, cherries, and  plums, all of which have cultivars developed for commercial fruit and nut production. The almond is not a true nut; the edible part is the seed. Other species are occasionally cultivated or used for their seed and fruit.
A number of species, hybrids, and cultivars are grown as ornamental plants, usually for their profusion of flowers, sometimes for ornamental foliage and shape, and occasionally for their bark.
The Tree of 40 Fruit has 40 varieties grafted on to one rootstock.Species such as blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), are grown for hedging, game cover, and other utilitarian purposes.
The wood of some species (notably black cherry) is prized as a furniture and cabinetry timber, especially in North America.
Many species produce an aromatic resin from wounds in the trunk; this is sometimes used medicinally. Other minor uses include dye production.
Pygeum, a herbal remedy containing extracts from the bark of Prunus africana, is used as to alleviate some of the discomfort caused by inflammation in patients suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Prunus species are food plants for the larvae of a large number of Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths); see List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus.
Prunus species are included in the Tasmanian Fire Service's list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.Because of their considerable value as both food and ornamental plants, many Prunus species have been introduced to parts of the world to which they are not native, some becoming naturalised.Ornamentals include the group that may be collectively called ""flowering cherries"" (including sakura, the Japanese flowering cherries).","Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.44,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.98,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.98,C0022655|Transplanted tissue,[tisu],6.68,C0332835|Wood material,[sbst],13.02,C0043217|Injury wounds,[inpo],3.43,C0043250|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.31,C0007776|Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,[dsyn],13.14,C1704272|Mental Suffering,[mobd],13.02,C0683278|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.85,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.85,C0022655|Inflammation,[patf],9.90,C0021368|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Fire - disasters,[phpr],9.85,C0016141|"

"('hedge prinsepia nut', 'Benefits to human health')","People are often encouraged to consume many fruits because they are rich in a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that are supposedly beneficial to human health. The fruits of Prunus often contain many phytochemicals and antioxidants. These compounds have properties that have been linked to preventing different diseases and disorders.  Research suggests that the consumption of these fruits reduces the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and other age-related declines. Many factors  can affect the levels of bioactive compounds in the different fruits of the genus Prunus, including the environment, season, processing methods, orchard operations, and postharvest management.Cherries contain many different phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, which are indicators of being rich in antioxidants. Recent research has linked the phenolic compounds of the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) with antitumor properties.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) include superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen; they are the byproducts of metabolism. High levels of ROS lead to oxidative stress, which causes damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The oxidative damage results in cell death, which ultimately leads to numerous diseases and disorders. Antioxidants act as a defense mechanism against the oxidative stress. They are used to remove the free radicals in a living system that are generated as ROS. Some of those antioxidants include gutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. The antioxidants present in cherry extracts act as inhibitors of the free radicals. However, the DNA and proteins can be damaged when  an imbalance occurs in the level of free radicals and the antioxidants. When not enough antioxidants are available to remove the free radicals,  many diseases can occur, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, etc. Recent studies have shown that using natural antioxidants as a supplement in chemotherapy can decrease the amount of oxidative damage. Some of these natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid, tocopherol, and epigallocatechin gallate; they can be found in certain cherry extracts.

Many factors  can affect the levels of bioactive compounds in the different fruits of the genus Prunus, including the environment, season, processing methods, orchard operations, and postharvest management.Similar to cherries, strawberries, and raspberries, almonds are also rich in phenolics. Almonds have a high oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), which is another indicator of being rich in antioxidants. As stated before, high levels of free radicals are harmful, thus having the capacity to absorb those radicals is greatly beneficial. The bioactive compounds, polyphenols and anthocyanins, found in berries and cherries are also present in almonds. Almonds also contain nonflavonoid and flavonoid compounds, which contribute to the antioxidant properties of almonds. Flavonoids are a group of structurally related compounds that are arranged in a specific manner and can be found in all vascular plants on land. They also contribute to the antioxidant properties of almonds. Some of the nonflavonoid compounds present are protocatechuic, vanillic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acids. Flavonoid compounds that can be found in the skin of the almond are flavanols, dihydroflavonols, and flavanones.

Carotenoids are the pigments that give the pulp and peel of apricots and other Prunus fruits their yellow and orange colors. Moreover, it is an essential precursor for vitamin A, which is especially important for vision and the immune system in humans. Moreover, these fruits are quite rich in phenolic substances, including catechin, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid.

"('notoginseng flos', 'Preparation')","Chinese patent medicine (   ;    ; zh ngch ng y o) is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word. No one has exclusive rights to the formula. Instead, ""patent"" refers to the standardization of the formula. In China, all Chinese patent medicines of the same name will have the same proportions of ingredients, and manufactured in accordance with the PRC Pharmacopoeia, which is mandated by law. However, in western countries there may be variations in the proportions of ingredients in patent medicines of the same name, and even different ingredients altogether.Several producers of Chinese herbal medicines are pursuing FDA clinical trials to market their products as drugs in U.S. and European markets.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.09,C0599638|Cold Temperature,[npop],22.53,C0009264|Hand,[bpoc],14.64,C0018563|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Esthesia,[ortf],9.85,C0036658|"
"('notoginseng flos', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

"('pokeberry root', 'Toxicity, poisoning and mortality')","All parts of the plant are toxic and pose risks to human and mammalian health. In summary, the poisonous principles are found in highest concentrations in the rootstock, then in leaves and stems and then in the ripe fruit. The plant generally gets more toxic with maturity, with the exception of the berries (which have significant toxicity even while green).Children may be attracted by clusters of berries. Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) note that
Children are most frequently poisoned by eating raw berries. Infants are especially sensitive and have died from eating only a few raw berries. Adults have been poisoned, sometimes fatally, by eating improperly prepared leaves and shoots, especially if part of the root is harvested with the shoot, and by mistaking the root for an edible tuber. Research with humans has also shown that common pokeweed can cause mutations (possibly leading to cancer) and birth defects. Since the juice of pokeweed can be absorbed through the skin, contact of plant parts with bare skin should be avoided.

Pokeweed is to be avoided during pregnancy and children consuming even one berry may require emergency treatment. The plant sap can cause dermatitis in sensitive people.Birds are apparently immune to this poison. The plant is not palatable to animals and is avoided unless little else is available, or if it is in contaminated hay, but horses, sheep and cattle have been poisoned by eating fresh leaves or green fodder, and pigs have been poisoned by eating the roots.Human deaths resulting from pokeweed consumption are uncommon, but cases of emesis and catharsis are known, and a child who consumed crushed seeds in a juice is reported to have died. If death occurs, it is usually due to respiratory paralysis.Historically, pokeweed poisonings were common in eastern North America during the 19th century, especially from the use of tinctures as antirheumatic preparations and from ingestion of berries and roots that were mistaken for parsnip, Jerusalem artichoke, or horseradish.Owen states:
If taken internally, pokeweed is a slow acting but a violent emetic. Vomiting usually starts about 2 hours after the plant or parts of it have been eaten. Severe cases of poisoning result in purging, spasms, and sometimes convulsions. If death occurs, it is usually due to paralysis of the respiratory organs. Cases of animal or human poisoning should be handled by a veterinarian or a physician.

The OARDC staff scientists note that immediate and subsequent symptoms of poisoning from pokeweed include ""a burning sensation in the mouth, salivation, gastrointestinal cramps, and vomiting and bloody diarrhea"", and that depending upon the amount consumed, more severe symptoms can occur, including ""anemia, altered heart rate and respiration, convulsions and death from respiratory failure."" If only small quantities of the plant or its extracts are ingested, people and animals may recover within one to two days.","Mental concentration,[menp],3.57,C0086045|Eating,[orgf],39.59,C0013470|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],32.40,C0040452|Mutation,[genf],11.49,C0026882|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.88,C0011065|Congenital Abnormality,[cgab],8.34,C0000768|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.83,C0020517|Congenital defects,[cgab],5.18,C0220810|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.59,C0006826|Cessation of life,[orgf],31.15,C0011065|Eating,[orgf],26.22,C0013470|Catharsis,[menp],17.80,C0007421|Respiratory Paralysis,[fndg],16.22,C0035232|Pregnancy,[orgf],13.05,C0032961|Vomiting,[sosy],12.91,C0042963|Dermatitis,[dsyn],9.87,C0011603|Poisoning,[inpo],6.83,C0032343|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.59,C0332679|Hypersensitivity,[patf],6.59,C0020517|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.57,C0009830|Spasm,[sosy],17.80,C0037763|Respiratory Paralysis,[fndg],16.18,C0035232|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Poisoning,[inpo],13.44,C0032343|Eating,[orgf],13.44,C0013470|Convulsions,[sosy],13.14,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],13.14,C0036572|Violence,[mobd],12.91,C0042693|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|secretion of saliva,[ortf],17.80,C0036104|heart rate,[clna],16.37,C0018810|Muscle Cramp,[sosy],16.30,C0026821|In Blood,[bdsu],16.07,C0005768|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Sialorrhea,[dsyn],14.64,C0037036|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Diarrhea,[sosy],13.14,C0011991|Anemia,[dsyn],11.49,C0002871|Burning Mouth Syndrome,[dsyn],9.91,C0006430|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.88,C0011065|Respiratory Failure,[dsyn],9.79,C1145670|Blood,[bdsu],9.76,C0005767|Cell Respiration,[celf],8.34,C0282636|Poisoning,[inpo],6.59,C0032343|"
"('pokeberry root', 'Uses')","Pokeweed berries are reported to be a good food source for songbirds such as gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinals), brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), other bird species including mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum). Small mammals apparently tolerant of its toxins include raccoon, opossum, red and gray fox, and the white-footed mouse.Pokeweed is used as a sometime food source by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the giant leopard moth (Hypercompe scribonia).Some pokeweeds are grown as ornamental plants, mainly for their attractive berries. A number of cultivars have been selected for larger fruit panicles. 
 Owen notes that ""Indians and early settlers used the root in poultices and certain drugs for skin diseases and rheumatism.""The late 19th century herbal, the King's American Dispensatory, describes various folk medical uses that led individuals to ingest pokeberry products. Phytolacca extract was advertised as a prescription weight loss drug in the 1890s.Pokeweed is promoted in alternative medicine as a dietary supplement that can treat a wide range of maladies including mumps, arthritis and various skin conditions. While pokeweed has been subject to laboratory research, there is no medical evidence that it has any beneficial effect on human health. 
 Poke is a traditional southern Appalachian food. The leaves and stems of very young plants can both be eaten, but must be cooked, usually boiled three times in fresh water each time. The leaves have a taste similar to spinach; the stems taste similar to asparagus. To prepare stems, harvest young stalks prior to chambered pith formation, carefully peel the purple skin away, then chop the stalk up and fry in meal like okra.  A typical recipe for preparation of pokeweed leaves is to remove the leaves from the plant, rinse the leaves in cool water, bring the leaves to a rolling boil in a large pot about 20 minutes, pour the leaves into a sieve (discarding the cooking water), rinse them in cool water, repeat the boiling and the rinsing at least two more times, panfry the leaves in bacon grease for a couple of minutes, add bacon, and salt & pepper to taste.The root are never eaten and cannot be made edible, but a late 19th century herbal, the King's American Dispensatory, describes various folk medical uses that led individuals to ingest pokeberry products, and festivals still celebrate the plant's use in its historical food preparations (see below). 
 Plant toxins from Phytolacca are being explored as a means to control zebra mussels.The toxic extract of ripe pokeweed berries can be processed to yield a pink dye.During the middle of the 19th century wine often was coloured with juice from pokeberries.","Grief reaction,[menp],13.14,C0018235|Mourning,[menp],13.14,C0086644|Gigantism,[dsyn],12.94,C0017547|Mumps,[dsyn],20.95,C0026780|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],16.18,C0040452|Dermatologic disorders,[dsyn],13.52,C0037274|Prescription procedure,[hlca],13.01,C0033080|Arthritis,[dsyn],11.49,C0003864|Collagen Diseases,[dsyn],11.49,C0009326|Rheumatism,[dsyn],11.49,C0035435|Drinking Water,[sbst],68.47,C0599638|Taste Perception,[ortf],39.89,C0039336|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],32.55,C0935572|Eating,[orgf],27.04,C0013470|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],17.80,C0040452|Vision,[orgf],16.26,C0042789|Fresh Water,[sbst],12.92,C0016710|Festivals,[acty],11.49,C0015922|furuncle,[dsyn],11.12,C0242301|Marijuana Abuse,[mobd],9.86,C0024809|"
"('calyx and receptacle of a persimmon', 'Uses')","Berries, defined loosely, have been valuable as a food source to humans since prior to the start of agriculture, and remain among the primary food sources of other primates. Botanically defined berries with culinary uses include:

Berries in the strictest sense: including bananas and plantains, blueberries, cranberries, the seeds of coffee berries, gooseberries, red-, black- and white currants, tomatoes, grapes and peppers (Capsicum fruits)
Hesperidia: citrus fruits, including oranges, lemons and limes
Pepos: cucurbits, including squashes, cucumbers, melons and watermelonsSome berries are brightly coloured, due to plant pigments such as anthocyanins and other flavonoids. These pigments are localized mainly in the outer surface and the seeds. Such pigments have antioxidant properties in vitro, but there is no reliable evidence that they have antioxidant or any other useful functions within the human body. Consequently, it is not permitted to claim that foods containing plant pigments have antioxidant health value on product labels in the United States or Europe.Some spices are prepared from berries. Allspice is made from the dried berries of Pimenta dioica. The fruits (berries) of different cultivars of Capsicum annuum are used to make paprika (mildly hot), chili pepper (hot) and cayenne pepper (very hot). 
 Pepos, characterized by a hard outer rind, have also been used as containers by removing the inner flesh and seeds and then drying the remaining exocarp. The English name of Lagenaria siceraria, ""bottle gourd"", reflects its use as a liquid container.Some true berries have also been used as a source of dyes. In Hawaii, these included berries from a species of Dianella, used to produce blue, and berries from black nightshade (Solanum americanum), used to produce green. 
 Cucurbit berries or pepos, particularly from Cucurbita and Lagenaria, are the earliest plants known to be domesticated   before 9,000 10,000 BP in the Americas, and probably by 12,000 13,000 BP in Asia. Peppers were domesticated in Mesoamerica by 8,000 BP. Many other early cultivated plants were also berries by the strict botanical definition, including grapes, domesticated by 8,000 BP and known to have been used in wine production by 6,000 BP.Bananas were first domesticated in Papua New Guinea and Southeast Asia. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence at Kuk Swamp in the Western Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea suggests that banana cultivation there goes back to at least 7,000 BP, and possibly to 10,000 BP.The history of cultivated citrus fruit remains unclear, although some recent research suggests a possible origin in Papuasia rather than continental southeast Asia. Chinese documents show that mandarins and pomelos were established in cultivation there by around 4,200 BP. 
 According to FAOSTAT data, in 2013 four of the five top fruit crops in terms of world production by weight were botanical berries. The other was a pome (apples).
 Citrus fruit includes, but is not limited to, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit (including pomelos), tangerines, mandarins, clementines and satsumas. Oranges make up 53% of the total.
According to FAOSTAT, in 2001, bananas (including plantains) and citrus comprised over 25% by value of the world's exported fruits and vegetables, citrus fruits being more valuable than bananas. Export quantities of fruit are not entirely comparable with production quantities, since slightly different categories are used.

"('sandalwood', 'Uses')","Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, foug re, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the ""floriental"" (floral-ambery) fragrance family   when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, etc.
Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as ""sandalwood"". The genus Santalum has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (Amyris balsamifera) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense, Myoporaceae). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years.
Isobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.
Sandalwood's main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy and to prepare soaps. 
 Due to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy. 
 Aboriginal Australians eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as quandong (S. acuminatum).
Early Europeans in Australia used quandong in cooking damper by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit. In Scandinavia, pulverised bark from red sandalwood (Pterocarpus soyauxii) is used - with other tropical spices - when marinating anchovies and some types of pickled herring such as matjes, sprat, and certain types of traditional spegesild, inducing a redish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.Present-day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for macadamia nuts or a bush food substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine. The oil is also used as a flavor component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavoring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.","Wood material,[sbst],39.25,C0043217|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.01,C0026131|Fragrance (odor),[npop],10.89,C2987717|Wood material,[sbst],13.02,C0043217|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.55,C2987717|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.68,C2987717|Isomerism (chemical phenomenon),[npop],13.02,C0022203|Fluorescence,[npop],22.61,C0016315|Submersion,[inpo],6.71,C0038561|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|flavor enhancers,[sbst],59.29,C0682897|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.43,C0007776|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.97,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.97,C0022655|"
"('henbane seed', 'Historical use')","The name henbane dates at least to AD 1265.  The origins of the word are unclear, but ""hen"" probably originally meant death rather than referring to chickens. Other etymologies of the word associate it with the Indo-European stem *bhelena whose hypothetical meaning is 'crazy plant' and with the Proto-Germanic element bil meaning  vision, hallucination; magical power, miraculous ability .Henbane was historically used in combination with other plants, such as mandrake, deadly nightshade, and datura, as an anaesthetic potion, as well as for its psychoactive properties in ""magic brews"".  These psychoactive properties include visual hallucinations and a sensation of flight. It was originally used in continental Europe, Asia, and the Arab world, though it did spread to England in the Middle Ages. The use of henbane by the ancient Greeks was documented by Pliny who said it was ""of the nature of wine and therefore offensive to the understanding"", and by Dioscorides who recommended it as a sedative and analgesic.  The plant, recorded as Herba Apollinaris, was used to yield oracles by the priestesses of Apollo. Recently evidence for its earlier use in the Scottish Neolithic has been debated. John Gerard's Herball states: ""The leaves, the seeds and the juice, when taken internally cause an unquiet sleep, like unto the sleep of drunkenness, which continueth long and is deadly to the patient. To wash the feet in a decoction of Henbane, as also the often smelling of the flowers causeth sleep.""The plant was also purportedly used as a fumigant for magical purposes. Albertus Magnus, in his work De Vegtabilibusm (1250), reported that necromancers used henbane to invoke the souls of the dead as well as demons. Henbane was already being demonized as early as the Late Middle Ages when it became inseparably associated with witchcraft and malefic practices.  The witches drank the decoction of henbane and had those dreams for which they were tortured and executed. It was also used for witches  ointments and was used for making weather and conjuring spirits. If there were a great drought then a stalk of henbane would be dipped into a spring, then the sun-baked sand would be sprinkled with this  (Perger 1864, 181). During a Pomeranian witchcraft trial in 1538, a suspected witch ""confessed"" that she had given a man henbane seeds so that he would run around ""crazy"" (sexually aroused). In a file from an Inquisition trial, it was noted that ""a witch admits"" having once strewn henbane seeds between two lovers and uttering the following formula: ""Here I sow wild seed, and the devil advised that they would hate and avoid each other until these seeds had been separated"" (Marzell 1922, 169).Henbane was one of the ingredients in gruit, traditionally used in beers as a flavouring. Several cities, most notably Pilsen, were named after its German name ""Bilsenkraut"" in the context of its production for beer flavouring. The recipe for henbane beer includes 40 g dried chopped henbane herbage, 5 g bayberry, 23 l water, 1 l brewing malt, 900 g honey, 5 g dried yeast, and brown sugar. Henbane fell out of usage for beer when it was replaced by hops in the 11th to 16th centuries, as the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 outlawed ingredients other than barley, hops, yeast, and water.Henbane is sometimes identified with the ""hebenon"" poured into the ear of Hamlet's father, although other candidates for hebenon exist.Henbane seeds have been found in a Viking grave that was unearthed near Fyrkat, Denmark in 1977. This and other archaeological finds show that H. niger was known to the Vikings. Analysis of the symptoms caused by intoxication of this plant suggest that it may have been used by berserkers to induce the rage state that they used in war.","Drinking Water,[sbst],45.68,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],39.43,C0682897|Hallucinations,[mobd],20.95,C0018524|Hallucinations, Visual,[sosy],20.95,C0233763|Sleep,[orgf],19.78,C0037313|Cessation of life,[orgf],19.74,C0011065|Sunlight,[npop],19.25,C0038817|Droughts,[npop],16.25,C0013140|War,[acty],16.21,C0043027|Dreams,[menp],16.18,C0013117|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],16.18,C0935572|Weather,[npop],16.18,C0043085|Rage,[menp],14.64,C0034634|Wakefulness,[menp],14.64,C0043012|Ability,[orga],13.14,C0085732|Alzheimer disease, familial, type 3,[dsyn],13.02,C1843013|Foot,[bpoc],13.01,C0016504|Smell Perception,[orgf],13.01,C0037361|Natural Springs,[npop],12.96,C3179043|Comprehension,[menp],12.89,C0162340|Hate,[menp],11.49,C0018616|Desiccation,[npop],10.28,C0011682|Sleep Drunkenness,[mobd],9.89,C0234455|Esthesia,[ortf],9.88,C0036658|Ear structure,[bpoc],9.86,C0013443|Males,[orga],9.78,C0086582|Separated from cohabitee,[fndg],5.18,C0086972|"

In all preparations, the dosage has to be carefully estimated due to the high toxicity of henbane. For some therapeutic applications, dosages like 0.5 g and 1.5  3 g were used. The lethal dosage is not known.Henbane is toxic to cattle, wild animals, fish, and birds.

"('henbane seed', 'Effects')","Henbane ingestion by humans is followed simultaneously by peripheral inhibition and central stimulation. Common effects of henbane ingestion include hallucinations, dilated pupils, restlessness, and flushed skin. Less common effects are tachycardia, convulsions, vomiting, hypertension, hyperpyrexia, and ataxia. Initial effects typically last for three to four hours, while aftereffects may last up to three days. The side effects of henbane ingestion are dryness in the mouth, confusion, locomotor and memory disturbances, and farsightedness. Overdosages result in delirium, coma, respiratory paralysis, and death. Low and average dosages have inebriating and aphrodisiac effects.In his book How Do Witches Fly?, Alexander Kuklin refers to an experience of black henbane had by German scientist Michael Schenck. Schenck recollected his experience: 

The henbane's first effect was purely physical discomfort. My limbs lost certainty, pains hammered in my head, and I began to feel extremely giddy....I went to the mirror and was able to distinguish my face, but more dimly than normal. It looked flushed and must have been so. I had the feeling that my head had increased in size: it seemed to have grown broader, more solid heavier, and I imagined that it was enveloped in firmer, thicker skin. The mirror itself seemed to be swaying, and I found it difficult to keep my face within its frame. The black discs of my pupils were immensely enlarged, as though the whole iris, which was normally blue, had become black. Despite of' the dilation of my pupils I could see no better than usual; quite the contrary, the outlines of objects were hazy, the window and the window frame were obscured by a thin mist.

Schenck s pulse became rapid and he experienced a further increase in the hallucinogenic effects of the plant: 

There were animals which looked at me keenly with contorted grimaces and staring, terrified eyes; there were terrifying stones and clouds of mist, all sweeping along in the same direction. They carried me irresistibly with them. Their coloring must be described - but it was not a pure hue. They enveloped in a vague gray light, which emitted a dull glow and rolled onward and upward into a black and smoky sky. I was flung into a flaring drunkenness, a witches' cauldron of madness. Above my head water was flowing, dark and blood-red. The sky was filled with herds of animals. Fluid, formless creatures emerged from the darkness. I heard words, but they were all wrong and nonsensical, and yet they possessed for me some hidden meaning.","Comatose,[dsyn],24.11,C0009421|Cerebellar Ataxia,[dsyn],20.95,C0007758|Hallucinations,[mobd],20.95,C0018524|Psychomotor Agitation,[fndg],20.95,C3887612|Delirium,[mobd],19.36,C0011206|Ataxia,[sosy],17.80,C0004134|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Respiratory Paralysis,[fndg],17.80,C0035232|Mental Recall,[menp],16.59,C0034770|Apraxia, oculomotor, Cogan type,[cgab],14.64,C0543874|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Flushing,[sosy],14.64,C0016382|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Tachycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0039231|Vomiting,[sosy],14.64,C0042963|Xerostomia,[fndg],13.08,C0043352|Psychological inhibition,[menp],13.03,C0021467|Cessation of life,[orgf],11.49,C0011065|Hyperopia,[dsyn],11.49,C0020490|Hypertensive disease,[dsyn],11.49,C0020538|Mydriasis,[sosy],11.49,C0026961|Memory impairment,[mobd],4.12,C0233794|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Feelings,[menp],16.77,C1527305|Pupil,[bpoc],16.04,C0034121|Dizziness,[sosy],16.03,C0012833|Vertigo,[sosy],16.03,C0042571|Ability,[orga],14.64,C0085732|Flushing,[sosy],14.64,C0016382|Pain,[sosy],14.64,C0030193|Iris (Eye),[bpoc],13.14,C0022077|Mydriasis,[sosy],9.87,C0026961|Physical Examination,[hlca],9.78,C0031809|Limb structure,[bpoc],8.34,C0015385|Pulse Rate,[clna],16.25,C0232117|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Light,[npop],16.17,C0023693|In Blood,[bdsu],16.12,C0005768|Eye,[bpoc],13.14,C0015392|Darkness,[npop],13.03,C0010986|Alcoholic Intoxication,[mobd],13.02,C0001969|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Calculi,[bdsu],9.99,C0006736|Blood,[bdsu],9.81,C0005767|Smoking,[inbe],9.76,C0037369|Anger,[menp],9.70,C0002957|Body Fluids,[bdsu],8.34,C0005889|Nonsense mutation,[comd],3.82,C0544885|"

From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut into tiny pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills.These medicines are not patented in the traditional sense of the word.

"('rhizome of common curculigo', 'Toxicity')","From the earliest records regarding the use of medicinals to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese medicinals including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most medicinals, efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of medicinals, with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst ""concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation."" Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.Substances known to be potentially dangerous include aconite, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata, Ban mao), and certain fungi. There are health problems associated with Aristolochia. Toxic effects are also frequent with Aconitum. To avoid its toxic adverse effects Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Reynoutria multiflora (synonym Polygonum multiflorum), glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The evidence suggests that hepatotoxic herbs also include Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora; although there is no evidence that they cause liver damage. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to have the potential for toxicity.Also, adulteration of some herbal medicine preparations with conventional drugs which may cause serious adverse effects, such as corticosteroids, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, and glibenclamide, has been reported.However, many adverse reactions are due to misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine. For example, the misuse of the dietary supplement Ephedra (containing ephedrine) can lead to adverse events including gastrointestinal problems as well as sudden death from cardiomyopathy. Products adulterated with pharmaceuticals for weight loss or erectile dysfunction are one of the main concerns. Chinese herbal medicine has been a major cause of acute liver failure in China.Most Chinese herbs are safe but some have shown not to be. Reports have shown products being contaminated with drugs, toxins, or false reporting of ingredients. Some herbs used in TCM may also react with drugs, have side effects, or be dangerous to people with certain medical conditions.","Talus,[bpoc],24.11,C0039277|Weight decreased,[fndg],24.11,C1262477|Confusion,[mobd],16.17,C0009676|Liver Failure, Acute,[dsyn],16.08,C0162557|Erectile dysfunction,[dsyn],14.64,C0242350|Sudden death,[patf],13.10,C0011071|Creativity,[menp],12.83,C0010297|Toxic effect of heavy metal,[inpo],10.43,C0274869|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cardiomyopathies,[dsyn],9.75,C0878544|Liver,[bpoc],6.83,C0023884|Bodily secretions,[bdsu],6.71,C0036537|Poisoning,[inpo],6.58,C0032343|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.43,C0006826|"

"('abrus precatorius l.', 'Uses')","The seeds of Abrus precatorius are much valued in native jewelry for their bright coloration. Most beans are black and red, reminiscent of a ladybug, though other colors exist. Jewelry-making with jequirity seeds is somewhat hazardous.  There are persistent reports that the workers who pierce the seeds in order to thread them can suffer poisoning or even death from a pinprick, but there seems to be little evidence. An online search found 265 scientific papers referring to Abrus precatorius, but not one of them dealt with occupational poisoning.In Trinidad in the West Indies the brightly colored seeds are strung into bracelets and worn around the wrist or ankle to ward off jumbies or evil spirits and ""mal-yeux"" the evil eye. The Tamils use Abrus seeds of different colors. The red variety with black eye is the most common, but there are black, white and green varieties as well.
In March 2012 a recall was issued for bracelets made using Jequirity Beans sold by the Eden Project and other outlets in the UK. 
 The seeds of Abrus precatorius are very consistent in weight. Formerly Indians used these seeds to weigh gold using a measure called a Ratti, where 8 Ratti = 1 Masha; 12 Masha = 1 Tola (11.6 Grams). 
 According to the 1898 King's American Dispensatory,
Abrus seeds are the agents by which the Cham r or ""Native Skinner"" caste of India carry on the felonious poisoning of cattle for the purpose of securing their hides. This is done by means of small spikes, called sui (needles) or sutari (awls), which are prepared by soaking the awl in a thin paste of the water-soaked, pounded seeds, and then drying the weapon in the sun, after which it is oiled and sharpened upon stone, affixed in a handle, and then used to puncture the skin of the animal.
An 1881 work by the District Superintendent of Police for British-occupied Bengal details the preparation and use of the sutari for the killing of cattle and in at least six murder cases. A native, promised a reduced sentence for the poisoning of a fellow villager's bullock in exchange for his testimony, demonstrated the technique. First the outer shells of red or white seeds were cracked between stones, then the two cotyledons from within thirty or forty seeds were soaked in water for ten minutes. These seeds were ground to a paste and rolled up into six sharp-ended one-inch cones, which were inserted into either end of three pieces of straw and ""exposed to the moderate influence of the sun"" to dry, whereupon they regained some of the original hardness of the seed. In this account, the sutaries were described as being these cones, entirely made up of the hardened seed paste. The dried cones were checked for sharpness, and if need be, whetted with a brick and re-set. Finally, to prevent softening, they were waterproofed by ""burying them for a night in some sort of animal grease."" For testing, which Major Ramsay asked to be done exactly like a surreptitious killing, the prisoner set two sutaries into a 1.5-inch wooden handle meant to be held in the hand by pressing them into a rag stretched over sockets in the wood. A wandering ""Brahmanee bull"" was procured, and the prisoner brought the sutari down in one direction and away in the other, so as to break off the cones inside the animal's flesh behind the horn, then pressed the skin over the broken ends leaving no obvious trace of the injury. This process was repeated with two more cones to the base of the animal's tongue. The bull died after 34.5 hours, leaving no visible trace of the sutaries but a small amount of pus at the wound site, whose swelling had mostly subsided by the time of death.The 1890 Pharmacographia Indica gives an account, based in part on the above work, describing the sutaris or suis (the terms being equivalent, depending on district, with the former based on the object's resemblance to the point of a cobbler's awl). It describes the sutaris as 3/4 inch long and weighing 1.5 to 2 grains, varying in color from dirty white to black, and describes the handle as 3 to 3.5 inches long and frequently made from two joints of bamboo wood, with sockets 1/4 to 3/8 inch deep and with the cavity exposed at one end for storage of additional sutaris. The weapons were sometimes made with the milky juice of Calotropis gigantea instead of water, which was said to speed the effect, and were sometimes supplemented with metallic mercury, dhatura, aconite, and/or arsenic. It is added that ""any attempt to withdraw the sutari by pulling at the pieces sticking out, invariably breaks it, a portion being left in the wound.""  One man murdered by a single blow with a pair of sutaris died after three days; another, from whom the material had been successfully excised, died three days later of tetanus. The price of one of these killings was said to total 16.5 rupees; the killers were punished by transportation for life. 
 Abrus precatorius, called kundu mani in Tamil, Guruvinda ginja in Telugu and 'Kunni kuru' in Malayalam, has been used in Siddha medicine for centuries.  The white variety is used to prepare oil that is claimed to be an aphrodisiac.  A tea is made from the leaves and used for fevers, coughs and colds. Seeds are poisonous and therefore are used after mitigation. The Tamil Siddhars knew about the toxic effects in plants and suggested various methods which is called ""suththi seythal"" or purification. This is done by boiling the seeds in milk and then drying them. The protein is denatured when subjected to high temperatures which removes its toxicity.The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia  records that ""The roots of this plant are used in India as a substitute for liquorice, though they are somewhat bitter. In Java the roots are considered demulcent. The leaves, when mixed with honey, are applied to swellings, and in Jamaica are used as a substitute for tea. Under the name of ""Jequirity"" the seeds have recently been employed in cases of ophthalmia, a use to which they have long been put in India and Brazil.""The plant is also used in Ayurveda and is said to promote hair growth. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in Indian hair products.","Eye,[bpoc],26.13,C0015392|Mental Suffering,[mobd],14.64,C0683278|Poisoning,[inpo],13.83,C0032343|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.87,C0011065|Disease,[dsyn],9.77,C0012634|Mental Recall,[menp],17.80,C0034770|Hydranencephaly with Renal Aplasia-Dysplasia,[dsyn],13.14,C1856053|Body Weight,[orga],22.36,C0005910|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.34,C0599638|Sunlight,[npop],19.20,C0038817|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Calculi,[bdsu],9.90,C0006736|Carrying,[acty],9.86,C0206243|Puncture procedure,[hlca],8.34,C0034117|Poisoning,[inpo],6.70,C0032343|Paste substance,[sbst],3.42,C0030634|Retinal Cone,[cell],118.54,C0206428|Drinking Water,[sbst],45.60,C0599638|Cessation of life,[orgf],40.94,C0011065|Set (Psychology),[menp],26.11,C0036849|Wood material,[sbst],26.04,C0043217|Unmarried,[fndg],22.48,C0087136|Term Birth,[orgf],19.75,C0233324|Sunlight,[npop],19.31,C0038817|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.12,C0014518|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.10,C0026131|Tetanus,[dsyn],16.07,C0039614|Dental caries,[dsyn],13.03,C0011334|Hand,[bpoc],13.03,C0018563|Pus,[bdsu],12.89,C0034161|Tongue,[bpoc],12.89,C0040408|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Edema,[sosy],11.49,C0013604|Traumatic injury,[inpo],10.65,C3263723|Males,[orga],9.99,C0086582|Calculi,[bdsu],9.90,C0006736|Sclerosis,[patf],9.69,C0036429|Horns,[bpoc],8.34,C0019939|Injury wounds,[inpo],7.11,C0043250|Paste substance,[sbst],7.01,C0030634|Poisoning,[inpo],6.57,C0032343|Fever,[sosy],26.27,C0015967|Kuru,[dsyn],16.30,C0022802|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.05,C0026131|Common Cold,[dsyn],14.64,C0009443|Coughing,[sosy],14.64,C0010200|Hair,[bpoc],13.36,C0018494|Endophthalmitis,[dsyn],13.02,C0014236|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Growth,[orgf],9.99,C0018270|Edema,[sosy],9.86,C0013604|furuncle,[dsyn],3.55,C0242301|"

"('datura flower', 'Toxicity')","All Datura plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and atropine, primarily in their seeds and flowers as well as the roots of certain species such as D. wrightii. Because of the presence of these substances, Datura has been used for centuries in some cultures as a poison. A given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations make Datura exceptionally hazardous as a drug.
In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura was critical to minimize harm. Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting Datura. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of adolescents and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting Datura. There are also several reports in the medical literature of deaths from D. stramonium and D. ferox intoxication. Children are especially vulnerable to atropine poisoning.In some parts of Europe and India, Datura has been a popular poison for suicide and murder. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in Agra, India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting Datura. The Thugs (practicers of thuggee) were devotees of an Indian religious cult made up of robbers and assassins who strangled and/or poisoned their victims in rituals devoted to the Hindu goddess Kali. They were known to employ Datura in many such poisonings, using it also to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier.Datura toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of honey produced by several wasp species, including Brachygastra lecheguana, during the Datura blooming season. It appears that these semi-domesticated honey wasps collect Datura nectar for honey production which can lead to poisoning.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested Datura used as an ingredient in stew.In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate Datura plants.Due to the potent combination of anticholinergic substances it contains, Datura intoxication typically produces effects similar to that of an anticholinergic delirium (usually involving a complete inability to differentiate reality from fantasy); hyperthermia; tachycardia; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe mydriasis (dilated pupils) with resultant painful photophobia that can last several days. Muscle stiffness, urinary retention, temporary paralysis, and confusion is often reported and pronounced amnesia is another commonly reported effect. 
 All Datura plants contain tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and atropine, primarily in their seeds and flowers as well as the roots of certain species such as D. wrightii. Because of the presence of these substances, Datura has been used for centuries in some cultures as a poison. A given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. These variations make Datura exceptionally hazardous as a drug.
In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura was critical to minimize harm. Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting Datura. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of adolescents and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting Datura. There are also several reports in the medical literature of deaths from D. stramonium and D. ferox intoxication.

Christian R tsch has said ""A mild dosage produces medicinal and healing effects, a moderate dosage produces aphrodisiac effects, and high dosages are used for shamanic purposes"". Wade Davis (anthropologist), an ethnobotanist, lists it as a possible ingredient of zombie potion.In Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs, Freye asserts:
Few substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has Datura. The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of Datura find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and often physically dangerous.  However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura, have been known to use Datura spiritually (including the Navajo and especially the Havasupai). Again, knowledge of Datura's properties is necessary to facilitate a healthy experience.
The Southern Paiute believe Datura can help locate missing objects. In ancient Mexico, Datura also played an important role in the religion of the Aztecs and the practices of their medicine men and necromancers.Bernardino de Sahag n, in around 1569, called attention to Datura in the following words: 
 It is administered in potions in order to cause harm to those who are objects of hatred. Those who eat it have visions of fearful things. Magicians or those who wish to harm someone administer it in food or drink. This herb is medicinal and its seed is used as a remedy for gout, ground up and applied to the part affected.

Gastric lavage and the administration of activated charcoal can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material and the drug physostigmine is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. Benzodiazepines can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24 36 hours after ingestion of the Datura.","Weather,[npop],16.09,C0043085|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cessation of life,[orgf],30.12,C0011065|Poisoning,[inpo],20.65,C0032343|Mydriasis,[sosy],20.39,C0026961|Amnesia,[mobd],19.45,C0002622|Photophobia,[sosy],19.40,C0085636|Delirium,[mobd],19.19,C0011206|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Urinary Retention,[fndg],17.80,C0080274|Expiration, function,[orgf],16.44,C0231800|Fantasy,[menp],16.07,C0015630|Suicide,[fndg],16.05,C0038661|Fever,[sosy],14.64,C0015967|Tachycardia,[fndg],14.64,C0039231|Choking,[patf],13.28,C0008301|Paralysed,[fndg],13.14,C0522224|Lead Poisoning,[inpo],13.14,C0023176|Hospitalization,[hlca],13.05,C0019993|Pain,[sosy],12.94,C0030193|Violence,[mobd],12.89,C0042693|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],10.13,C0011119|Accidents,[phpr],9.81,C0000924|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.73,C0162867|Muscle Tissue,[tisu],6.66,C0026845|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.56,C0009830|Weather,[npop],16.09,C0043085|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cessation of life,[orgf],30.12,C0011065|Poisoning,[inpo],20.65,C0032343|Expiration, function,[orgf],16.44,C0231800|Suicide,[fndg],16.05,C0038661|Choking,[patf],13.28,C0008301|Lead Poisoning,[inpo],13.14,C0023176|Hospitalization,[hlca],13.05,C0019993|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],10.13,C0011119|Cocaine Abuse,[mobd],9.98,C0009171|Accidents,[phpr],9.81,C0000924|Wound Healing,[orgf],9.81,C0043240|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.73,C0162867|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.56,C0009830|Attention,[menp],13.03,C0004268|Hallucinations, Visual,[sosy],19.36,C0233763|Gout,[dsyn],17.80,C0018099|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Affect (mental function),[menp],10.28,C0001721|Hate,[menp],9.76,C0018616|Fear (Mental Process),[menp],9.75,C0015726|Weather,[npop],16.09,C0043085|Disease,[dsyn],9.90,C0012634|Cessation of life,[orgf],30.12,C0011065|Poisoning,[inpo],27.69,C0032343|Gastric Absorption,[ortf],22.50,C3850075|Confusion,[mobd],17.80,C0009676|Expiration, function,[orgf],16.44,C0231800|Patient observation,[hlca],16.24,C0700325|Respiratory Diaphragm,[bpoc],16.18,C0011980|Suicide,[fndg],16.05,C0038661|Choking,[patf],13.28,C0008301|Lead Poisoning,[inpo],13.14,C0023176|Hospitalization,[hlca],13.05,C0019993|Somnolence,[mobd],11.49,C2830004|Decompression Sickness,[dsyn],10.13,C0011119|Accidents,[phpr],9.81,C0000924|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.73,C0162867|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.56,C0009830|"
"('wild chrysanthemum flower', 'Economic uses')","Modern cultivated chrysanthemums are showier than their wild relatives. The flower heads occur in various forms, and can be daisy-like or decorative, like pompons or buttons. This genus contains many hybrids and thousands of cultivars developed for horticultural purposes. In addition to the traditional yellow, other colors are available, such as white, purple, and red. The most important hybrid is Chrysanthemum   morifolium (syn. C.   grandiflorum), derived primarily from C. indicum, but also involving other species.
Over 140 cultivars of chrysanthemum have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).Chrysanthemums are divided into two basic groups, garden hardy and exhibition. Garden hardy mums are new perennials capable of wintering in most northern latitudes. Exhibition varieties are not usually as sturdy. Garden hardies are defined by their ability to produce an abundance of small blooms with little if any mechanical assistance, such as staking, and withstanding wind and rain. Exhibition varieties, though, require staking, overwintering in a relatively dry, cool environment, and sometimes the addition of night lights.
The exhibition varieties can be used to create many amazing plant forms, such as large disbudded blooms, spray forms, and many artistically trained forms, such as thousand-bloom, standard (trees), fans, hanging baskets, topiary, bonsai, and cascades.
Chrysanthemum blooms are divided into 13 different bloom forms by the US National Chrysanthemum Society, Inc., which is in keeping with the international classification system. The bloom forms are defined by the way in which the ray and disk florets are arranged. Chrysanthemum blooms are composed of many individual flowers (florets), each one capable of producing a seed. The disk florets are in the center of the bloom head, and the ray florets are on the perimeter. The ray florets are considered imperfect flowers, as they only possess the female reproductive organs, while the disk florets are considered perfect flowers, as they possess both male and female reproductive organs.
Irregular incurves are bred to produce a giant head called an ogiku. The disk florets are concealed in layers of curving ray florets that hang down to create a 'skirt'. Regular incurves are similar, but usually with smaller blooms and a dense, globular form. Intermediate incurve blooms may have broader florets and a less densely flowered head.
In the reflex form, the disk florets are concealed and the ray florets reflex outwards to create a mop-like appearance. The decorative form is similar to reflex blooms, but the ray florets usually do not radiate at more than a 90  angle to the stem.
The pompon form is fully double, of small size, and very globular in form. Single and semidouble blooms have exposed disk florets and one to seven rows of ray florets. In the anemone form, the disk florets are prominent, often raised and overshadowing the ray florets. The spoon-form disk florets are visible and the long, tubular ray florets are spatulate. In the spider form, the disk florets are concealed, and the ray florets are tube-like with hooked or barbed ends, hanging loosely around the stem. In the brush and thistle variety, the disk florets may be visible.
In Japan, a form of bonsai chrysanthemum was developed over the centuries. The cultivated flower has a lifespan of about 5 years and can be kept in miniature size. Another method is to use pieces of dead wood and the flower grows over the back along the wood to give the illusion from the front that the miniature tree blooms. 
 Yellow or white chrysanthemum flowers of the species C. morifolium are boiled to make a tea in some parts of Asia. The resulting beverage is known simply as chrysanthemum tea (   , pinyin: j hu  ch , in Chinese). In Korea, a rice wine flavored with chrysanthemum flowers is called gukhwaju (   ).
Chrysanthemum leaves are steamed or boiled and used as greens, especially in Chinese cuisine. The flowers may be added to dishes such as mixian in broth, or thick snakemeat soup (  ) to enhance the aroma. Small chrysanthemums are used in Japan as a sashimi garnish. 
 Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum [or Tanacetum] cinerariaefolium) is economically important as a natural source of insecticide. The flowers are pulverized, and the active components, called pyrethrins, which occur in the achenes, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. In sublethal doses, they have an insect-repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides. They are not persistent, being biodegradable, and also decompose easily on exposure to light. Pyrethroids such as permethrin are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum. Despite this, chrysanthemum leaves are still a major host for destructive pests, such as leafminer flies including L. trifolii.Persian powder is an example of industrial product of chrysanthemum insecticide.

"('chinese rose flower', 'Uses')","Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having mutated into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England. 
 Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have been also used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale.
In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa   damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In other parts of the world Rosa   centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.
The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil.  -Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.Rose hips are occasionally made into jam,  jelly, marmalade, and soup or are brewed for tea, primarily for their high vitamin C content. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used heavily in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine especially in sweets such as barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, gumdrops, kanafeh, nougat, and Turkish delight.
Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas.
In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated  squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.Rose flowers are used as food, also usually as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The rose hip, usually from R. canina, is used as a minor source of vitamin C. The fruits of many species have significant levels of vitamins and have been used as a food supplement. Many roses have been used in herbal and folk medicines. Rosa chinensis has long been used in Chinese traditional medicine. This and other species have been used for stomach problems, and are being investigated for controlling cancer growth. In pre-modern medicine, diarrhodon (Gr          , ""compound of roses"", from      , ""of roses"") is a name given to various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the Iliad, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the ""immortal oil of the rose"" and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him ""among rose blossoms"". The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel The Golden Ass by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity.Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The color of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity.
 Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht D rer's painting The Feast of the Rosary (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her worshippers.Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses.
Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redout  is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.
Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose 'Fantin-Latour' was named after the artist.
Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul C zanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works.","Breeding,[orgf],9.85,C0006159|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Breeding,[orgf],10.28,C0006159|Breeding,[orgf],9.74,C0006159|Avian crop,[bpoc],13.55,C0010352|Disease,[dsyn],9.85,C0012634|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Plague,[dsyn],20.95,C0032064|Climate,[npop],16.30,C0008946|Air (substance),[sbst],16.21,C0001861|Weather,[npop],16.21,C0043085|Carrying,[acty],11.49,C0206243|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Temperance,[inbe],6.60,C0039475|Body Weight,[orga],45.08,C0005910|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|Pallor,[fndg],12.94,C0030232|Darkness,[npop],12.91,C0010986|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Crushing injury,[inpo],6.59,C0332679|Fragrance (odor),[npop],6.90,C2987717|Hip structure,[bpoc],53.62,C0019552|Bone structure of ischium,[bpoc],38.71,C0022122|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Muscle strain,[inpo],3.82,C0080194|Drinking Water,[sbst],22.61,C0599638|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.40,C0682897|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.24,C0682897|flavor enhancers,[sbst],58.68,C0682897|Freezing,[npop],16.04,C0016701|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.57,C2987717|Hip structure,[bpoc],14.64,C0019552|Bone structure of ischium,[bpoc],19.45,C0022122|Hip structure,[bpoc],13.14,C0019552|Stomach,[bpoc],13.03,C0038351|Growth,[orgf],9.87,C0018270|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Malignant Neoplasms,[neop],3.56,C0006826|In Blood,[bdsu],16.04,C0005768|Tooth Crowns,[bpoc],16.04,C0226993|Eating,[orgf],14.64,C0013470|Creativity,[menp],12.93,C0010297|Alzheimer disease, familial, type 3,[dsyn],12.92,C1843013|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.87,C0027627|Personality Character,[menp],9.99,C0007952|Blood,[bdsu],9.74,C0005767|Avian crop,[bpoc],6.77,C0010352|Injury wounds,[inpo],3.98,C0043250|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.98,C3263723|Rough endoplasmic reticulum,[celc],28.87,C0230779|War,[acty],16.16,C0043027|Tooth Crowns,[bpoc],16.03,C0226993|Conflict (Psychology),[inbe],9.75,C0009671|Happiness,[menp],9.73,C0018592|Childbirth,[orgf],16.08,C1148523|"

"('chinese honeylocust abnormal fruit', 'Causes of plant galls')","Insect galls are the highly distinctive plant structures formed by some herbivorous insects as their own microhabitats. They are plant tissue which is controlled by the insect.  Galls act as both the habitat and food source for the maker of the gall. The interior of a gall can contain edible nutritious starch and other tissues. Some galls act as ""physiologic sinks"", concentrating resources in the gall from the surrounding plant parts. Galls may also provide the insect with physical protection from predators.Insect galls are usually induced by chemicals injected by the larvae of the insects into the plants, and possibly mechanical damage. After the galls are formed, the larvae develop inside until fully grown, when they leave. In order to form galls, the insects must take advantage of the time when plant cell division occurs quickly: the growing season, usually spring in temperate climates, but which is extended in the tropics.
The meristems, where plant cell division occurs, are the usual sites of galls, though insect galls can be found on other parts of the plant, such as the leaves, stalks, branches, buds, roots, and even flowers and fruits.  Gall-inducing insects are usually species-specific and sometimes tissue-specific on the plants they gall.Gall-inducing insects include gall wasps, gall midges, gall flies, Agromyzidae aphids (such as Melaphis chinensis,  Pemphigus spyrothecae, and Pemphigus betae), scale insects, goldenrod gall fly, psyllids and weevils.Galls produced by insects and mites include:

Ash flower gall: this gall is caused by a small mite that causes irregular distortion of male flowers. The galls are initially green, then dry and turn brown.
Ash midrib gall: normally 0.5 to 1 inch long, these galls are succulent and have thick walls. A small cavity within each gall contains one or more small maggots, the larval stages of very small flies called midges. Female midges lay their eggs in very young leaflets during early spring. Gall formation begins soon after the eggs are laid. Specifics of the biology of this insect are not known. The galls probably do not harm tree health.
Elm cockscomb gall: these distinct galls, caused by an aphid, are about one inch long and about 1/4 inch high. The irregular edge of the gall and its red color at maturity account for the common name. The galls dry, harden and turn brown as they age. Aphids may be seen through a slit-like opening in the underside of the gall. This insect has a complex life cycle it forms galls on elm in early summer, then feeds on grass roots later in the summer. The galls apparently do not cause significant harm to the tree.
Hackberry leaf gall: this gall is caused by a small (0.1 inch long) aphid-like insect with sucking mouthparts called a jumping plant louse. The adults spend the winter under bark crevices and can invade houses in large numbers in the fall. Females lay eggs over a long period of time beginning when leaves begin to unfold from the buds in the spring. Feeding by the nymphs that hatch from these eggs causes abnormal plant growth that forms a pouch. The psyllids remain inside the galIs until they emerge as adults in late summer to early fall. There is one generation each year. Heavy infestations can result in premature leaf drop which over a series of years may affect tree health.
Honeylocust pod gall: this gall is caused by a small fly (midge). The sunburst cultivar appears to be very susceptible to this pest. Infested leaves have globular or pod-like distortions that contain one to several small maggots (0.25 inch long). Infestations begin when females lay eggs in young leaflets. There are five or more generations each year. Infested leaves often drop prematurely and repeated damage can kill small branches. New shoots develop at the base of dead twigs. As a result, the natural shape of the tree may be lost.
Oak gall: see Oak apple
Petiole and stipule galls: thick globe-like galls can develop on leaf petioles and stems. Many of these are caused by insects called phylloxerans which are very similar to aphids. The hard, woody galls may remain on the tree for several years. Usually, there is one generation each year and the insects over winter on the tree in the egg stage.
Willow shoot galls: these swellings on shoots, twigs, or leaf petioles, may be caused by small flies (midges) or small wasps (sawflies). The gall increases in size as long as the immature stages are active. They cause no significant injury. The infestation may be reduced by pruning and destroying the galled areas before the adult insect emerges, usually in late summer.
Witchhazel gall: this gall is caused by an aphid that passes the winter in eggs laid on twigs of the plant. Feeding by the aphid causes the formation of conical galls on the upper side of the leaf. Each gall, produced by a single aphid, later becomes filled with offspring. Mature aphids with wings leave the galls in late spring and early summer and fly to birch. After several generations there, the insects return to witch hazel to lay the eggs that survive the winter. No galls are formed on the birch. 
 Many rust fungi induce gall formation, including western gall rust, which infects a variety of pine trees and cedar-apple rust. Galls are often seen in Millettia pinnata leaves and fruits. Leaf galls appear like tiny clubs; however, flower galls are globose. Exobasidium often induces spectacular galls on its hosts.
The fungus Ustilago esculenta associated with Zizania latifolia, a wild rice, produces an edible gall highly valued as a food source in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces of China. 
 Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas savastanoi are examples of gall-causing bacteria. 
Gall forming virus was found on rice plants in central Thailand in 1979 and named rice gall dwarf. Symptoms consisted of gall formation along leaf blades and sheaths, dark green discoloration, twisted leaf tips and reduced numbers of tillers. Some plants died in the glasshouse in later stages of infection. The causal agent was transmitted by Nephotettix nigropictus after an incubation of two weeks. Polyhedral particles of 65 nm diameter in the cytoplasm of phloem cells were always associated with the disease. No serologic relationship was found between this virus and that of rice dwarf. 
 Nematodes are microscopic worms that live in the soil. Some nematodes (Meloidogyne species or root-knot nematodes) cause galls on the roots of susceptible plants. The galls are small, individual and beadlike in some hosts. In other plant species galls may be massive accumulations of fleshy tissue more than an inch in diameter. Some ectoparasitic nematodes (nematodes that live outside the plant in the soil), such as sting and stubby-root nematodes, may cause root tips to swell. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium species) cause swellings on the roots of most legumes (such as clover, peas and beans). These swellings, called nodules, are easily distinguished from root-knot galls by differences in how they are attached to the root and their contents. Nodules are loosely attached to the root, while root-knot galls originate from infection at the center of the root, so they are an integral part of the root. In addition, fresh Rhizobium nodules have a milky pink-to-brown liquid inside them, while root-knot galls have firmer tissues and contain female root-knot nematodes (creamy white beads less than 1/32-inch in diameter) inside the gall tissues. 
 Mistletoe can form galls on its hosts.","Cell division,[celf],19.52,C0007590|Climate,[npop],16.18,C0008946|Body tissue,[tisu],10.42,C0040300|Physical Examination,[hlca],9.74,C0031809|Temperance,[inbe],6.66,C0039475|Pemphigus,[dsyn],26.44,C0030807|Cell division,[celf],19.45,C0007590|Stalking (behavior),[mobd],17.80,C0935572|Species Specificity,[npop],6.79,C0037783|Tissue Specificity,[ortf],6.67,C2713393|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Males,[orga],9.74,C0086582|Natural Springs,[npop],13.04,C3179043|Dental caries,[dsyn],13.01,C0011334|Females,[orga],9.81,C0086287|Vision,[orgf],16.14,C0042789|Desiccation,[npop],11.49,C0011682|Sclerosis,[patf],10.18,C0036429|Cerebral cortex,[bpoc],22.32,C0007776|Premature Birth,[patf],16.18,C0151526|Natural Springs,[npop],13.25,C3179043|Adrenal Cortex,[bpoc],12.86,C0001613|Structure of cortex of kidney,[bpoc],12.86,C0022655|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Females,[orga],11.49,C0086287|Plant Development,[orgf],10.06,C0597252|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.63,C0030499|Plague,[dsyn],19.20,C0032064|Eye,[bpoc],13.28,C0015392|Females,[orga],11.49,C0086287|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.86,C0011065|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],3.98,C0030499|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Eye,[bpoc],13.14,C0015392|Wood material,[sbst],12.89,C0043217|Ovum,[cell],12.89,C0029974|Edema,[sosy],9.85,C0013604|Parasitic Diseases,[dsyn],5.18,C0030499|Traumatic injury,[inpo],3.68,C3263723|Unmarried,[fndg],22.48,C0087136|Retinal Cone,[cell],22.30,C0206428|Natural Springs,[npop],12.85,C3179043|Vision,[orgf],16.14,C0042789|Dwarfism,[cgab],26.26,C0013336|Foreskin of penis,[bpoc],16.59,C0227952|Cytoplasm,[celc],13.01,C0010834|Cessation of life,[orgf],9.88,C0011065|disease transmission,[patf],9.88,C0242781|Communicable Diseases,[dsyn],9.74,C0009450|Infection,[patf],6.59,C3714514|associated disease,[patf],3.62,C0243083|Cells,[cell],3.43,C0007634|Tooth root structure,[bpoc],210.49,C0040452|Soil,[sbst],26.27,C0037592|Edema,[sosy],20.03,C0013604|Plant Tumors,[neop],20.02,C0032091|Milk (body substance),[bdsu],16.00,C0026131|Body tissue,[tisu],10.87,C0040300|Trematode Infections,[dsyn],9.99,C0040820|Communicable Diseases,[dsyn],9.90,C0009450|Females,[orga],9.77,C0086287|Helminthiasis,[dsyn],6.83,C0018889|Infection,[patf],6.74,C3714514|Sting Injury,[inpo],5.18,C0038340|"

"('ramine root ', 'Uses')","The term digital rhetoric was coined by rhetorician Richard A. Lanham in his 1993 essay collection, The Electronic Word: Democracy, Technology, and the Arts. In 2009, rhetorician Elizabeth Losh offered this four-part definition of digital rhetoric in her book, Virtualpolitik:
The conventions of new digital genres that are used for everyday discourse, as well as for special occasions, in average people's lives.
Public rhetoric,  often in the form of political messages from government institutions, is represented or recorded through digital technology and disseminated via electronically distributed networks.
The emerging scholarly discipline concerned with the rhetorical interpretation of computer-generated media as objects of study.
Mathematical theories of communication from the field of information science, many of which attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a given linguistic exchange or the likely paths through which messages travel.""Losh's definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric is a heterodoxical field, one that relies on different methods to study various permutations of information: as code, as text, as visuals, as videos, and so on.Though influenced by Lanham and Losh, Douglas Eyman also offers a definition of digital rhetoric in his 2015 book Digital Rhetoric: Theory, Method, Practice:  ... the application of rhetorical theory (as analytic method or heuristic for production) to digital texts and performances . Eyman s definition demonstrates that digital rhetoric can be applied in two ways: 1) as an analytic method, digital rhetoric can be used to analyze a digital text, and 2) as a heuristic for production. It offers rhetorical questions that a composer can use to create digital texts.Eyman locates the emerging field of digital rhetoric as interdisciplinary in nature, enriched by related fields such as, but not limited to: digital literacy, visual rhetoric, new media, human-computer interaction and critical code studies.Some scholars' interpretation of this concept focuses more on the digital aspect. Casey Boyle, James Brown Jr., and Steph Ceraso claim that ""the digital"" is no longer just one of the many different tools that can be used to enhance traditional rhetoric, but an ""ambient condition"" that encompasses our everyday lives. In other words, as technology becomes more and more ubiquitous, the lines between traditional and digital rhetoric will start to blur. In addition, Boyle et. al emphasize the idea that both technology and rhetoric can influence and transform each other. 
 As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an encyclopedia. Teachers can use podcasts, YouTube videos, and social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic. In addition, they can make use of distance learning modules, as a form of online teaching. In academia, online journals allow for information to be more accessible due to the use of digital rhetoric. Writers also have more opportunities to write in various formats instead of a traditional linear format. In social media, people come into contact with digital rhetoric on a daily basis whether it be an updated Facebook status, a 140 character tweet, or even the use of visual rhetoric on websites such as Instagram. Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities. This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.The urge for digital rhetoric to be introduced to classrooms is the fact that in the era of web 2.0, quite a proportion of school managements and instructors stick to the traditional rhetoric and resist the pervasiveness of technology. For the first time, the knowledge taught at and the methods employed by the academia are far behind the social and cultural advancement, rather than leading it. As Clark (2010) argues, ""...the traditional essayistic literacy ... needs to be replaced by an intentional pedagogy of digital rhetoric that emphasizes the civic importance of education..."".In universities, courses on digital rhetoric are taught at the graduate and undergraduate level as courses in English, Communication, and Media Studies departments. Courses in digital rhetoric study the interactions between users and digital texts, as well as how different backgrounds such as age, ethnicity, gender and more can affect these interactions. By studying digital rhetoric in this way, students are able to better understand the uses and purpose of digital rhetoric in the modern world.
Scholars like Jeff Grabill contribute to the use of digital rhetoric by pushing for its use in the classroom. Grabill embraces the age of technology and encourages his contemporaries to do so as well. His backgrounds in English, education, and technology and work in those fields make him a gateway between the scholarly field of digital rhetoric and its implementation. Another scholar, Cheryl Ball, specializes in areas that consist of multimodal composition and editing practices, digital media scholarship, and digital publishing. She also focuses on university writing pedagogy. Ball teaches people to write and compose multimodal texts by analyzing rhetorical options and choosing the most appropriate genres, technologies, media, and modes for a particular situation. During her own education, Ball made significant advances in the digital rhetoric field by completing her school's first electronic and interactive thesis. She also received tenure at another university using the first all-digital tenure portfolio. For her undergraduate course, Clark created and employed a set of practices, including ePortfolios, digital stories, online games, Second Life, and blogs. In doing so, she managed to ""engage(s) students in the interactivity, collaboration, ownership, authority, and malleability of texts"". In another approach, Douglas Eyman recommends a course in web authoring and design that provides undergraduates more practical instruction in the production and rhetorical understanding of digital texts. Moreover, he explains that web authoring and design for digital rhetoric instruction provides opportunities for students to learn fundamentals of web writing and design conventions, rules and procedures. Attention to multimodality has  also influenced Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing  by Elizabeth Losh and Alexander Jonathan, which emphasized engaging the comic form of literacy.
Digital rhetoric pedagogy has been further developed in the secondary level of education due to support at the university level. This allows for students to create and edit projects simultaneously through the internet. Collaboration is seen as one of the biggest advantages to digital rhetoric, as it gives students and teachers the ability to collaborate and critique anywhere anytime. By being educated in various forms of technology, students are exposed to a more multimodal world and teachers foster a more well-rounded learning environment. Through digital writing, students have a broader choice of composing to fit their needs.  Students can have people see their work anywhere, which reflects the accessibility of social media that students are used to in their everyday lives. 
 As the power of technology grows, so too do the uses and scope of digital rhetoric. This includes schools offering online classes and test-taking, online news sources including scholarly journals and online editions of newspapers, and people searching for information online rather than consult a more traditional means such as an encyclopedia. Teachers can use podcasts, YouTube videos, and social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to facilitate discussions and increase students' interest in a topic.

Social media is being used universally to allow for people to connect from all places. The choice of one's rhetoric can influence and alter other peoples opinions and thoughts on certain subjects impacting the ideology of collective identity vs. individual identities. This scope of influence that digital rhetoric obtains can also be seen in commercial branding and politics.The increase in digitalization of media has amplified the importance of digital rhetoric in politics as it has introduced a new relationship between politicians and the citizenry. Digital communication platforms and social networking sites (SNS) are means of allowing citizens to share information and engage in debate with other people of similar or distinct political ideologies. The topics and ideas communicated through digital rhetoric have been shown to influence and predict the political behavior of individuals outside the digital world. Politicians have been known to use digital rhetoric as a tool to communicate information to the citizens. Likewise, digital rhetoric  has enabled  increasing political participation. Theoretical political research on digital rhetoric has attributed to the increase of political participation to three models; these include the motivation model, learning model, and attitude model. In 2008, the first wide scale political campaign through Twitter was utilized by President Obama. This success is measured in the over half a billion dollars raised through the internet. This use of social media has become a large asset for all political candidates and is currently utilized by all. The 2016 elections brought social media to the forefront and all presidential candidates utilized different forms of persuasion in their 140 character tweets.

The motivation model proposes that digital rhetoric has decreased the opportunity costs of participating in politics since it makes information readily available to the people.
The learning model established the increase in political participation to the vast amount of political information available in the internet which increases the inclusion of the citizens in the political process.
The attitude model extended from the previous two by suggesting that digital rhetoric has changed the perception of citizens towards politics, particularly by providing interactive tools that allow people to engage in the political process.Social media incorporates numerous characteristics of interactions between people in the public sphere. Social media is not  characterized as an ideal public sphere because it fails to provide equitable access to information and participation for women and minority groups. Nevertheless, social media has shown to be  useful in the propagation of digital rhetoric for political campaigns as shown in Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns in which digital rhetoric made its first successful appearance at a U.S presidential  election   which marked a guideline for future elections.  The presence of digital media companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter has been well established in the promotion of digital rhetoric for political purposes. These firms have influenced the political process by providing strategic information about people demographics, behaviors, attitudes, and interests, all of which have increased the efficiency of political discourse   especially for political campaigns. In 2013, Twitter released a manual targeted towards politicians that outlined the main features of their platform and how they can be used to increase political communications. In 2018, Facebook devoted $62,500 dollars to create a space for politicians to learn ways in which they can use digital rhetoric in Facebook to increase the impact of there campaigns.  Steir conducted a study to analyze the different types of rhetoric that took place in social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter; during the 2013 election campaign for the German Bundestag, he found that the types of information that politicians share on both platforms varied   Facebook was found to be the preferred medium for campaign rhetoric, while Twitter was mostly utilized for rhetoric regarding political debates, infrastructure discussions, and law and order.Digital media has increased its domination of the political sphere, especially with social media. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become a significant part of the political engagement process with regard to elections, campaigns, or elected officials trying to connect with their constituencies. Social media globalizes communication. Especially political communication, fostering discussions and connecting communities as it reaches a significant number of people. Amidst all of these outlets, Twitter is the form of social media that s primarily used by candidates running for public office, elected officials, and government agencies.
Currently, in the 115th Congress, 428 out of 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives have Twitter.
On the Senate side, all 100 members are active on Twitter.Members of Congress use Twitter, and other forms of social media, to connect with their constituency. Members use social media to convey their stances on important issues, bills they have sponsored or have positions on. They use it to post about events they are hosting and the work they do in Congress. This includes meetings with constituents in Washington and back in their districts. According to former Congressman George Miller, Twitter is a mechanism to answer questions from people in his district. Conversely, Representative John Culberson said he uses Twitter to assist people in engaging themselves in their government. Many of these sites provide features for people to connect with their elected officials. For example, on Facebook the Town Hall feature connects users with their federal, and state officials. According to PEW Research center 20% of people who use social media have taken advantage of the fact that they can connect very easily with their officials by a simple  like  or  follow. 
In addition, there have also been various trends in the differences of uses between political parties in the United States and their usage of social media. In the 111th Congress, when Twitter was still fairly new; over half of Republican members of the House of Representatives were active on Twitter.
When it comes to citizens, according to PEW, 32% of conservatives follow their elected officials on Twitter, and 27% of Democrats follow their officials.Social media has a significant influence on political campaigns. The use of social media helps both candidates and constituents connect with one another. During the 2016 election cycle, candidates would post 5-7 times and would tweet 11-12 times a day.For candidates, Facebook brings publicity and enables them to communicate effectively to the voters. This information has become very valuable for candidates. One super Political Action Committee that was anti-Trump, spent $9.9 million dollars in digital media. For candidates, social media provides them with a platform to highlight their ideas, and curate what they would like voters to see. According to the PEW research center, 35% of users of social media have taken advantage of sites like Facebook, in getting out to vote. Therefore, it has become a valuable tool for candidates. In the 2012 reelection campaign for President Obama, the campaign used over 15 different methods of social media. This was to reach out to a broader audience. Social media provides a mechanism for candidates to directly engage with society and potential voters. In Romania, during the elections for Mayor in a town called Bacau only 3/10 candidates used Facebook in 2012. In 2016 all of the candidates engaged in the use of social media and Facebook.Social media also provided candidates with an insight into predicting the outcome of votes, which are more accurate than normal polling methods. Social media is a tool for campaigns as it provides an analysis as to the political climate, as well as the levels of engagement.For potential voters, social media is a way to get information. According to the PEW research center, 44% of the voting population surveyed used social media as a way to get information about the 2016 election. This was significantly more than print newspapers at the local and national level. Furthermore, 24% of those surveyed claimed that they directly got information about the election at the national level from the two candidates; Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton.
Technology advancement has been significantly influential in the emergence and subsequent reliability of digital rhetoric in communication. Given the affordability of electronic gadgets, such as smartphones, tablets and computers, digital rhetoric has particularly thrived globally. The 2016 US election and the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom are some of the notable instances of the influence of digital rhetoric in the political front.","Fingers,[bpoc],32.23,C0016129|Term Birth,[orgf],19.22,C0233324|Fingers,[bpoc],16.01,C0016129|Fingers,[bpoc],16.14,C0016129|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.85,C0162867|Fingers,[bpoc],528.72,C0016129|Thrombocythemia, Essential,[dsyn],19.25,C0040028|Uncertainty,[fndg],19.21,C0087130|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.99,C0162867|Fingers,[bpoc],253.84,C0016129|Gender,[orga],17.80,C0079399|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.18,C0008300|Vision,[orgf],16.15,C0042789|Comprehension,[menp],14.64,C0162340|Consultation,[hlca],14.64,C0009818|Ability,[orga],13.14,C0085732|Affect (mental function),[menp],11.49,C0001721|Tunica Media,[tisu],11.49,C0162867|sex,[orga],11.49,C1522384|Thinking, function,[menp],9.88,C0039869|Intention - mental process,[menp],9.79,C0162425|Personality Character,[menp],9.78,C0007952|Disease Management,[hlca],9.74,C0376636|Educational Status,[fndg],9.74,C0013658|Fingers,[bpoc],176.15,C0016129|Comprehension,[menp],26.50,C0162340|Educational Status,[fndg],20.39,C0013658|Tunica Media,[tisu],20.01,C0162867|Blogging,[acty],17.80,C2718045|Learning,[menp],14.64,C0023185|Attention,[menp],13.05,C0004268|Set (Psychology),[menp],13.03,C0036849|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],12.91,C0027627|Fingers,[bpoc],48.97,C0016129|Vision,[orgf],32.77,C0042789|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.18,C0008300|Convulsions,[sosy],14.64,C4048158|Seizures,[sosy],14.64,C0036572|Ability,[orga],13.05,C0085732|Neoplasm Metastasis,[neop],13.01,C0027627|Learning,[menp],12.92,C0023185|Fingers,[bpoc],253.99,C0016129|Personality Character,[menp],19.68,C0007952|Choice Behavior,[inbe],16.18,C0008300|Vision,[orgf],16.15,C0042789|Motivation,[menp],16.12,C0026605|Consultation,[hlca],14.64,C0009818|Learning,[menp],14.64,C0023185|Thinking, function,[menp],9.88,C0039869|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.74,C0162867|Attitude,[menp],6.66,C0004271|Motivation,[menp],16.12,C0026605|Fingers,[bpoc],16.08,C0016129|Learning,[menp],12.96,C0023185|Inclusion Bodies,[celc],9.87,C0007637|Fingers,[bpoc],124.77,C0016129|Tunica Media,[tisu],19.78,C0162867|Patient Discharge,[hlca],19.75,C0030685|Learning,[menp],14.64,C0023185|Attitude,[menp],13.71,C0004271|Perception,[menp],9.88,C0030971|Reproduction,[orgf],9.70,C0035150|Beak,[bpoc],7.13,C0004895|Voting,[inbe],20.51,C0042978|Vision,[orgf],17.80,C0042789|Climate,[npop],16.04,C0008946|Fingers,[bpoc],16.01,C0016129|Tunica Media,[tisu],9.73,C0162867|Fingers,[bpoc],48.96,C0016129|"

"('perilla frutescens', 'Traditional medicine, phytochemicals, and toxicity')","Various perilla varieties are used for traditional medicine in Southeast Asia. Leaves of P. frutescens var. crispa are more often used than var. frutescens in China for the supposed medicinal properties. 
Characteristic aroma-active phytochemicals in perilla leaves include hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, furans, and ketones, particularly perilla ketone, egoma ketone, and isoegoma ketone. Other compounds include perillaldehyde, limonene, linalool, beta-caryophyllene, menthol, and alpha-pinene. The crispa variety is differentiated by leaf and stem colors, which vary from green to red to purple, indicating the presence of anthocyanins.Although perilla is widely cultivated as an edible plant for humans, it is toxic to cattle and other ruminants, as well as horses. In grazing cattle, plant ketones cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, also called ""panting disease"".Contact dermatitis may occur in people handling the leaves or oil. Consumption of large amounts of seeds has resulted in anaphylaxis.","Contact Dermatitis,[dsyn],14.64,C0011616|anaphylaxis,[dsyn],13.05,C0002792|Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult,[dsyn],11.49,C0035222|Disease,[dsyn],9.99,C0012634|Cell Differentiation process,[celf],6.74,C0007589|Consumption of goods,[acty],3.55,C0009830|Fragrance (odor),[npop],3.42,C2987717|"
"('perilla frutescens', 'Use')","In Manchu cuisine, perilla leaves are used to make efen, ""steamed bun""). The perilla buns are made with glutinous sorghum or glutinous rice flour dough filled with red bean paste and wrapped with perilla leaves. The dish is related to Food Extermination Day, a traditional Manchu holiday celebrated on every 26th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. 
 In India, perilla is called silam, thoiding (Meitei), Shi (Kuki), chhawhchhi (Mizo) and bhangira in
Kumaon. Perilla seeds are roasted and ground with salt, chilis, and tomatoes to make a savoury side dish or chutney. 
In  Kumaon the seeds of Bhangira (cultivated Perilla) are eaten raw, the seed oil is used for cooking purposes, and the oil cake is consumed raw or fed to cattle. The roasted seeds are also ground to prepare a spicy chutney. The seeds and leaves of Perilla are also used for flavoring curries. Manipuri cuisine uses the ground roasted seed in a salad locally known as 'singju'. 
 In Japan, the plant is called egoma and is of limited culinary importance. It is known regionally as j nen; ""ten years"") in the Northeast regions of Japan, supposedly because it adds this many years to one's lifespan. A local preparation in Fukushima Prefecture, called shingor , consists of half-pounded non-glutinous rice patties, which are skewered, smeared with miso, blended with roasted and ground j nen seeds, and roasted over charcoal. 
 In Korean cuisine, kkaennip or perilla leaves are widely used as a herb and a vegetable. Kkaennip can be used fresh as a ssam vegetable, fresh or blanched as a namul vegetable, or pickled in soy sauce or soybean paste to make jangajji (pickle) or kimchi.
Deulkkae, the perilla seeds, are either toasted and grounded into powder called deulkkae-garu or toasted and pressed to make perilla oil. Toasted deulkkae powder is used as a spice and a condiment for guk (soup), namul (seasoned vegetable dishes), guksu (noodle dishes), kimchi, and eomuk (fishcake). It is also used as gomul (coating or topping) for desserts: Yeot and several tteok (rice cake) varieties can be coated with toasted perilla powder. Perilla oil made from toasted perilla seeds is used as a cooking oil and as a condiment.
In Korean-style western food, perilla leaves are sometimes used to substitute basil, and the seed powder and oil is used in salad dressings as well as in dipping sauces. A Michelin-starred restaurant in Seoul serves nutty vanilla ice cream whose secret ingredient is perilla oil. 
 In Nepal, perilla is called silam (     ). Perilla seeds are roasted and ground with salt, chilis, and tomatoes to make a savoury dip/side dish or chutney.","Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],17.80,C0020498|Holidays,[acty],9.94,C0019843|Paste substance,[sbst],3.56,C0030634|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.25,C0020498|Fish-Eye Disease,[dsyn],22.51,C0342895|flavor enhancers,[sbst],19.34,C0682897|Eating,[orgf],12.94,C0013470|Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,[dsyn],16.12,C0014518|Paste substance,[sbst],5.18,C0030634|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],32.65,C0020498|Hyperostosis, Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal,[dsyn],16.23,C0020498|"
