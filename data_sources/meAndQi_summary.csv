Adzuki bean,Adzuki bean,"The adzuki bean (Vigna angularis; from azuki (Japanese: アズキ（小豆）); sometimes transliterated as azuki or adzuki), or English red mung bean, is an annual vine widely cultivated throughout East Asia for its small (approximately 5 millimetres (0.20 in) long) bean.
Commonly the plant self-pollinates but cross-pollination also exists.The wild ancestor of cultivated adzuki bean is probably Vigna angularis var.
Leaflets are ovate and about 5–10 cm long and 5–8 cm wide.The adzuki bean is mainly cultivated in China (670,000 ha), Japan (60,000 ha), South Korea (25,000 ha), and Taiwan (15,000 ha) (data published 2006).
Amounts of 4 to 8 dt/ha are reported, but in Japan and China yields between 20 and 30 dt/ha are reached.The description of the adzuki bean can vary between authors because there are both wild and cultivated forms of the plant.
Pod shatter during seed ripening and harvesting might be a difficulty under certain conditions.In Japan, the adzuki bean was one of the first crops subjected to scientific plant breeding."
Agarwood,Agarwood,"Prior to infection, the heartwood is odourless, relatively light and pale coloured; however, as the infection progresses, the tree produces a dark aromatic resin, called aloes or agar (not to be confused with the edible, algae-derived agar) as well as gaharu, jinko, oud, or oodh (not to be confused with bukhoor), in response to the attack, which results in a very dense, dark, resin-embedded heartwood.
In 2004, all Aquilaria species were listed in Appendix II; however, a number of countries have outstanding reservations regarding that listing.First-grade agarwood is one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world, with 2010 prices for superior pure material as high as US$100,000/kg, although in practice adulteration of the wood and oil is common, allowing for prices as low as US$100/kg.
SandalwoodThere are seventeen species in the genus Aquilaria, large evergreens native to southeast Asia, and nine are known to produce agar wood.
In natural forests, only about 7 out of 100 Aquilaria trees of same species are infected and produce aloes/agar wood."

Soybeans were probably first cultivated in Canada by 1855, and definitely in 1895 at Ontario Agricultural College.It was not until Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Burr Osborne showed that the nutritional value of soybean seeds could be increased by cooking, moisture or heat, that soy went from a farm animal feed to a human food.William Morse is considered the ""father"" of modern soybean agriculture in America.
The soy-based meat substitute textured vegetable protein has been used for more than 50 years as a way of inexpensively extending ground beef without reducing its nutritional value.Soybeans contain a high level of phytic acid, which has many effects including acting as an antioxidant and a chelating agent."
Field thistle,Field thistle,"Cirsium arvense is a perennial species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native throughout Europe and northern Asia, and widely introduced elsewhere.
Species Profile- Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.
The leaves are very spiny, lobed, and up to 15–20 cm long and 2–3 cm broad (smaller on the upper part of the flower stem).Like other Cirsium species, the roots are edible, though rarely used, not in the least because of their propensity to induce flatulence in some people.
Growing forages such as alfalfa can help control the species as a weed by frequently cutting the alfalfa to add nutrients to the soil, the weeds also get cut, and have a harder time re-establishing themselves, which reduces the shoot density.Orellia ruficauda feeds on Canada thistle and has been reported to be the most effective biological control agent for that plant."
Flax seed,Flax seed,"Solvent-processed flaxseed oil has been used for many centuries as a drying oil in painting and varnishing.Although brown flaxseed varieties may be consumed as readily as the yellow ones, and have been for thousands of years, its better-known uses are in paints, for fiber, and for cattle feed.In 2016, world production of flax (linseed) was 2.93 million tonnes, led by Russia with 23% of the global total..
Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.Two ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.In a 100-gram serving, flaxseed contains high levels (> 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, several B vitamins, and dietary minerals."
Fleeceflower root,Fleeceflower root,"Plants that are immature or affected by mowing or other restrictions have much thinner and shorter stems than mature stands, and are not hollow.Japanese knotweed is classed as an unwanted organism in New Zealand and is established in some parts of the country.The weed can be found in 39 of the 50 United States.Persicaria capitata for another plant species called Japanese knotweed.Japanese knotweed has a large underground network of roots (rhizomes).
However, these methods have not been proven to provide reliable long-term results in completely eliminating the treated population.Digging up the rhizomes is a common solution where the land is to be developed, as this is quicker than the use of herbicides, but safe disposal of the plant material without spreading it is difficult; knotweed is classed as controlled waste in the UK, and disposal is regulated by law."
Flowering quince,Flowering quince,"Chaenomeles is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the brown-tail and the leaf-miner Bucculatrix pomifoliella.The species have become popular ornamental shrubs in parts of Europe and North America, grown in gardens both for their bright flowers and as a spiny barrier.
University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture: Flowering Quince, Japonica: Chaenomeles speciosaAlthough all quince species have flowers, gardeners in the West often refer to these species as ""flowering quince"", since Chaenomeles are grown ornamentally for their flowers, not for their fruits.
These plants have also been called ""Japanese quince"", and the name ""japonica"" (referring to C.

Recently the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed a technique for the field cultivation of Euryale.The name Euryale comes from the mythical Greek Gorgon by the same name.The plant produces starchy white seeds that are edible.
The plant is cultivated for its seeds in lowland ponds in India, China, and Japan.
Seeds are collected in the late summer and early autumn, and may be eaten raw or cooked."
Frankincense,Frankincense,"Frankincense (also known as olibanum, Hebrew: לבונה‎ [levona], Arabic: اللبان‎ al-libān or Arabic: البخور‎ al-bakhūr) is an aromatic resin used in incense and perfumes, obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia in the family Burseraceae, particularly Boswellia sacra (syn.
The word is from Old French franc encens (""high-quality incense"").There are five main species of Boswellia that produce true frankincense.

The chemistry of the essential oil is mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as alpha-pinene, Limonene, alpha-Thujene, and beta-Pinene with small amounts of diterpenoid components being the upper limit in terms of molecular weight.Frankincense is tapped from the scraggly but hardy trees by striping (slashing the bark) and letting the exuded resin bleed out and harden.
Several species and varieties of frankincense trees each produce a slightly different type of resin."
Fresh ginger,Fresh ginger,"The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste.The characteristic fragrance and flavor of ginger result from volatile oils that compose 1-3% of the weight of fresh ginger, primarily consisting of zingerone, shogaols, and gingerols with [6]-gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5-hydroxy-3-decanone) as the major pungent compound.
Shagoals are more pungent and have higher antioxidant activity but not found in raw ginger, but is formed from gingerols during heating, storage or via acidity.Fresh ginger also contains an enzyme zingibain which is a cysteine protease and has similar properties to rennet.Domesticated plants and animals of AustronesiaIn 2016, global production of ginger was 3.3 million tonnes, led by India with 34% of the world total.
The juice from ginger roots is often used as a seasoning in Indian recipes and is a common ingredient of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and many South Asian cuisines for flavoring dishes such as seafood, meat, and vegetarian dishes.

Ginkgo leaf,Ginkgo leaf,"While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain.
Ginkgo, therefore, presents an ""ecological paradox"" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity).Carl Linnaeus described the species in 1771, the specific epithet biloba derived from the Latin bis, ""two"" and loba, ""lobed"", referring to the shape of the leaves."

Glossy privet fruit,Glossy privet fruit,"The genus contains about 50 species of erect, deciduous or evergreen shrubs, sometimes forming small or medium-sized trees, native to Europe, north Africa, Asia, many introduced and naturalised in Australasia, where only one species extends as a native into Queensland.
Privet was originally the name for the European semi-evergreen shrub Ligustrum vulgare, and later also for the more reliably evergreen Ligustrum ovalifolium used extensively for privacy hedging, though now the name is applied to all members of the genus.
In the German translation, they live on Liguster Weg.Privet is a group of shrubs and small trees of southern and eastern Asia, from the Himalayas extending into Australia.
The tree species, especially Chinese privet is frequently used as a street tree in Europe, while other species including Ligustrum japonicum and Ligustrum quihoui are among the others also sometimes used as ornamental plants in gardens."
Goji berry,Goji berry,"The plant parts are called by the Latin names  lycii fructus (fruit), herba lycii (leaves), etc., in modern official pharmacopeias.Since about 2000, goji berry and derived products became common in developed countries as health foods or alternative medicine remedies, extending from exaggerated and unproven claims about their health benefits.Young wolfberry shoots and leaves are harvested commercially as a leaf vegetable.Since the early 21st century, the dried fruit has been marketed in the Western world as a health food, with unsupported health claims about its benefits.
There have been also commercial products of whole and ground wolfberry seeds, and seed oil.Lycium barbarum had been introduced in the United Kingdom in the 1730s by The Duke of Argyll, but the plant was mostly used for hedges and decorative gardening.The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) had initially placed goji berry in the Novel Foods list."
Gold coin herb,Gold coin herb,"The face value is minted on the coin, and it is done so in order to bestow legal tender status on a coin, which generally makes it easier to import or export across national borders, as well as subject to laws against counterfeiting.
Larger units such as the various talent measures (26 to up to 60 kg) were used for high value exchanges (similar to today's 400-troy-ounce (12.4 kg) ""good delivery"" gold bullion bar).The rationale for biting a coin was the supposed widespread dissemination of gold plated lead coins in the 19th century.

Greater burdock fruit,Greater burdock fruit,"A bur (also spelled burr) is a seed or dry fruit or infructescence that has hooks or teeth.
Bur-bearing plants such as Xanthium species are often single-stemmed when growing in dense groups, but branch and spread when growing singly.Chisholm, Hugh, ed.
The hooks or teeth generally cause irritation, and some species commonly cause gross injury to animals, or expensive damage to clothing or to vehicle tires.
Burs serve the plants that bear them in two main ways.
Several species of Tribulus, Harpagophytum, and Grielum produce fruit in the form of trample-burs.
They may hook onto the legs of animals as the large hooks of Harpagophytum do, sometimes causing serious injury, but sometimes hooking onto the leg of say, an ostrich, apparently without causing discomfort.
The bur of burdock was the inspiration for hook and loop fastener, also known as Velcro.Common bur-bearing plants include:
Geum aleppicum (yellow avens)
Geum canadense (white avens)"
Gypsum,Gypsum,"The Mohs scale of mineral hardness defines hardness value 2 as gypsum based on scratch hardness comparison.Gypsum occurs in nature as flattened and often twinned crystals, and transparent, cleavable masses called selenite.
Upon addition of water, after a few tens of minutes plaster of Paris becomes regular gypsum (dihydrate) again, causing the material to harden or ""set"" in ways that are useful for casting and construction.
When gypsum is heated in air it loses water and converts first to calcium sulfate hemihydrate, (bassanite, often simply called ""plaster"") and, if heated further, to anhydrous calcium sulfate (anhydrite).
As for anhydrite, its solubility in saline solutions and in brines is also strongly dependent on NaCl (common table salt) concentration.Gypsum crystals are found to contain anion water and hydrogen bonding.Gypsum is a common mineral, with thick and extensive evaporite beds in association with sedimentary rocks."
Hawthorn berry,Hawthorn berry,"Crataegus (), commonly called hawthorn, quickthorn, thornapple, May-tree, whitethorn, or hawberry, is a genus of several hundred species of shrubs and trees in the family Rosaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, Asia and North America.
It is graft-compatible with Mespilus (medlar), and with pear, and makes a hardier rootstock than quince, but the thorny suckering habit of the hawthorn can be problematic.Seedlings of Crataegus monogyna have been used to graft multiple species on the same trunk, such as pink hawthorn, pear tree, and medlar, the result being trees which give pink and white flowers in May and fruits during the summer.
Other species (especially Crataegus laevigata) are used in herbal medicine where the plant is believed to strengthen cardiovascular function.The Kutenai people of northwestern North America used black hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: kaǂa; approximate pronunciation: kasha) for food, and red hawthorn fruit (Kutenai language: ǂupǂi; approximate pronunciation: shupshi) in traditional medicine.Overdose can cause cardiac arrhythmia and low blood pressure, while milder side effects include nausea and dizziness."

Hemp seed,Hemp seed,"It can be refined into a variety of commercial items, including paper, textiles, clothing, biodegradable plastics, paint, insulation, biofuel, food, and animal feed.Although cannabis as a drug and industrial hemp both derive from the species Cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), they are distinct strains with unique phytochemical compositions and uses.
Since its inception in 1931, the Hemp Breeding Department at the Institute of Bast Crops in Hlukhiv (Glukhov), Ukraine, has been one of the world's largest centers for developing new hemp varieties, focusing on improving fiber quality, per-hectare yields, and low THC content.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the commercial cultivation of hemp declined sharply.
In 2010/2011, a total of 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) was cultivated with hemp in the EU, a decline compared with previous year.In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.3% THC and are unsuitable for producing hashish and marijuana."
Honey,Honey,"Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own, which may be due to other ingredients it contains.Fermentation of honey usually occurs after crystallization, because without the glucose, the liquid portion of the honey primarily consists of a concentrated mixture of fructose, acids, and water, providing the yeast with enough of an increase in the water percentage for growth.
Evidence does not support the use of honey-based products for the treatment of venous stasis ulcers or ingrown toenail.Individual honeys from different plant sources contain over 100 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play a primary role in determining honey flavors and aromas.
The specific composition, color, aroma, and flavor of any batch of honey depend on the flowers foraged by bees that produced the honey.One 1980 study found that mixed floral honey from several United States regions typically contains:"
Honeycomb,Honeycomb,"A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal prismatic wax cells built by honey bees in their nests to contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen.
If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern.
Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.
Numerous wasps, especially Polistinae and Vespinae, construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; in some species (such as Brachygastra mellifica), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb.
The cells slope slightly upwards, between 9 and 14°, towards the open ends.Two possible explanations exist as to why honeycomb is composed of hexagons, rather than any other shape."
Honeysuckle flower,Honeysuckle flower,"L. japonica is an aggressive, highly invasive species considered as a significant pest on the continents of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants.
The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.Honeysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties.
L. japonica was introduced in Australia between 1820-40.Several species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.
Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.Most species of Lonicera are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit.
This nocturnal species of moth is primarily attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.Some 180 species of Lonicera are documented."

Japanese thistle,Japanese thistle,"Cirsium is a genus of perennial and biennial flowering plants in the Asteraceae, one of several genera known commonly as thistles.
Cirsium thistles are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species - see list of Lepidoptera that feed on Cirsium.
Some species in particular are cultivated in gardens and wildflower plantings for their aesthetic value and/or to support pollinators such as butterflies.
Cirsium vulgare, for instance, ranked in the top 10 for nectar production in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative.
A great many native North American plants have weed in their common names, despite their beneficial qualities, such as Asclepias tuberosa, commonly known as butterflyweed.
Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, non-native thistles, such as Cirsium vulgare in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife."

Kombu,Kombu,"Kombu (from Japanese: 昆布, romanized: konbu) is edible kelp from mostly the family Laminariaceae and is widely eaten in East Asia.
Zhang Yuxi referred to haidai in the book 嘉祐補註神農本草 (1060).Although archaeological evidence of seaweed is hard to find because of its easy decomposition, some plant remains of wakame seaweed are found in some ruins of the Jōmon Period which leads to the supposition that kombu was also eaten at that time.
The difficulty is that, at least in that time, kombu was not produced either in the East nor in the South China Sea.
Kompu in Ainu quite resembles gūanbù or kūnbù in Chinese, and it is possible to speculate that one is a loanword from the other.There are about eighteen edible species in Laminariaceae and most of them, but not all, are called kombu.

Longan,Longan,"Dimocarpus longan, commonly known as the longan (), is a tropical tree species that produces edible fruit.
It is native to Southern Asia.The longan (from Cantonese lùhng-ngáahn 龍眼, literally 'dragon eye'), is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris).
Currently, longan crops are grown in southern China, Taiwan, northern Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Australia, the United States, and  Mauritius.
In contrast with the fresh fruit, which is juicy and white, the flesh of dried longans is dark brown to almost black.Longan is commonly found in traditional Eastern folk medicine.
The flesh has a musky, sweet taste, which can be compared to the flavor of lychee fruit.The Longan tree is somewhat sensitive to frost."

Since the perfume-like flavour is lost in the process of canning, the fruit is usually eaten fresh.Cultivation of lychee began in the region of southern China, going back to 1059 AD, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam."
Malt,Malt,"The grain is made to germinate by soaking in water and is then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.Malting grain develops the enzymes (α-amylase, β-amylase) required for modifying the grains' starches into various types of sugar, including monosaccharide glucose, disaccharide maltose, trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines.
The drying step stops the sprouting, but the enzymes remain active due to the low temperatures used in base malt production.
Brewers warm cracked malt in temperature-modulated water, activating the enzymes, which cleave more of the malt's remaining starch into various sugars, the largest percentage of which is maltose.
The LME may be further dried to produce dry malt extract (DME), which is crystalline in form similar to common sugar.

In 15th century Europe, motherwort was considered by some herbalists to protect against evil spirits.Leonurus cardiaca has a squarish stem which is clad in short hairs and is often purplish, especially near the nodes.
Flowers appear in leaf axils on the upper part of the plant and have three-lobed bracts.
The calyx of each flower is bell-shaped and has five lobes.
The upper lip is convex and covered with white hairs and the lower lip is three-lobed and downward-curving and spotted with red."
Mudan peony bark,Paeonia suffruticosa,"Paeonia suffruticosa is a name used for a group of culture varieties of tree peonies that are the result of hybridisation with species exclusively belonging to the subsection Vaginatae.
Plants belonging to this group have been cultivated for millennia in China, initially only as a source of traditional Chinese medicine particularly the skin of its roots (牡丹皮; mǔdān pí).
This is associated with tree peony yellows disease in China.Paeonia suffruticosa has a long history of being used in Chinese medicine.
Paeonia decomposita is the only species from the Vaginatae that has not contributed to these cultivars.Paeonia suffruticosa, also known as the tree peony, originates from China.
suffruticosa cultivars by Victor Lemoine in Nancy has led to the introduction of the color yellow into the cultivated double-flowered tree-peonies.
Some of the early Itoh cultivars are ‘Yellow Crown’, ‘Yellow Dream’, ‘Yellow Emperor’ and ‘Yellow Heaven’.Cultivated hybrid tree peonies originate from China and its surrounding areas, possessing significant cultural meaning throughout Chinese history."
Mulberry Fruit,Mulberry Fruit,"The paper was used to make books, known as kraing.In a 100g (3.5oz) serving, raw mulberries provide 180 kJ (43 kcal), 44% of the daily value (DV) for vitamin C, and 14% of the DV for iron; other nutrients are in insignificant quantity (see table).Black, red, and white mulberries are widespread in Southern Europe, the Middle East, northern Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, where the tree and the fruit have names under regional dialects.
However, any new growth from below the graft(s) must be removed, as they would be from the original male mulberry tree.The fruit of the white mulberry – an East Asian species extensively naturalized in urban regions of eastern North America – has a different flavor, sometimes characterized as refreshing and a little tart, with a bit of gumminess to it and a hint of vanilla."
Mulberry bark,Paper mulberry,"Seed dispersal is accomplished by animals that eat the fruits, and the plants can form wide, dense stands via their spreading root systems.This is considered to be one of the worst weeds in Pakistan, one of the most significant invasive plants on the Pampas in Argentina, and a dominant invasive in the forests of Uganda.The pollen is allergenic.
It grows well in many climate types.This plant has been cultivated in Asia and some Pacific Islands for many centuries for food, fiber, and medicine.Paper mulberry was used among ancient Austronesians in making barkcloth.
If the feral plants reproduced sexually is unknown, as the plants are dioecious and require both male and female specimens to be present in one island.Paper mulberry is primarily used in the Pacific Islands to make barkcloth (tapa in most Polynesian languages).
Other terms widely used for barkcloth and paper mulberry are derived from the Proto-Polynesian reconstructed word *siapo, with cognates including Niue, Tongan, and Marquesan hiapo; and Samoan and East Futunan siapo."

Ningpo figwort root,Ningpo figwort root,"Scrophularia ningpoensis, commonly known as the Ningpo figwort or Chinese figwort, is a perennial plant of the family Scrophulariaceae (the figwort family). It reaches 1 m by 0.4 m. Its flowers are hermaphrodite, insect-pollinated and the plant usually flowers in late spring.
This plant has been known to traditional Chinese medicine for as long as 2000 years. Its root is harvested in autumn in Zhejiang province and neighboring areas, then dried for later use."
Notopterygium root,Notopterygium root,"While this was in an incubated setting, it is generally acceptable to assume that natural conditions are at least somewhat similar.In a study of both the roots and rhizome, it was found that they have a total of 24 different compounds.
Phenethyl ferulate, which is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor in vitro.Flowers of Notopterygium incisum, as mentioned above are located in very dense umbellues and can be described as ""many flowered.""   The petals are white/greenish-white, in ovate/oblong-ovate shape that are 1.5 by 1mm in size.
Flowering takes place from July to August while fruits follow in the months of August to September.Notopterygium incisum grows naturally in the provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Xizang, China.
The rhizome portion which grows as a horizontal stem underground gives rise to new roots, and also shoots which eventually produce stems and then flowers."
Nutmeg,Nutmeg,"In Kerala Malabar region of India, it is used for juice, pickles and chutney.In low doses, nutmeg produces no noticeable physiological or neurological response, but in large doses, both raw nutmeg freshly ground from kernels, as well as nutmeg oil, have psychoactive effects, which appear to derive from anticholinergic-like hallucinogenic mechanisms attributed to myristicin and elemicin.
Ground nutmeg is also smoked in India.In traditional European cuisine, nutmeg and mace are used especially in potato dishes and in processed meat products; they are also used in soups, sauces, and baked goods.
It is also cultivated on Penang Island in Malaysia, in the Caribbean, especially in Grenada, and in Kerala, a state formerly known as Malabar in ancient writings as the hub of spice trading, in southern India."
Oyster shell,Oyster shell,"Windowpane oysters are harvested for their translucent shells, which are used to make various kinds of decorative objects.Bivalves, including oysters, are effective filter feeders and can have large effects on the water columns in which they occur.
For example, non-native species in Tomales Bay have resulted in the loss of half of California's Olympia oysters.In October 2017, it was reported that underwater noise pollution can affect oysters as they close their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions.
The largest oyster-producing body of water in the United States is Chesapeake Bay, although these beds have decreased in number due to overfishing and pollution.
The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters.
Open oysters should be tapped on the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat."
Pagoda tree flower,Pagoda tree flower,"Styphnolobium japonicum (L.) Schott, the Japanese pagoda tree (Chinese scholar tree, pagoda tree; syn.
Sophora japonica) is a species of tree in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae.
The leaves are alternate, pinnate, with 9–21 leaflets, and the flowers in pendulous racemes similar to those of the Black locust.The Guilty Chinese Scholartree was a historic pagoda tree in Beijing, from which the last emperor of the Ming dynasty, Chongzhen, hanged himself.The dried flower buds may contain as much as 20% rutin with some quercetin.
It grows into a lofty tree 10–20 m tall with an equal spread, and produces a fine, dark brown timber.S. japonicum (Chinese: 槐; pinyin: huái; formerly Sophora japonica) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.The flowers and leaves are sometimes used for teas, such as by families in Laoshan Village, Shandong Province, China."
Peach kernel,Peach kernel,"The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated.
In walled gardens constructed from stone or brick, which absorb and retain solar heat and then slowly release it, raising the temperature against the wall, peaches can be grown as espaliers against south-facing walls as far north as southeast Great Britain and southern Ireland.Peaches grow in a fairly limited range in dry, continental or temperate climates, since the trees have a chilling requirement that tropical or subtropical areas generally do not satisfy except at high altitudes (for example in certain areas of Ecuador, Colombia, Ethiopia, India, and Nepal).
Peaches are climacteric fruits and continue to ripen after being picked from the tree.In 2016, world production of peaches and nectarines was 25 million tonnes, led by China which produced 58% of the world total (table)."
Pearl,Pearl,"Although these may also be legitimately referred to as ""pearls"" by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules, and are formed in the same way, most of them have no value except as curiosities.All shelled mollusks can, by natural processes, produce some kind of ""pearl"" when an irritating microscopic object becomes trapped within its mantle folds, but the great majority of these ""pearls"" are not valued as gemstones.
These pearls are then processed (often simply matched and sorted), relabeled as product of Japan, and exported.In the past two decades, cultured pearls have been produced using larger oysters in the south Pacific and Indian Ocean.
Tahitian pearls, frequently referred to as black pearls, are highly valued because of their rarity; the culturing process for them dictates a smaller volume output and they can never be mass-produced because, in common with most sea pearls, the oyster can only be nucleated with one pearl at a time, while freshwater mussels are capable of multiple pearl implants."
Perennial buckwheat root,Perennial buckwheat root,"Koenigia alaskana (synonym Aconogonon alaskanum) is an Asian and North American species of flowering plants in the buckwheat family known by the common name Alaska wild-rhubarb.Koenigia alaskana is a perennial herb up to 200 centimeters (almost 7 feet) tall, with a woody root. Flowers are white or pale green, borne in elongated arrays.Koenigia alaskana is native to Alaska, the Yukon, and Magadan Oblast in the Russian Far East."
Perilla leaf,Perilla leaf,"Perilla is a genus consisting of one major Asiatic crop species Perilla frutescens and a few wild species in nature belonging to the mint family, Lamiaceae.
The genus encompasses several distinct varieties of Asian herb, seed, and vegetable crop, including P.
= Elsholtzia ciliata (Thunb.) Hyl.The classification of Perilla is confused, partly because botanists struggled with distinguishing the two distinct cultigens as different species or variations.
crispa was regarded as a species in its own right, distinct from P.
An early example of dividing the two cultigens into different species is found in Matsumura's 1884 nomenclature book, where the synonym P.
crispa, especially by the Japanese, therefore it should not be considered an interchangeable synonym for either cultigen.
hirtella – also called lemon perillaPossible Perilla species with insufficient description and without known herbarium specimens include:
crispa.Perilla varieties are cultivated and consumed mainly in Korea, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam."
Perilla seed,Perilla seed,"Various perilla varieties are traditionally used by local people, the leaves are used as a vegetable and the seeds supply nutritious cooking oil.
In the United States, perilla is a weed pest, toxic to cattle after ingestion.The plant was introduced into Korea before the Unified Silla era, when it started to be widely cultivated.In its natural state, the yield of perilla leaves and seeds is not high.
Manipuri cuisine uses the ground roasted seed in a salad locally known as 'singju'.Having a distinctive nutty aroma and taste, the oil pressed from the toasted perilla seeds is used as a flavor enhancer, condiment, and a cooking oil in Korean cuisine.
A local preparation in Fukushima Prefecture, called shingorō, consists of half-pounded non-glutinous rice patties, which are skewered, smeared with miso, blended with roasted and ground jūnen seeds, and roasted over charcoal.In Korean cuisine, kkaennip or perilla leaves are widely used as a herb and a vegetable."
Plantain seed,Plantago,"Plantago is a genus of about 200 species of small, inconspicuous plants commonly called plantains or fleaworts.
Edibility of Plantago: Visual identification and edible parts of wild plantago.Plantains are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth)—see list of Lepidoptera that feed on plantains.The leaves are sessile, but have a narrow part near the stem which is a pseudo-petiole.
P. psyllium seed is useful for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, dietary fiber supplementation, and diverticular disease.
For example, archaeological recovery along California's Central Coast has demonstrated use of this species as a food since the Millingstone Horizon.Psyllium supplements are typically used in powder form, along with adequate amounts of fluids.
The genus name Plantago descends from the classical Latin name plantago, which in classical Latin meant some Plantago species, including Plantago major and Plantago media.
The name was so formed in Latin because the leaves of these species grow out near flat at ground level."
Platycodon root,Platycodon root,"Platycodon grandiflorus (from Ancient Greek πλατύς ""wide"" and κώδων ""bell"") is a species of herbaceous flowering perennial plant of the family Campanulaceae, and the only member of the genus Platycodon.
It is commonly known as balloon flower (referring to the balloon-shaped flower buds), Chinese bellflower, or platycodon.This plant is hardy down to −15 °C (5 °F), and can therefore be cultivated in all temperate zones.
It lives throughout Japan, China, and eastern Siberia, including the Korean Peninsula.Platycodon grandiflorus at RobsplantsGrowing to 60 cm (24 in) tall by 30 cm (12 in) wide, it is an herbaceous perennial with dark green leaves and blue flowers in late summer.
In addition, the ""Bellflower Seal"" (桔梗紋, kikyōmon) is the crest (kamon) of some clans.In Korea, the plant as well as its root are referred to as doraji (도라지)."
Plum flowers,Plum flowers,"The commercially important plum trees are medium-sized, usually pruned to 5–6 metres height.
If the weather is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, and if it is unseasonably wet or if the plums are not harvested as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called brown rot.
Prunus (Old World plums) – leaves in bud rolled inwards; flowers 1-3 together; fruit smooth, often wax-bloomed
Prunocerasus (New World plums) – leaves in bud folded inwards; flowers 3–5 together; fruit smooth, often wax-bloomed
In certain parts of the world, some fruits are called plums and are quite different from fruits known as plums in Europe or the Americas.
In South Asia and Southeast Asia, jambul, a fruit from tropical tree in family Myrtaceae, is similarly sometimes referred to 'damson plums', and it is different from damson plums found in Europe and Americas."

Prepared rehmannia,Prepared rehmannia,"It was traditionally made from the powdered plastron (bottom shell) from the  turtle Cuora trifasciata (commonly known as ""three-lined box turtle"", or ""golden coin turtle"", 金錢龜) and a variety of herbal products, in particular, China roots Smilax glabra (土伏苓, Tu fu ling).
Although the golden coin turtle  (Cuora trifasciata) is commercially farmed in modern China, it is extremely expensive; therefore, even when turtle-derived ingredients are used in commercially available guīlínggāo, they come from other, more commonly available, turtle species.More often, commercially available guīlínggāo sold as a dessert does not contain turtle shell powder.
on PubMedTraditional guilinggao recipes require boiling turtle shell for many hours, first by itself, then with a variety of herbal ingredients, so that the liquid is gradually evaporated and a jelly-like residue forms.
Rice flour and corn starch is added to thicken the product.The ingredients of traditional guilinggao consists of:"
Propolis,Propolis,"Normally, it is dark brown in color, but it can be found in green, red, black, and white hues, depending on the sources of resin found in the particular hive area.
Honey bees are opportunists, gathering what they need from available sources, and detailed analyses show that the chemical composition of propolis varies considerably from region to region, along with the vegetation.
Propolis also contains persistent lipophilic acaricides, a natural pesticide that deters mite infestations.In neotropical regions, in addition to a large variety of trees, bees may also gather resin from flowers in the genera Clusia and Dalechampia, which are the only known plant genera that produce floral resins to attract pollinators.
Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is also a component of some varieties of propolis from New Zealand.Occasionally, worker bees will even gather various caulking compounds of human manufacture, when the usual sources are more difficult to obtain."

The 'München Bier' variety supplies seed pods that are sometimes served raw as an accompaniment to beer in Germany.Broadly speaking, radishes can be categorized into four main types according to the seasons when they are grown and a variety of shapes lengths, colors, and sizes, such as red, pink, white, gray-black, or yellow radishes, with round or elongated roots that can grow longer than a parsnip.Sometimes referred to as European radishes or spring radishes if they are planted in cooler weather, summer radishes are generally small and have a relatively short three- to four-week cultivation time."
Red peony root,Red peony root,"The peony or paeony is a flowering plant in the genus Paeonia, the only genus in the family Paeoniaceae.
About half of the species of the section Paeonia however is tetraploid (4n=20), particularly many of those in the Mediterranean region.
Both allotetraploids and autotetraploids are known, and some diploid species are also of hybrid origin.The family name ""Paeoniaceae"" was first used by Friedrich K.L. Rudolphi in 1830, following a suggestion by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling that same year.
P. suffruticosa is a cultivated hybrid swarm, not a naturally occurring species.The remainder of the species belongs to the section Paeonia, which is characterised by a complicated reticulate evolution.

Roselle is used in Nigeria to make a refreshing drink known as Zobo and natural fruit juices of pineapple and watermelon are added.
Ginger is also sometimes added to the refreshing drink.With the advent in the U.S. of interest in south-of-the-border cuisine, the calyces are sold in bags usually labeled ""flor de Jamaica"" and have long been available in health food stores in the U.S. for making tea.
In the Khasi Hills of Meghalaya, the plant is locally known as jajew, and the leaves are used in local cuisine, cooked with both dried and fresh fish."
Safflower,Safflower,"In coloring textiles, dried safflower flowers are used as a natural dye source for the orange-red pigment carthamin.
""The explanation is that there are two parts of the plant which can be used; the pale seeds and the red florets.""The early Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande in New Mexico used safflower as a substitute for saffron in traditional recipes.
Other significant producers were Mexico and Kazakhstan.Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available.
For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds.In Japan, dyers have mastered the technique of producing a bright red to orange-red dye (known as carthamin) from the dried florets of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius)."
Saffron,Saffron,"Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.The domesticated saffron crocus, Crocus sativus, is an autumn-flowering perennial plant unknown in the wild.
The ""Aquila"" saffron, or zafferano dell'Aquila, is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's Abruzzo region, near L'Aquila.
In addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.
The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron.
On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed."
Saposhnikovia root,Saposhnikovia root,"The plant is still frequently referenced under the obsolete genus name Ledebouriella in many online sources devoted to traditional Chinese medicine.Saposhnikovia divaricata is found, in China, in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.
Flowering August–September and fruiting September–October.The roots and seeds of Saposhnikovia divaricata contain a variety of phytochemicals under basic research,  including furocoumarins, furanochromones, polyacetylenes, hyperosides and terpenes.

The tuberous rootstocks are harvested in early spring or late autumn (when the plants have yet to flower or have finished flowering) washed, trimmed of basal leaves and fibrous roots, sun-dried until they contain 20% moisture, shredded and then sun-dried again until completely desiccated and ready for storage."
Sargassum,Sargassum,"Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species.
The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of Sargassum.Sargassum muticum is a large brown seaweed of the class Phaeophyceae.
Sea turtlesSargassum is commonly found in the beach drift near Sargassum beds, where they are also known as gulfweed, a term that also can mean all seaweed species washed up on shore.
Many have a rough, sticky texture that, along with a robust but flexible body, helps it withstand strong water currents.In summer 2015, large quantities of different species of Sargassum accumulated along the shores of many of the countries on the Caribbean Sea. Some of the affected islands and regions include the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago."
Scallion,Scallion,"Scallions (also known as green onions, spring onions, or salad onions) are vegetables of various Allium onion species.
The leaves are often chopped into other dishes, in the manner of onions or garlic.Spring onions may be cooked or used raw as a part of salads, salsas or Asian recipes.
The leaves are chopped and lightly cooked, then emulsified in oil that is then used as a garnish.Species and cultivars that may be called ""scallions"" include:
cepa (common onion) are from a young plant, harvested before a bulb forms or sometimes after slight bulbing has occurred.
A. fistulosum, the Welsh onion – does not form bulbs even when mature, and is grown in the West almost exclusively as a scallion or salad onion, although in Asia this species is of primary importance and used both fresh and cooked."
Schisandra berry,Schisandra berry,"Schisandra chinensis (common name: magnolia-vine, Chinese magnolia-vine, schisandra), whose fruit is called magnolia berry or five-flavor-fruit (from Chinese wǔ wèi zi), is a deciduous woody vine native to forests of Northern China and the Russian Far East.
The species itself is dioecious, thus flowers on a female plant will only produce fruit when fertilized with pollen from a male plant.
Sometimes, it is more specifically called běi wǔ wèi zi (literally ""northern five-flavor berry"") to distinguish it from another traditionally medicinal schisandraceous plant Kadsura japonica that grows only in subtropical areas.
Another species of schisandra berry, Schisandra sphenanthera, has a similar but different biochemical profile;  the Chinese Pharmacopeia distinguishes between S.
sphenanthera (nan wǔ wèi zi).Schisandra is native to northern and northeastern China (Manchuria).
In order to successfully grow fruit male and female plants must be grown together."
Sea buckthorn fruit,Sea buckthorn fruit,"Hippophae rhamnoides, also known as sea-buckthorn is a species of flowering plant in the family Elaeagnaceae, native to the cold-temperate regions of Europe and Asia.
The plant is used in the food and cosmetics industries, in traditional medicine, as animal fodder, and for ecological purposes.H. rhamnoides needs a period of 4 to 5 years from the appearance of the first shoots from the seeds to the beginning of fruit and peaks at the 7–8th year of plant life, remaining productive for 30 years with intermittent pruning.
Similarly inappropriate are clayey soils, with high density and water retention characteristics.H. rhamnoides is considered drought resistant but it is a moisture sensitive plant especially in the spring when plants are flowering and young fruits are beginning to develop.
rhamnoides that were relatively resistant to wilt disease have also been identified.Sea buckthorn fruit contains sugars, sugar alcohols, fruit acids, vitamins (C, E, and K), polyphenols, carotenoids, fiber, amino acids, minerals, and plant sterols."
Sharp-leaf galangal fruit,Sharp-leaf galangal fruit,"It can be used whole, or as dried and ground.In Indian and Pakistani cuisine, bay laurel leaves are sometimes used in place of Indian bay leaf, although they have a different flavour.
Thai and Laotian cuisine employs bay leaf (Thai name bai kra wan) in a few Arab-influenced dishes, notably massaman curry.Bay leaves can also be crushed or ground before cooking.
It also is unclear to what extent the alleged effect of cyanide released by the crushed leaves has been mis-attributed to Laurus nobilis in confusion with the unrelated Prunus laurocerasus, the so-called cherry laurel, which certainly does contain dangerous concentrations of cyanogenic glycocides together with the enzymes to generate the hydrogen cyanide from the glycocides if the leaf is physically damaged.The Canadian government requires that the bay leaves contain no more than 4.5% total ash material with a maximum of 0.5% of which is insoluble in hydrochloric acid.
Fresh or dried bay leaves are used in cooking for their distinctive flavour and fragrance."

Sichuan pepper,Sichuan pepper,"It is commonly used in Sichuanese dishes such as mapo doufu and Chongqing hot pot, and is often added together with chili peppers to create a flavor known in Mandarin as málà (麻辣; ""numb-spiciness"").
Ma la sauce (Chinese: 麻辣; pinyin: málà; literally ""numbing and spicy""), common in Sichuan cooking, is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper, and it is a key ingredient in má là hot pot, the Sichuan version of the traditional Chinese dish.
The recipe may include ginger oil and brown sugar cooked with a base of noodles and vegetables, then adding rice vinegar and Sichuan pepper oil after cooking.Hua jiao yan (simplified Chinese: 花椒盐; traditional Chinese: 花椒鹽; pinyin: huājiāoyán) is a mixture of salt and Sichuan pepper, toasted and browned in a wok, and served as a condiment to accompany chicken, duck, and pork dishes."
Silvery wormwood leaf,Artemisia argyi,"Artemisia argyi, commonly known as silvery wormwood or Chinese mugwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant with a creeping rhizome.
It is a common flavoring and colorant in the Chinese dish qīng tuán (青团).Wormwood leaves are gathered on a warm dry day in spring and summer when the plant is in flower and dried in the shade.
The leaves have an antibacterial action and have been shown to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus,  Bacillus dysenteriae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas.The fine fibers of the plant have been used as a binding agent for the seal stamping paste.
The plants do better and are more aromatic when they grow on poor dry soil.Artemisia argyi is an upright, greyish, herbaceous perennial about one metre tall, with short branches and a creeping rhizome.
argyi flowers and it is suggested that therapeutic use of the flowers may be just as effective as using the leaves."
Smilax glabra root,Smilax glabra root,"Root beer is a sweet North American beverage traditionally made using the root bark of the sassafras tree Sassafras albidum or the vine of Smilax ornata (sarsaparilla) as the primary flavor.
Modern, commercially produced root beer is generally sweet, foamy, carbonated, non-alcoholic, and flavored using artificial sassafras flavoring.
Common flavorings are vanilla, wintergreen, black cherry bark, licorice root, sarsaparilla root, nutmeg, acacia, anise, molasses, cinnamon, sweet birch, and honey.
Soybean protein is sometimes used to create a foamy quality, and caramel coloring is used to make the beverage brown.Ingredients in early and traditional root beers include allspice, birch bark, coriander, juniper, ginger, wintergreen, hops, burdock root, dandelion root, spikenard, pipsissewa, guaiacum chips, sarsaparilla, spicewood, wild cherry bark, yellow dock, prickly ash bark, sassafras root, vanilla beans, dog grass, molasses, and licorice.

Snow ear mushroom,Snow ear mushroom,"Tremella fuciformis is a species of fungus; it produces white, frond-like, gelatinous basidiocarps (fruiting bodies).
Tremella fuciformis is commonly known as snow fungus, snow ear, silver ear fungus, and white jelly mushroom.Tremella fuciformis is a parasitic yeast, and grows as a slimy, mucous-like film until it encounters its preferred hosts, various species of Annulohypoxylon (or possibly Hypoxylon) fungi, whereupon it then invades, triggering the aggressive mycelial growth required to form the fruiting bodies.Tremella fuciformis has been cultivated in China since at least the nineteenth century.
In Vietnamese cuisine, it's often used in Chè (Vietnamese pronunciation: [cɛ̂]), a Vietnamese term that refers to any traditional Vietnamese sweet beverage, dessert soup or pudding.Tremella fuciformis extract is used in women's beauty products from China, Korea, and Japan.Fruit bodies are gelatinous, watery white, up to 7.5 cm (3.0 in) across (larger in cultivated specimens), and composed of thin but erect, seaweed-like, branching fronds, often crisped at the edges."
Snow lotus,Snow lotus,"Plants for a Future.A number of the high alpine Himalayan species are grown as ornamental plants for their decorative dense woolly flowerheads; they are among the most challenging plants to grow, being adapted to harsh climates from 3500–5000 m altitude, demanding cool temperatures, a very long (up to 8–10 months) winter rest period, and very good soil drainage in humus-rich gravel soils.Saussurea lappa and has been shown to inhibit the mRNA expression of iNOS by lipopolysaccharide stimulated macrophages, thus reducing nitric oxide production.
Generally the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of the plant are much inferior to those of indometacin.Costi amari radix or costus root was an important item of Roman trade with India, and is believed to have been the dried root of Saussurea lappa.Several varieties of snow lotus are used in traditional Tibetan medicine.
Saussurea laniceps , Saussurea involucrata and Saussurea medusa flowers and stems have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, cough with cold, stomachache, dysmenorrhea, and altitude sickness, and has been found to have antiinflammatory and analgesic effects, as well as cardiotonic, abortifacient, anticancer, and antifatigue actions."
Sophora root,Sophora root,"Sophora is a genus of about 45 species of small trees and shrubs in the pea family Fabaceae.
The species are native to southeast Europe, southern Asia, Australasia, various Pacific islands, western South America, the western United States, Florida and Puerto Rico.
The generic name is derived from sophera, an Arabic name for a pea-flowered tree.The genus formerly had a broader interpretation including many other species now treated in other genera, notably Styphnolobium (pagoda tree genus), which differs in lacking nitrogen fixing bacteria (rhizobia) on the roots, and Dermatophyllum (the mescalbeans).
Styphnolobium has galactomannans as seed polysaccharide reserve, in contrast Sophora contains arabinogalactans, and Dermatophyllum amylose.

Sponge gourd,Sponge gourd,"Luffa cylindrica, the sponge gourd, Egyptian cucumber, or Vietnamese luffa,  is a species of Luffa cultivated for its fruit.
The plant is an annual vine, native to South Asia and Southeast Asia.The young fruit is eaten as a vegetable and is commonly grown for that purpose in tropical Asia.
It requires lots of heat and lots of water to thrive.In Israel, Luffa cylindrica has been in use since the time of the Late Roman Empire.
Luffa cylindrica fruits were decorated for the first time in art of the Byzantine era in Israel only.
The fruits were decorated on mosaics of churches and Jewish synagogues in Israel.The synonymous botanical specific epithet ""aegyptiaca"" was given to this plant in the 16th century when European botanists were introduced to the plant from its cultivation in Egypt.
In the European botanical literature, the plant was first described by Johann Veslingius in 1638, who named it ""Egyptian cucumber""."
Star Anise,Star Anise,"About 90% of the world's star anise crop is used for extraction of shikimic acid, a chemical intermediate used in the synthesis of oseltamivir (Tamiflu).Refer to the 4th edition of the European Pharmacopoeia (1153)Star anise contains anethole, the same compound that gives the unrelated anise its flavor.
Star anise is an ingredient of the traditional five-spice powder of Chinese cooking.
However, a derivation from the Persian بادیان bādiyān, ""fennel"", exists, with the Oxford English Dictionary indicating that its origin before that is unknown.ISO 11178:1995 - a specification for its dried fruitsStar anise is the major source of the chemical compound shikimic acid, a primary precursor in the pharmaceutical synthesis of the antiinfluenza drug, oseltamivir (Tamiflu).
coli bacteria was discovered in 2005, and applied in the 2009 swine flu outbreak to address Tamiflu shortages, also causing price increases for star anise as a raw material of shikimic acid."
Stephania root,Stephania tetrandra,"Its root is used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).Stephania contains tetrandrine, a potent smooth muscle relaxant.
The root contains many isoquinoline alkaloids: tetrandrine (0.6-0.9%), fangchinoline (0.5%), cyclanoline (0.1%) and dimethyltetrandrine iodide (muscle relaxant).
Notable among these is guang fang ji (Chinese: 廣防己; pinyin: guǎng fáng jǐ), Aristolochia fanchi, whose main toxic component is aristolochic acid, a potent carcinogen and nephrotoxin.
orbiculatus, Aristolochia fangchi, and Sinomenium acutum (Japanese Han Fang Ji or Qinfengteng).When Aristolochia fanghi is substituted for Stephania tetrandra, the resultant guang fang ji preparations can contain toxic amounts of aristolochic acid  Ingestion can lead to renal failure and even death; Aristolochia is used in TCM only with great caution.
The traditional route of ingestion of guang fang ji is via water decoction.
Since aristolochic acid has low water solubility, water decoction is believed to be a safer route than taking guang fang ji as an uncooked powder."
Stinging nettle leaf,Stinging nettle leaf,"The species is divided into six subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation upon contact (""contact urticaria"", a form of contact dermatitis).
Direct seeding is possible, but leads to great heterogeneity in maturity.Nettles may be used as a dye-stuff, producing yellow from the roots, or yellowish green from the leaves.Three cultivation techniques can be used for the stinging nettle: 1) direct sowing, 2) growing seedlings in nurseries with subsequent transplantation and 3) vegetative propagation via stolons or head cuttings.
In Ecuador there are indigenous healers that use stinging nettles with the belief that they improve fatigue and circulation, by rubbing raw leaves or flogging the plant directly on the body.Urtica dioica is considered to be native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and western North Africa."
Swallow-wort root,Swallow-wort root,"Asclepias tuberosa, the butterfly weed, is a species of milkweed native to eastern North America.
It is commonly known as butterfly weed because of the butterflies that are attracted to the plant by its color and its copious production of nectar.
It is also the larval food plant of the queen and monarch butterflies, as well as the dogbane tiger moth, milkweed tussock moth, and the unexpected cycnia.
It requires full sun.The plant looks similar to the lanceolate milkweed (Asclepias lanceolata), but is uniquely identified by the larger number of flowers, and the hairy stems that are not milky when broken.
It is most commonly found in fields with dry soil.Most easily propagated by seed.

Sweet wormwood herb,Sweet wormwood herb,"Further researches in the synergistic effect of artemisinin and flavonoids and their biological interaction between malaria and cancer are needed.Artemisia annua belongs to the plant family of Asteraceae and is an annual short-day plant.
It has been stated that there is a negative correlation between the presence of the mentioned components and cardiovascular diseases, cancer and parasitic disease such as malaria.Research to develop antimalarial drugs led to the discovery of artemisinin, a compound which is extracted from Artemisia annua, in the 1970s by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, for which she shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
While most TCM herbs are boiled at high temperature that can damage the active ingredient in Artemisia annua, one traditional source says that this herb is to be steeped in cold water; knowing this, scientists found that a better extract was obtained by using a low-temperature ether-based extraction method."

In finely ground form, talc finds use as a cosmetic (talcum powder), as a lubricant, and as a filler in paper manufacture.
With intravenous use, it may lead to pulmonary talcosis, a granulomatous inflammation in the lungs.The United States Food and Drug Administration considers talc (magnesium silicate) generally recognized as safe (GRAS) to use as an anticaking agent in table salt in concentrations smaller than 2%.Talc is a mineral that results from the metamorphism of magnesian minerals such as serpentine, pyroxene, amphibole, and olivine, in the presence of carbon dioxide and water."
Tangerine peel,Tangerine peel,"var., sometimes referred as Citrus tangerina) is a group of orange-colored citrus fruit consisting of hybrids of mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata).
The name was first used for fruit coming from Tangier, Morocco, described as a mandarin variety.
Genetic study has shown tangerines to be mandarin orange hybrids containing some pomelo DNA.
The term is currently applied to any reddish-orange mandarin (and, in some jurisdictions, mandarin-like hybrids, including some tangors).Tangerines are smaller and less rounded than common oranges.
Media related to Tangerines at Wikimedia CommonsTangerines were first grown and cultivated as a distinct crop in the Americas by a Major Atway in Palatka, Florida.
Until the 1970s, the Dancy was the most widely grown tangerine in the US; the popularity of the fruit led to the term ""tangerine"" being broadly applied as a marketing name.
Florida classifies tangerine-like hybrid fruits as tangerines for the purposes of sale and regulation; this classification is widely used but regarded as technically inaccurate in the industry."

Woad leaf,Natural dye,"Throughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson kermes, became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world.
In many cases the cost of these dyes far exceeded the cost of the wools and silks they colored, and often only the finest grades of fabrics were considered worthy of the best dyes.Dye-bearing lichen produce a wide range of greens, oranges, yellows, reds, browns, and bright pinks and purples.
ISBN 0-9508913-0-4.In medieval Europe, purple, violet, murrey and similar colors were produced by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes kermes and cochineal."
Woad root,Woad root,"The root word is the primary lexical unit of a word, and of a word family (this root is then called the base word), which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.
Content words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of root morphemes.
However, in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term ""root"" is generally synonymous with ""free morpheme"".
and it describes the suffix.The root of a word is a unit of meaning (morpheme) and, as such, it is an abstraction, though it can usually be represented alphabetically as a word might be.
This distinction between the word as a unit of speech and the root as a unit of meaning is even more important in the case of languages where roots have many different forms when used in actual words, as is the case in Semitic languages."
Yam,Yam (vegetable),"Yams are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical world regions, especially Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.
Its rapid growth crowds out native vegetation and is very difficult to remove since it can grow back from the tubers, and new vines can grow from the bulbils even after being cut down or burned.Because of their abundance and importance to survival, yams were highly regarded in Jamaican ceremonies and constitute part of many traditional West African ceremonies.A yam festival is usually held in the beginning of August at the end of the rainy season.
Some 870 species of yams are known, and 95% of these crops are grown in Africa.Yam tubers can grow up to 15 m (49 ft) in length and 7.6 to 15.2 cm (3.0 to 6.0 in) high."
