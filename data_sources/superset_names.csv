Dioscorea oppositifolia,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The plant previously called D. opposita is now considered to be the same species as D. oppositifolia. However Dioscorea polystachya is often incorrectly called Dioscorea opposita as well. Botanical works that point out that error may list, e.g., Dioscorea opposita auct. non Thunb. as a synonym of D. polystachya.",,,,,,,,
Capsicum,etymology and names,,,,,,"The generic name may come from Latin capsa, meaning 'box', presumably alluding to the pods; or from the Greek word κάπτω kapto, 'to gulp'. The name ""pepper"" comes from the similarity of piquance (spiciness or ""heat"") of the flavor to that of black pepper, Piper nigrum, although there is no botanical relationship with it or with Sichuan pepper. The original term, chilli (now chile in Mexico) came from the Nahuatl word chīlli, denoting a larger Capsicum variety cultivated at least since 3000 BC, as evidenced by remains found in pottery from Puebla and Oaxaca. Different varieties were cultivated in South America, where they are known as ajíes (singular ají), from the Quechua term for Capsicum.
The fruit (technically berries in the strict botanical sense) of Capsicum plants have a variety of names depending on place and type. The more piquant varieties are commonly called chili peppers, or simply chilis. The large, mild form is called bell pepper, or by color or both (green pepper, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, etc.) in North America, sweet pepper or simply pepper in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malaysia  but typically called capsicum in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, and India. Capsicum fruits of several varieties with commercial value are called by various European-language names in English, such as jalapeño, peperoncini, and peperoncito; many of these are usually sold pickled. Paprika (in English) refers to a powdered spice made of dried Capsicum of several sorts, though in Hungary and some other countries it is the name of the fruit as well.  Both whole and powdered chili are frequent ingredients in dishes prepared throughout the world, and characteristic of several cuisine styles, including Mexican, Sichuan (Szechuan) Chinese, Korean, Cajun and Creole, along with most South Asian and derived (e.g. Jamaican) curries. The powdered form is a key ingredient in various commercially prepared foodstuffs, such as pepperoni (a sausage), and chili con carne (a stew), and hot sauces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Capsicum,synonyms and common names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The name given to the Capsicum fruits varies between English-speaking countries.
In Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, heatless varieties are called ""capsicums"", while hot ones are called ""chilli""/""chillies"" (double L). Pepperoncini are also known as ""sweet capsicum"". The term ""bell peppers"" is almost never used, although C. annuum and other varieties which have a bell shape and are fairly hot, are often called ""bell chillies"".
In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the heatless varieties are commonly known simply as ""peppers"" (or more specifically ""green peppers"", ""red peppers"", etc.), while the hot ones are ""chilli""/""chillies"" (double L) or ""chilli peppers"".
In the United States and Canada, the common heatless varieties are referred to as ""bell peppers"", ""sweet peppers"", ""red/green/etc. peppers"", or simply ""peppers"", additionally in Indiana they may be referred to as ""mangoes/mango peppers"", while the hot varieties are collectively called ""chile""/""chiles"", ""chili""/""chilies"", or ""chili""/""chile peppers"" (one L only), ""hot peppers"", or named as a specific variety (e.g., banana pepper).
In Polish and in Hungarian, the term papryka and paprika (respectively) is used for all kinds of capsicums (the sweet vegetable, and the hot spicy), as well as for dried and ground spice made from them (named paprika in both U.S. English and Commonwealth English). Also, fruit and spice can be attributed as papryka ostra (hot pepper) or papryka słodka (sweet pepper). In Polish, the term pieprz (pepper) instead means only grains or ground black pepper (incl. the green, white, and red forms), but not capsicum. Sometimes, the hot capsicum spice is also called chilli. Similarly, Hungarian uses the word bors for the black pepper.
In Czech and Slovak, the term paprika is too used for all kinds of capsicums. For black pepper, Czech uses pepř, while Slovak uses čierne korenie (literally, black spice) or, dialectally, piepor.In Italy and the Italian- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland, the sweet varieties are called peperone and the hot varieties peperoncino (literally ""small pepper""). In Germany, the heatless varieties as well as the spice are called Paprika and the hot types are primarily called Peperoni or Chili while in Austria, Pfefferoni is more common for these; in Dutch, this word is also used exclusively for bell peppers, whereas chilli is reserved for powders, and hot pepper variants are referred to as Spaanse pepers (Spanish peppers). In Switzerland, though, the condiment powder made from capsicum is called Paprika (German language regions) and paprica (French and Italian language region). In French, capsicum is called poivron for sweet varieties and piment for hot ones.
Spanish-speaking countries use many different names for the varieties and preparations. In Mexico, the term chile is used for ""hot peppers"", while the heatless varieties are called pimiento (the masculine form of the word for pepper, which is pimienta).  Several other countries, such as Chile, whose name is unrelated, Perú, Puerto Rico, and Argentina, use ají. In Spain, heatless varieties are called pimiento and hot varieties guindilla. In Argentina and Spain, the variety C. chacoense is commonly known as ""putaparió"", a slang expression equivalent to ""damn it"", probably due to its extra-hot flavour.
In Indian English, the word ""capsicum"" is used exclusively for Capsicum annuum. All other varieties of hot capsicum are called chilli. In northern India and Pakistan, C. annuum is also commonly called shimla mirch in the local language and as ""Kodai Mozhagai"" in Tamil which roughly translates to ""umbrella chilli"" due to its appearance. Shimla,  incidentally, is a popular hill-station in India (and mirch means chilli in local languages).
In Japanese, tōgarashi (唐辛子, トウガラシ ""Chinese mustard"") refers to hot chili peppers, and particularly a spicy powder made from them which is used as a condiment, while bell peppers are called pīman (ピーマン, from the French piment or the Spanish pimiento).",,,,,,,,,
Capsicum,species and varieties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Capsicum consists of 20–27 species, five of which are domesticated: C. annuum, C. baccatum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, and C. pubescens.  Phylogenetic relationships between species have been investigated using biogeographical, morphological, chemosystematic, hybridization, and genetic data.  Fruits of Capsicum can vary tremendously in color, shape, and size both between and within species, which has led to confusion over the relationships among taxa.  Chemosystematic studies helped distinguish the difference between varieties and species. For example, C. baccatum var. baccatum had the same flavonoids as C. baccatum var. pendulum, which led researchers to believe the two groups belonged to the same species.Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways; for example, C. annuum includes the ""bell pepper"" variety, which is sold in both its immature green state and its red, yellow, or orange ripe state. This same species has other varieties, as well, such as the Anaheim chiles often used for stuffing, the dried ancho (before being dried it is referred to as a poblano) chile used to make chili powder, the mild-to-hot, ripe jalapeno used to make smoked jalapeno, known as chipotle.
Peru is thought to be the country with the highest cultivated Capsicum diversity since varieties of all five domesticates are commonly sold in markets in contrast to other countries. Bolivia is considered to be the country where the largest diversity of wild Capsicum peppers are consumed. Bolivian consumers distinguish two basic forms: ulupicas, species with small round fruits including C. eximium, C. cardenasii, C. eshbaughii, and C. caballeroi landraces; and arivivis, with small elongated fruits including C. baccatum var. baccatum and C. chacoense varieties.Most of the capsaicin in a pungent (hot) pepper is concentrated in blisters on the epidermis of the interior ribs (septa) that divide the chambers, or locules,  of the fruit to which the seeds are attached.  A study on capsaicin production in fruits of C. chinense showed that capsaicinoids are produced only in the epidermal cells of the interlocular septa of pungent fruits, that blister formation only occurs as a result of capsaicinoid accumulation, and that pungency and blister formation are controlled by a single locus, Pun1, for which there exist at least two recessive alleles that result in non-pungency of C. chinense fruits.The amount of capsaicin in hot peppers varies significantly among varieties, and is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU). The world's current hottest known pepper as rated in SHU is the 'Carolina Reaper,' which had been measured at over 2,200,000 SHU.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ginkgo biloba,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta). The sarcotesta has a strong smell that most people find unpleasant.
The ginkgo is classified in its own division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus Ginkgo and is the only extant species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales other than G. biloba are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene.Chinese scientists published a draft genome of Ginkgo biloba in 2016. The tree has a large genome of 10.6 billion DNA nucleobase ""letters"" (the human genome has three billion) and about 41,840 predicted genes which enable a considerable number of antibacterial and chemical defense mechanisms.",,,,,,,,
Ginkgo biloba,limited number of species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of Ginkgo can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day G. biloba (including G. adiantoides) and G. gardneri from the Paleocene of Scotland.At least morphologically, G. gardneri and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been ecotypes or subspecies. The implications would be that G. biloba had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation.
While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Epimedium,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species E. alpinum.

Açaí palm,name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The common name comes from the Portuguese adaptation of the Tupian word ïwaca'i, meaning ""[fruit that] cries or expels water"". The importance of the fruit as a staple food in the Amazon River delta gives rise to the local legend of how the plant got its name. The folklore says that chief Itaqui ordered all newborns put to death owing to a period of famine. When his own daughter gave birth and the child was sacrificed, she cried and died beneath a newly sprouted tree. The tree fed the tribe and was called açaí because that was the daughter's name (Iaçá) spelled backwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Camellia sinensis,nomenclature and taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The generic name Camellia is taken from the Latinized name of Rev. Georg Kamel, SJ (1661–1706), a Moravian-born Jesuit lay brother, pharmacist, and missionary to the Philippines.
Carl Linnaeus chose his name in 1753 for the genus to honor Kamel's contributions to botany (although Kamel did not discover or name this plant, or any Camellia, and Linnaeus did not consider this plant a Camellia but a Thea).Robert Sweet shifted all formerly Thea species to the genus Camellia in 1818. The name sinensis means ""from China"" in Latin.
Four varieties of C. sinensis are recognized.  Of these, C. sinensis var. sinensis and C. s. var. assamica (JW Masters) Kitamura are most commonly used for tea, and C. s. var. pubilimba Hung T. Chang and C. s. var. dehungensis (Hung T. Chang & BH Chen) TL Ming are sometimes used locally. The Cambod type tea (C. assamica subsp. lasiocaly) was originally considered a type of assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea.Tea plants are native to East Asia, and probably originated in the borderlands of north Burma and southwestern China.
Chinese (small leaf) tea [C. sinensis var. sinensis]
Chinese Western Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea [C. sinensis var. assamica]
Indian Assam (large leaf) tea [C. sinensis var. assamica]
Chinese Southern Yunnan Assam (large leaf) tea [C. sinensis var. assamica]Chinese (small leaf) type tea may have originated in southern China possibly with hybridization of unknown wild tea relatives. However, since no wild populations of this tea are known, the precise location of its origin is speculative.Given their genetic differences forming distinct clades, Chinese Assam type tea (C. s. var. assamica) may have two different parentages – one being found in southern Yunnan (Xishuangbanna, Pu'er City) and the other in western Yunnan (Lincang, Baoshan). Many types of Southern Yunnan Assam tea have been hybridized with the closely related species Camellia taliensis. Unlike Southern Yunnan Assam tea, Western Yunnan Assam tea shares many genetic similarities with Indian Assam type tea (also C. s. var. assamica). Thus, Western Yunnan Assam tea and Indian Assam tea both may have originated from the same parent plant in the area where southwestern China, Indo-Burma, and Tibet meet. However, as the Indian Assam tea shares no haplotypes with Western Yunnan Assam tea, Indian Assam tea is likely to have originated from an independent domestication. Some Indian Assam tea appears to have hybridized with the species Camellia pubicosta.Assuming a generation of 12 years, Chinese small leaf tea is estimated to have diverged from Assam tea around 22,000 years ago, while Chinese Assam tea and Indian Assam tea diverged 2,800 years ago. This divergence tea would correspond to the last glacial maximum.Chinese small leaf type tea was introduced into India in 1836 by the British and some Indian Assam type tea (e.g. Darjeeling tea) appear to be genetic hybrids of Chinese small leaf type tea, native Indian Assam, and possibly also closely related wild tea species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cinnamon,species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A number of species are often sold as cinnamon:
Cinnamomum cassia (cassia or Chinese cinnamon, the most common commercial type)
C. burmannii (Korintje, Padang cassia, or Indonesian cinnamon)
C. loureiroi (Saigon cinnamon, Vietnamese cassia, or Vietnamese cinnamon)
C. verum (Sri Lanka cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon or Cinnamomum zeylanicum)
C. citriodorum (Malabar cinnamon)Cassia induces a strong, spicy flavour and is often used in baking, especially associated with cinnamon rolls, as it handles baking conditions well. Among cassia, Chinese cinnamon is generally medium to light reddish brown in colour, hard and woody in texture, and thicker (2–3 mm (0.079–0.118 in) thick), as all of the layers of bark are used. Ceylon cinnamon, using only the thin inner bark, has a lighter brown colour, a finer, less dense and more crumbly texture. It is considered to be subtle and more aromatic in flavour than cassia and it loses much of its flavour during cooking.
The barks of the species are easily distinguished when whole, both in macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. Saigon cinnamon (C. loureiroi) and Chinese cinnamon (C. cassia) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills.
The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, but if it is treated with tincture of iodine (a test for starch), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon, but when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Albizia julibrissin,names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albizia julibrissin is known by a wide variety of common names, such as Persian silk tree or pink siris. It is also called Lenkoran acacia or bastard tamarind, though it is not too closely related to either genus. The species is usually called “Chinese Silk Tree” ""silk tree"" or ""mimosa"" in the United States, which is misleading - the former name can refer to any species of Albizia which is most common in any one locale. And, although once included in Mimosa, neither is it very close to the Mimoseae. To add to the confusion, several species of Acacia, notably Acacia baileyana and Acacia dealbata, are also known as ""mimosa"" (especially in floristry), and many Fabaceae trees with highly divided leaves are called thus in horticulture.
Its leaves slowly close during the night and during periods of rain, the leaflets bowing downward; thus its modern Persian name shabkhosb (شب‌خسب) means ""night sleeper"". In Japan its common names are nemunoki, nemurinoki and nenenoki which all mean ""sleeping tree"". Nemu tree is a partial translation of nemunoki.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Albizia julibrissin,invasive species,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the wild, the tree tends to grow in dry plains, sandy valleys, and uplands. It has become an invasive species in the United States. It has spread from southern New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, west to Missouri and Illinois, and south to Florida and Texas. It is cultivated in California and Oregon. Its seeds are numerous and they are fertile even over long periods of drought. Each pod, which resemble a flattened bean pod made of paper, contains an average of 8 seeds. The pods burst in strong winds, and the seeds carry over surprisingly long distances.

Breeding work is currently under way in the United States to produce ornamental plants which will not set seed and can therefore be planted without risk. However, in the eastern United States it is generally a short-lived tree, being highly susceptible to mimosa vascular wilt, a fungal disease caused by a species of Fusarium, though the disease does not seem to have seriously impacted its populations. Because of its invasive tendencies and disease susceptibility, it is rarely recommended as an ornamental plant in the US, though it is still widely planted in parts of Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cranberry,species and description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are three to four species of cranberry, classified into two sections:

Subgenus Oxycoccus, sect. OxycoccusVaccinium oxycoccos or Oxycoccus palustris (common cranberry, northern cranberry or cranberry) is widespread throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere, including northern Europe, northern Asia, and northern North America. It has small 5–10 mm (1⁄4–3⁄8 in) leaves. The flowers are dark pink, with a purple central spike, produced on finely hairy stems. The fruit is a small pale pink berry, with a refreshing sharp acidic flavor.
Vaccinium microcarpum or Oxycoccus microcarpus (small cranberry) occurs in northern North America, northern Europe and northern Asia, and differs from V. oxycoccos in the leaves being more triangular, and the flower stems hairless; additionally, their stems can also be smaller and produce a smaller number of flowers than V. ocycoccos. They also differ in the fact that their leaves can also be smaller in size, even though the main difference is their triangular shape. Some botanists include it within V. oxycoccos.
Vaccinium macrocarpon or Oxycoccus macrocarpus (large cranberry, American cranberry, bearberry) native to northern North America across Canada, and eastern United States, south to North Carolina at high altitudes). It differs from V. oxycoccos in the leaves being larger, 10–20 mm (3⁄8–3⁄4 in) long, and in its slightly apple-like taste.Subgenus Oxycoccus, sect. OxycoccoidesVaccinium erythrocarpum or Oxycoccus erythrocarpus (southern mountain cranberry) native to southeastern North America at high altitudes in the southern Appalachian Mountains, and also in eastern Asia.Cranberries are related to bilberries, blueberries, and huckleberries, all in Vaccinium subgenus Vaccinium. These differ in having bell-shaped flowers, the petals not being reflexed, and woodier stems, forming taller shrubs.
Some plants of the completely unrelated genus Viburnum are sometimes called ""highbush cranberries"" (e.g. Viburnum trilobum).

Loquat,history and taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,"The loquat is originally from China, where related species can be found growing in the wild. It was introduced into Japan and became naturalised there in very early times; it has been cultivated there for over 1,000 years. It has also become naturalised in Georgia,  Armenia, Afghanistan, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bermuda, Chile, Kenya, India, Iran, Iraq, South Africa, the whole Mediterranean Basin, Pakistan, New Zealand, Réunion, Tonga, Central America, Mexico, South America and in warmer parts of the United States (Hawaii, California, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina).  In Louisiana, many refer to loquats as ""misbeliefs"" and they grow in yards of homes. Chinese immigrants are presumed to have carried the loquat to Hawaii and California. It has been cultivated in Japan for about 1,000 years and presumably the fruits and seeds were brought back from China to Japan by the many Japanese scholars visiting and studying in China during the Tang Dynasty.
The loquat was often mentioned in medieval Chinese literature, such as the poems of Li Bai. Its original name is no longer used in most Chinese dialects, and has been replaced by pipa (枇杷), which is a reference to the fruit's visual resemblance to a miniature pipa lute.
Eriobotrya japonica was first described in Europe by Carl Peter Thunberg, has Mespilus japonica in 1780, and was relocated to the genera Eriobotrya (from Greek εριο ""wool"" and βοτρυών ""cluster"") by John Lindley, who published these changes in 1821. However, the first record of the species might have been alluded to in the 16th century, in Portugal, since the common name for the fruit, nêspera (from the modified nespilus, originally mespilus, which referred to the medlar), is already used (José Pedro Machado, Dicionário Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa, 1967). Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the sixteenth century, it is possible that some were brought back to Europe, as was probably the case with other species like the hachiya persimmon variety. 
The most common variety in Portugal is the late ripening Tanaka , where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal it is also popularly called magnório/magnólio, probably something to do with the french botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called ""nísperos"" and are comercially explored, Spain being the largest producer worldwide, after China, with  41,487t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hybrids are common, but hybridization has only been recorded between members of the same subgenus.  While plants of subgenus Equisetum are usually referred to as horsetails, those of subgenus Hippochaete are often called scouring rushes, especially when unbranched.
Two Equisetum plants are sold commercially under the names Equisetum japonicum (barred horsetail) and Equisetum camtschatcense (Kamchatka horsetail). These are both types of E. hyemale var. hyemale, although they may also be listed as varieties of E. hyemale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A proposal to split Ranunculus into several genera has thus been published in a new classification for the tribe Ranunculeae. The split (and often re-recognized) genera include Arcteranthis Greene, Beckwithia Jeps., Callianthemoides Tamura, Coptidium (Prantl) Beurl. ex Rydb., Cyrtorhyncha Nutt. ex Torr. & A.Gray, Ficaria Guett., Krapfia DC., Kumlienia E.

Aloe vera,taxonomy and etymology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The species has a number of synonyms: A. barbadensis Mill., Aloe indica Royle, Aloe perfoliata L. var. vera and A. vulgaris Lam. Common names include Chinese Aloe, Indian Aloe, True Aloe, Barbados Aloe, Burn Aloe, First Aid Plant. The species epithet vera means ""true"" or ""genuine"". Some literature identifies the white-spotted form of Aloe vera as Aloe vera var. chinensis; and it has been suggested that the spotted form of Aloe vera may be conspecific with A. massawana. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Aloe perfoliata var. vera, and was described again in 1768 by Nicolaas Laurens Burman as Aloe vera in Flora Indica on 6 April and by Philip Miller as Aloe barbadensis some ten days after Burman in the Gardener's Dictionary.Techniques based on DNA comparison suggest Aloe vera is relatively closely related to Aloe perryi, a species endemic to Yemen. Similar techniques, using chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have also suggested it is closely related to Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata. With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan. The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.",,,,,

Iris scariosa,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is written as 膜苞鸢尾 in Chinese script, and known as mo bao yuan wei in Pidgin.It is commonly known as 'Film bud Iris' or 'Membrane bud Iris (in China). It is also known as 'Iris leathery' in Russia. It was known in UK as the 'Scarious iris'.The Latin specific epithet scariosa refers to shrivelled, or thin dry organs. This refers to the membranous bracts or spathes, under the flowers.
It was originally described from specimens collected from near to the Caspian Sea.It was first described by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link and then published by Karl Ludwig Willdenow (using Link's description of the plant), in 'Jahrbücher der Gewächskunde' (of Berlin and Leipzig, Jahrb. Gewächsk.) Vol.1 Issue3, page71 in 1820.It was later published by Carl Ledebour in 'Fl Ross' Vol.4 page104 in 1853, then in 'Gartenflora' Vol.27 page325 in 1878, with a colour illustration (labelled as Iris eulefeldi). then by Maxim in 'Bull Acad Sci St. Petersb' Vol.26 page534 in 1880 and by Boris Fedtschenko in 'Kom Fl URSS' Vol.4 page550 in 1935.An illustration of the iris by Matilda Smith was published in Curtis’s Botanical Magazine, vol. 112 [ser. 3, vol. 42] no.6902 in 1886.In 1979, Shevchenko (Iris L. in A.I. Galushko (edited) 'Flora Severnogo Kavkaza' Vol.3 page79, University of Rostov) divided Iris glaucescens and Iris scariosa into 2 separate species. He thought that there was several morphological and ecological differences between the 2 species. But he did not publish these. Also he noted that the Iris scariosa distribution range was limited to west of the Caspian Sea. But this range classification is disputed by other authors, although most sources still split the two irises into separate species.
It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 2 October 2014.It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life.Iris scariosa is not yet an accepted name by the RHS.",,,,,,,,
Gynostemma pentaphyllum,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gynostemma pentaphyllum is known as Jiaogulan (Chinese: 绞股蓝 in China. The plant was first described in 1406 CE by Zhu Xiao, who presented a description and sketch in the book Materia Medica for Famine as a survival food rather than a medicinal herb. The earliest record of jiaogulan's use as a drug comes from herbalist Li Shizhen's book Compendium of Materia Medica published in 1578, identifying jiaogulan for treating various ailments such as hematuria, edema in the pharynx and neck, tumors, and trauma. While Li Shizhen had confused jiaogulan with an analogous herb Wulianmei, in 1848 Wu Qi-Jun rectified this confusion in Textual Investigation of Herbal Plants.
Modern recognition of the plant outside of China originated from research in sugar substitutes. In the 1970s, while analyzing the sweet component of the jiaogulan plant (known as amachazuru in Japan), Masahiro Nagai discovered saponins identical to those in Panax ginseng. Continued research has described several more saponins (gypenosides) comparable or identical to those found in ginseng. Panax ginseng contains ginsenosides while gypenoside saponins have been found in jiaogulan.",,,,,,,,
Lavandula,nomenclature and taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lavandula stoechas, L. pedunculata and L. dentata were known in Roman times. From the Middle Ages onwards, the European species were considered two separate groups or genera, Stoechas (L. stoechas, L. pedunculata, L. dentata) and Lavandula (L. spica and L. latifolia), until Linnaeus combined them. He only recognised five species in Species Plantarum (1753), L. multifida and L. dentata (Spain) and L. stoechas and L. spica from Southern Europe. L. pedunculata was included within L. stoechas.
By 1790, L. pinnata and L. carnosa were recognised. The latter was subsequently transferred to Anisochilus. By 1826 Frédéric Charles Jean Gingins de la Sarraz listed 12 species in three sections, and by 1848 eighteen species were known.One of the first modern major classifications was that of Dorothy Chaytor in 1937 at Kew. The six sections she proposed for 28 species still left many intermediates that could not easily be assigned. Her sections included Stoechas, Spica, Subnudae, Pterostoechas, Chaetostachys and Dentatae. However all the major cultivated and commercial forms resided in the Stoechas and Spica sections. There were four species within Stoechas (Lavandula stoechas, L. dentata, L. viridis and L. pedunculata) while Spica had three (L. officinalis (now L. angustifolia), L. latifolia and L. lanata). She believed that the garden varieties were hybrids between true lavender L. angustifolia and spike lavender (L. latifolia).
Lavandula has three subgenera:
Subgenus Lavandula is mainly of woody shrubs with entire leaves. It contains the principal species grown as ornamental plants and for oils. They are found across the Mediterranean region to northeast Africa and western Arabia.
Subgenus Fabricia consists of shrubs and herbs, and it has a wide distribution from the Atlantic to India. It contains some ornamental plants.
Subgenus Sabaudia constitutes two species in the southwest Arabian peninsula and Eritrea, which are rather distinct from the other species, and are sometimes placed in their own genus Sabaudia.In addition, there are numerous hybrids and cultivars in commercial and horticultural usage.The first major clade corresponds to subgenus Lavendula, and the second Fabricia. The Sabaudia group is less clearly defined. Within the lavendula clade, the subclades correspond to the existing sections, but place Dentatae separately from Stoechas, not within it. Within the Fabricia clade, the subclades correspond to Pterostoechas, Subnudae, and Chaetostachys.
Thus the current classification includes 39 species distributed across 8 sections (the original 6 of Chaytor and the two new sections of Upson and Andrews), in three subgenera (see table below). However, since lavender cross-pollinates easily, there are countless variations that present difficulties in classification.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eucalyptus,taxonomy and naming,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The genus Eucalyptus was first formally described in 1789 by Charles Louis L'Héritier de Brutelle who published the description in his book Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum along with a description of the type species, Eucalyptus obliqua. The name Eucalyptus is derived from the Ancient Greek words eu meaning ""good"", ""well"", ""true"", ""beautiful"" or ""very"" and kalypto meaning ""cover"", ""conceal"" or ""hide"" referring to the operculum covering the flower buds.The type specimen was collected in 1777 by David Nelson, the gardener-botanist on Cook's third voyage. He collected the specimen on Bruny Island and sent it to de Brutelle who was working in London at that time.",,,,
Eucalyptus,species and hybridism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Over 700 species of Eucalyptus are known; refer to the List of Eucalyptus species for a comprehensive list of species. Some have diverged from the mainstream of the genus to the extent that they are quite isolated genetically and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics. Most, however, may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species, which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which gene exchange still occurs. In these situations, many species appear to grade into one another, and intermediate forms are common. In other words, some species are relatively fixed genetically, as expressed in their morphology, while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives.
Hybrid individuals have not always been recognised as such on first collection and some have been named as new species, such as E. chrysantha (E. preissiana × E. sepulcralis) and E. ""rivalis"" (E. marginata × E. megacarpa). Hybrid combinations are not particularly common in the field, but some other published species frequently seen in Australia have been suggested to be hybrid combinations. For example, E. erythrandra is believed to be E. angulosa × E. teraptera and due to its wide distribution is often referred to in texts.Renantherin, a phenolic compound present in the leaves of some eucalyptus species, allows chemotaxonomic discrimination in the sections renantheroideae and renantherae and the ratio of the amount of leucoanthocyanins varies considerably in certain species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eucalyptus,eucalyptus as plantation species,,,,,,,,"In the 20th century, scientists around the world experimented with eucalyptus species. They hoped to grow them in the tropics, but most experimental results failed until breakthroughs in the 1960s-1980s in species selection, silviculture, and breeding programs ""unlocked"" the potential of eucalypts in the tropics. Prior to then, as Brett Bennett noted in a 2010 article, eucalypts were something of the ""El Dorado"" of forestry. Today, eucalyptus is the most widely planted type of tree in plantations around the world, in South America (mainly in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), South Africa, Australia, India, Galicia, Portugal and many more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anisodus tanguticus,scientific name,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The generic name Anisodus is a compound of the Greek words ἄνισος (ánisos, 'unequal') and ὀδούς (odoús, 'tooth'), hence signifying 'having teeth of different lengths' – so called from the observation that certain species have calyces featuring lobes or teeth of unequal length.
The specific name tanguticus is a geographical epithet, signifying 'belonging to the Tangut region' i.e. 'growing in the land of the Tangut people' – which includes the region of Amdo, one of the three traditional regions of Tibet (taking in the modern Chinese province of Qinghai and part of the south of the modern Chinese province of Gansu). Historically, the Tangut, or Western Xia empire included, at its greatest extent, also parts of what are now the Chinese provinces of Ningxia, northern Shaanxi, northeastern Xinjiang, southwestern Inner Mongolia and southernmost Outer Mongolia – all of which in fact lie outside the range of Anisodus tanguticus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vigna umbellata,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The cultivated Asiatic Vigna species belong to the sub-genus Ceratotropis, a fairly distinct and homogeneous group, largely restricted to Asia, which has a chromosome number of 2n = 22 (except V. glabrescens, 2n = 44). There are seven cultivated species within the sub-genus, including mung bean or green gram (V. radiata), black gram or urad bean (V. mungo), adzuki bean (V. angularis) and moth bean (V. aconitifolia) as well as a number of wild species. Artificial crosses have been made between V. mungo and V. umbellata to produce improved mung bean varieties (e.g. Singh et al., 2006).
There are three more or less secondary gene pools within the group: ricebean is closer to V. angularis than to the other species, being in the Angulares group (Kaga et al., 1996, Tomooka et al., 2003).",,,,,,,,
Hypericum perforatum,invasive species,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Hypericum perforatum is grown commercially in some regions of south east Europe, it is listed as a noxious weed in more than twenty countries and has introduced populations in South and North America, India, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. In pastures, St John's wort acts as both a toxic and invasive weed. It replaces native plant communities and forage vegetation to the extent of making productive land nonviable or becoming an invasive species in natural habitats and ecosystems. Ingestion by livestock such as horses, sheep, and cattle can cause photosensitization, central nervous system depression, spontaneous abortion or death. Effective herbicides for control of Hypericum include 2,4-D, picloram, and glyphosate. In western North America three beetles Chrysolina quadrigemina, Chrysolina hyperici and Agrilus hyperici have been introduced as biocontrol agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oregano,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many subspecies and strains of oregano have been developed by humans over centuries for their unique flavours or other characteristics. Tastes range from spicy or astringent to more complicated and sweet. Simple oregano sold in garden stores as Origanum vulgare may have a bland taste and larger, less-dense leaves, and is not considered the best for culinary use, with a taste less remarkable and pungent. It can pollinate other more sophisticated strains, but the offspring are rarely better in quality.
The related species, Origanum onites (Greece, Turkey) and O. syriacum (West Asia), have similar flavours. A closely related plant is marjoram from Turkey, which differs significantly in taste though, because phenolic compounds are missing from its essential oil. Some varieties show a flavour intermediate between oregano and marjoram.",,,,,,,,

Lingzhi mushroom,regional names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ChineseThe name of the lingzhi fungus has a two thousand-year-old history. The Old Chinese name 靈芝 was first recorded during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 9 AD). In the Chinese language, língzhī (灵芝) is a compound. It comprises líng (灵); ""spirit, spiritual; soul; miraculous; sacred; divine; mysterious; efficacious; effective)"" as, for example, in the name of the Lingyan Temple in Jinan, and zhī (芝); ""(traditional) plant of longevity; fungus; seed; branch; mushroom; excrescence""). Fabrizio Pregadio notes, ""The term zhi, which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or 'excrescences'."" Zhi occurs in other Chinese plant names, such as zhīmá (芝麻; ""sesame"" or ""seed""), and was anciently used a phonetic loan character for zhǐ (芷; ""Angelica iris""). Chinese differentiates Ganoderma species into chìzhī (赤芝; ""red mushroom"") G. lucidum, and zǐzhī (紫芝; ""purple mushroom"") G. japonicum.
Lingzhi has several synonyms. Of these, ruìcǎo (瑞草; ""auspicious plant"") (ruì 瑞; ""auspicious; felicitous omen"" with the suffix cǎo 草; ""plant; herb"") is the oldest; the Erya dictionary (c. 3rd century BCE) defines xiú 苬, interpreted as a miscopy of jūn (菌; ""mushroom"") as zhī (芝; ""mushroom""), and the commentary of Guo Pu (276–324) says, ""The [zhi] flowers three times in one year. It is a [ruicao] felicitous plant."" Other Chinese names for Ganoderma include ruìzhī (瑞芝; ""auspicious mushroom""), shénzhī (神芝; ""divine mushroom"", with shen; ""spirit; god' supernatural; divine""), mùlíngzhī (木灵芝) (with ""tree; wood""), xiāncǎo (仙草; ""immortality plant"", with xian; ""(Daoism) transcendent; immortal; wizard""), and língzhīcǎo (灵芝草) or zhīcǎo (芝草; ""mushroom plant"").
Since both Chinese ling and zhi have multiple meanings, lingzhi has diverse English translations. Renditions include ""[zhi] possessed of soul power"", ""Herb of Spiritual Potency"" or ""Mushroom of Immortality"", ""Numinous Mushroom"", ""divine mushroom"", ""divine fungus"", ""Magic Fungus"", and ""Marvelous Fungus"".
EnglishIn English, lingzhi or ling chih (sometimes spelled ""ling chi"", using the French EFEO Chinese transcription) is a Chinese loanword.
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) gives the definition, ""The fungus Ganoderma lucidum, believed in China to confer longevity and used as a symbol of this on Chinese ceramic ware."", and identifies the etymology of the word as Chinese: líng, ""divine"" + zhī, ""fungus"". According to the OED, the earliest recorded usage of the Wade–Giles romanization ling chih is 1904, and of the Pinyin lingzhi is 1980.
In addition to the transliterated loanword, English names include ""glossy ganoderma"" and ""shiny polyporus"".
JapaneseThe Japanese word reishi (霊芝) is a Sino-Japanese loanword deriving from the Chinese língzhī (灵芝; 靈芝). Its modern Japanese kanji, 霊, is the shinjitai (""new character form"") of the kyūjitai (""old character form""), 靈. Synonyms for reishi are divided between Sino-Japanese borrowings and native Japanese coinages. Sinitic loanwords include literary terms such as zuisō (瑞草, from ruìcǎo; ""auspicious plant"") and sensō (仙草, from xiāncǎo; ""immortality plant""). The Japanese writing system uses shi or shiba (芝) for ""grass; lawn; turf"", and take or kinoko (茸) for ""mushroom"" (e.g., shiitake). A common native Japanese name is mannentake (万年茸; ""10,000-year mushroom""). Other Japanese terms for reishi include kadodetake (門出茸; ""departure mushroom""), hijiridake (聖茸; ""sage mushroom""), and magoshakushi (孫杓子; ""grandchild ladle"").

KoreanThe Korean name, yeongji (영지; 靈芝) is also borrowed from, so a cognate with, the Chinese word língzhī (灵芝; 靈芝). It is often called yeongjibeoseot (영지버섯; ""yeongji mushroom"") in Korean, with the addition of the native word beoseot (버섯) meaning ""mushroom"". Other common names include bullocho (불로초, 不老草; ""elixir grass"") and jicho (지초; 芝草). According to color, yeongji mushrooms can be classified as jeokji (적지; 赤芝) for ""red"", jaji (자지; 紫芝) for ""purple"", heukji (흑지; 黑芝) for ""black"", cheongji (청지; 靑芝) for ""blue"" or ""green"", baekji (백지; 白芝) for ""white"", and hwangji (황지; 黃芝) for ""yellow"".

ThaiThe Thai word het lin chue (เห็ดหลินจือ) is a compound of the native word het (เห็ด) meaning ""mushroom"" and the loanword lin chue (หลินจือ) from the Chinese língzhī (灵芝; 靈芝).

VietnameseThe Vietnamese language word linh chi is a loanword from Chinese. It is often used with nấm, the Vietnamese word for ""mushroom"", thus nấm linh chi is the equivalent of ""lingzhi mushroom"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lingzhi mushroom,taxonomy and ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lingzhi, also known as Reishi is the ancient ""mushroom of immortality,"" revered for over 2,000 years. Uncertainty exists about which Ganoderma species was most widely utilized as Lingzhi mushroom in ancient times, and likely a few different common species were considered interchangeable. However, in the most famous book of herbal medicine in China, the Bencao Gangmu (1578), a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms were used for different purposes and defined by color. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient Lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017), as well as other researchers and based on molecular work, red reishi is most likely to be Ganoderma lingzhi Sheng H. Wu, Y. Cao & Y.C. Dai (2012). This is the species that is most widely found in Chinese herb shops today, and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7-10 other Ganoderma species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of triterpenes such as ganoderic acid and its derivatives which vary widely among species. Lingzhi was formerly known as Ganoderma lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst. (1881), first described by Curtis. G. lucidum is part of a species complex that encompasses several varieties and forms (Species Fungorum). Research on the genus is on-going, but a number of recent phylogentic analyses have been published in the last number of years.",,,,,,
Iris japonica,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has the common names of 'fringed iris', 'Putchcock' or 'Shaga' (in Japan), and butterfly flower (in China).It is written as 蝴蝶花 in Chinese script, and known as hu die hua in Pidgin in China.

The Latin specific epithet japonica refers to from Japan, even though the plant is thought to have originated in China.
Iris japonica was first named by Carl Peter Thunberg, (the Swedish botanist) in his 1784 publication, 'Flora Japonica'. It was introduced to Europe in 1792 from China, by Thomas Evans of the East India Company. It was then first published and described by Thunberg in 'Transactions of the Linnean Society of London' (Trans. Linn. Soc. London) Volume 2 page327 on 1 May 1794.

Actaea racemosa,taxonomy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The plant species has a history of taxonomic uncertainty dating back to Carl Linnaeus, who—on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds—had placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, is not closely related to black cohosh, and may be unsafe if used together.",,,,,,,,

Lobelia is probably the base form from which many other lobelioid genera are derived; it is therefore highly paraphyletic and not a good genus in a cladistic sense. For example, the Hawaiian species (see Hawaiian lobelioids), currently classified in several genera, originated from a single introduction to a now-submerged Hawaiian Island 15 million years ago, probably from an Asian Lobelia in Lobelia subg.

Datura stramonium,etymology and common names,,,,,"The genus name is derived from the plant's Hindi name, dhatūra, ultimately from Sanskrit dhattūra 'white thorn-apple'. Stramonium is originally from Greek στρύχνος ""nightshade"" and μανιακός ""mad"".In the United States, the plant is called ""jimsonweed"", or more rarely ""Jamestown weed"" deriving from the town of Jamestown, Virginia, where English soldiers consumed it while attempting to suppress Bacon's Rebellion. They spent 11 days in altered mental states:

The James-Town Weed (which resembles the Thorny Apple of Peru, and I take to be the plant so call'd) is supposed to be one of the greatest coolers in the world. This being an early plant, was gather'd very young for a boil'd salad, by some of the soldiers sent thither to quell the rebellion of Bacon (1676); and some of them ate plentifully of it, the effect of which was a very pleasant comedy, for they turned natural fools upon it for several days: one would blow up a feather in the air; another would dart straws at it with much fury; and another, stark naked, was sitting up in a corner like a monkey, grinning and making mows [grimaces] at them; a fourth would fondly kiss and paw his companions, and sneer in their faces with a countenance more antic than any in a Dutch droll.In this frantic condition they were confined, lest they should, in their folly, destroy themselves—though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature. Indeed, they were not very cleanly; for they would have wallowed in their own excrements if they had not been prevented. A thousand such simple tricks they played, and after eleven days returned themselves again, not remembering anything that had passed.

Common names for D. stramonium vary by region and include thornapple and moon flower, and it has the Spanish name toloache. Other names for the plant include hell's bells, devil's trumpet, devil's weed, tolguacha, Jamestown weed, stinkweed, locoweed, pricklyburr, false castor oil plant, devil's cucumber, and thornapple.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rose,ornamental plants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as Rosa glauca and Rosa rubiginosa), ornamental thorns (such as Rosa sericea) or for their showy fruit (such as Rosa moyesii).
Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. Many thousands of rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having mutated into additional petals.
In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rose,species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The genus Rosa is subdivided into four subgenera:

Bilberry,etymology and common names,,,,,"The name “bilberry” appears to have a Scandinavian origin, possibly from as early as 1577, being similar to the Danish word bølle for whortleberry with the addition of ""berry"". The bilberry (especially Vaccinium myrtillus) is also known by a number of other names including blaeberry  in the Scots language, whortleberry  in southern England, and w(h)imberry or w(h)inberry in Derbyshire, along the Anglo-Welsh border, and south Wales, amongst other places.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bilberry,description and species,,,,"Bilberries – which are native to Europe – are different from North American blueberries, although the species are closely related and belong to the same genus, Vaccinium. Bilberry are non-climacteric fruits with a smooth, circular outline at the end opposite the stalk, whereas blueberries retain persistent sepals there, leaving a rough, star-shaped pattern of five flaps. Bilberries grow singly or in pairs rather than in clusters, as blueberries do, and blueberries have more evergreen leaves. Bilberries are dark in color, and usually appear near black with a slight shade of purple.
Bilberries and blueberries contain diverse anthocyanins, including delphinidin and cyanidin glycosides.  While blueberry fruit pulp is light green in color, bilberry is red or purple. The high anthocyanin content may cause staining of the fingers, lips, and tongue of consumers.Bilberries include several closely related species of the genus Vaccinium, including:

Vaccinium myrtillus L. (bilberry)
Vaccinium uliginosum L. (bog bilberry, bog blueberry, bog whortleberry, bog huckleberry, northern bilberry, ground hurts)
Vaccinium caespitosum Michx. (dwarf bilberry)
Vaccinium deliciosum Piper (Cascade bilberry)

Taraxacum,names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Latin name Taraxacum originates in medieval Persian writings on pharmacy. The Persian scientist Al-Razi around 900 CE wrote ""the tarashaquq is like chicory"". The Persian scientist and philosopher Ibn Sīnā around 1000 CE wrote a book chapter on Taraxacum. Gerard of Cremona, in translating Arabic to Latin around 1170, spelled it tarasacon.The English name, dandelion, is a corruption of the French dent de lion meaning ""lion's tooth"", referring to the coarsely toothed leaves. The plant is also known as blowball, cankerwort, doon-head-clock, witch's gowan, milk witch, lion's-tooth, yellow-gowan, Irish daisy, monks-head, priest's-crown, and puff-ball; other common names include faceclock, pee-a-bed, wet-a-bed,swine's snout, white endive, and wild endive.The English folk name ""piss-a-bed"" (and indeed the equivalent contemporary French pissenlit) refers to the strong diuretic effect of the plant's roots. In various northeastern Italian dialects, the plant is known as pisacan (""dog pisses""), because they are found at the side of pavements.In Swedish, it is called maskros (worm rose) after the small insects (thrips) usually present in the flowers. In Finnish and Estonian, the names (voikukka, võilill) translate as butter flower, due to the color of the flower. In Lithuanian, it is known as ""Pienė"", meaning ""milky"", because of the white latex that is produced when the stems are cut.  The Welsh (dant-y-llew), German (Löwenzahn), Norwegian (løvetann), Portuguese (dente de leão) and Spanish (diente de león) names mean the same as the French and the English names. In Czech it is known as pampeliška where the ""liška"" part directly translates to a ""fox"", possibly due to the colour of the flower.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kava,history and names,,,,,,,,,,"Kava is believed to have been domesticated in either New Guinea or Vanuatu by seafarers. It is believed to be a domesticated variety of Piper subbullatum which is native to New Guinea and the Philippines.It was spread by the Austronesian Lapita culture after contact eastward into the rest of Polynesia. It is endemic to Oceania and is not found in other Austronesian groups. Kava reached Hawaii, but it is absent in Aotearoa where it cannot grow. Consumption of kava is also believed to be the reason why betel chewing, ubiquitous elsewhere, was lost for Austronesians in Oceania.According to Lynch (2002), the reconstructed Proto-Polynesian term for the plant, *kava, was derived from the Proto-Oceanic term *kawaRi in the sense of a ""bitter root"" or ""potent root [used as fish poison]"". It originally referred to Zingiber zerumbet, which was used to make a similar mildly psychoactive bitter drink in Austronesian rituals. Cognates for *kava include Pohnpeian sa-kau; Tongan, Niue, Rapa Nui, Tuamotuan, and Rarotongan kava; Samoan and Marquesan ʻava; and Hawaiian ʻawa. In some languages, most notably Māori kawa, the cognates have come to mean ""bitter"", ""sour"", or ""acrid"" to the taste.In the Cook Islands, the reduplicated forms of kawakawa or kavakava are also applied to the unrelated members of the genus Pittosporum. And in other languages like in Futunan, compound terms like kavakava atua refer to other species belonging to the genus Piper. The reduplication of the base form is indicative of falsehood or likeness, in the sense of ""false kava"". In Aotearoa, it was applied to the kawakawa (Piper excelsum) which is endemic to Aotearoa and nearby Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, and the Rangitāhua Islands. It was exploited by the Māori based on previous knowledge of the kava, as the latter could not survive in the colder climates of Aotearoa. The Māori name for the plant, kawakawa, is derived from the same etymon as kava, but reduplicated. It is a sacred tree among the Māori people. It is seen as a symbol of death, corresponding to the rangiora (Brachyglottis repanda) which is the symbol of life. However, kawakawa has no psychoactive properties. Its connection to kava is limited purely on similarity in appearance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sambucus nigra,subspecies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are several other closely related species, native to Asia and North America, which are similar, and sometimes treated as subspecies of Sambucus nigra. The blue or Mexican elderberry, Sambucus mexicana, is now generally treated as one or two subspecies of Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis and Sambucus nigra subsp. caerulea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lonicera japonica,as an invasive species,,"Japanese honeysuckle has become naturalized in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, and much of the US, including Hawaii, as well as a number of Pacific and Caribbean islands. It is classified as a noxious weed in Texas, Illinois, and Virginia, and is banned in Indiana and New Hampshire. It is listed on the New Zealand National Pest Plant Accord as an unwanted organism.
It grows extremely rapidly in parts of America such as southwestern Ohio and is virtually impossible to control in woodland edge zones due to its rapid spread via tiny fruit seeds. Japanese honeysuckle was first found in the US in the late 1800s in Ohio. It aggressively grows over native shrubs and trees, choking them, and can also form mat-like monocultures that prevent the establishment of native species. The succession cycle of a forest is not all that different than a human life span – 70 to 100 years. Accordingly, it is the aggressive displacement that poses a long term threat to future generations of native forests. It is also very difficult to manage in semi-wild areas such as in large rural yards.
It can be controlled to some degree via labor-intensive methods such as cutting or burning the plant to root level and repeating at two-week intervals until nutrient reserves in the roots are depleted. It can also be controlled through annual applications of glyphosate, or through grubbing if high labor and soil destruction are not of concern. Cutting the honeysuckle to within 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) of the ground and then applying glyphosate has proven to be more effective, provided that the mixture is rather concentrated (20–25%) and is applied immediately after making the cut.
In urban environments of Southwest Ohio where deer population is high, some level of longer-term management has been observed by cutting the honeysuckle to within 18–24"" of the ground. Grazing deer substantially slow down regrowth. Once the canopy from a stand of honeysuckle or that of an individual plant exceeds the grazing height of deer, this control method is ineffective. As recently as the late 1990s, Japanese honeysuckle was not considered to be part of a deer's diet, but by 2010 urban deer in southwest Ohio could be observed grazing on it with enthusiasm, especially freshly cut honeysuckle stocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sichuan pepper,names,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Sichuan pepper is known in Chinese as huā jiāo. A lesser-used name is shān jiāo (山椒), not to be confused with Tasmanian mountain pepper, which is also the root of the Japanese sanshō (山椒). Confusingly, the Korean sancho (산초, 山椒) refers to a different if related species (Z. schinifolium), while Z. piperitum is known as chopi (초피).The name hua jiao in a strict sense refers to the northern China peppercorn, Z. bungeanum, according to the common consensus in current scholarly literature. However, hua jiao is also the generic term in commerce for all such viable spices harvested from the genus. This includes Z. simulans (Hance), identified by a taxonomical authorities as the yě huā jiāo (野花椒, ""wild peppercorn""), though elsewhere given as chuān jiāo (川椒, ""Sichuan pepper""), leading to the tendency to regard this as the bona fide ""Sichuan pepper"". While the exact flavor and composition of different species from the genus Zanthoxylum vary, most share the same essential characteristics. So while the terms ""Sichuan pepper"" and sanshō may refer specifically to Z. simulans and Z. piperitum, respectively, the two are commonly used interchangeably.The Indian subcontinent uses a number of varieties of Sichuan pepper. In Konkani, it is known as tephal or tirphal. In Nepali, Z. alatum is known as timur (टिमुर) or timbur, while in Tibetan, it is known as yer ma (གཡེར་མ) and in Bhutan as thingye. It is also called current mirchi commonly.In Indonesia's North Sumatra province, around Lake Toba, Z. acanthopodium is known as andaliman in the Batak Toba language and tuba in the Batak Karo language.In America, names such as ""Szechwan pepper"", ""Chinese pepper"", ""Japanese pepper"", ""aniseed pepper"", ""sprice pepper"", ""Chinese prickly-ash"", ""fagara,"" ""sansho"", ""Nepal pepper"", ""Indonesian lemon pepper"", and others are used, sometimes referring to specific species within this group, since this plant is not well known enough in the West to have an established name. Some brands also use the English description ""dehydrated prickly ash"", since the Sichuan pepper and Japanese sansho are from related plants that are sometimes called prickly ash because of their thorns (though purveyors in the US do sell the native prickly ash species Z. americanum because it is recognized as a folk remedy). In Kachin State of Myanmar, the Jinghpaw people widely use it in traditional cuisine. It is known as ma chyang among them. Its leaves are served as one of ingredients in cooking soups. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, it is known as dambaray or dambara and is mostly used in street foods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Luóhàn (羅漢) is a shortened form of āluóhàn (Chinese: 阿羅漢), which is an old transliteration of the Indian Sanskrit word arhat (prakrit: arahant). In early Buddhist traditions, a monk who becomes enlightened is called an arhat who attains the ""fruition of arhatship"" (Sanskrit: arhattaphala). This was rendered in Chinese as luóhàn guǒ (羅漢果 literally ""arhat fruit"") which later became the Chinese and western commercial designation for this type of sweet fruit.It may also be called la han qua (from Vietnamese la hán quả), Buddha fruit, or longevity fruit (also used for other fruits).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Olive,as an invasive species,,"Since its first domestication, O. europaea has been spreading back to the wild from planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have been largely swamped by feral plants.In some other parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major woody weed that displaces native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced red fox and by many bird species, including the European starling and the native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, the oil-rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native sclerophyll woodlands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
