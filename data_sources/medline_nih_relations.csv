0,Acai,"
Common Names:¬†
  acai,¬†a√ßa√≠","
The acai palm tree, native to tropical Central and South America, produces a deep purple fruit. The word ‚Äúacai,‚Äù which comes from a language of the native people of the region, means ‚Äúfruit that cries.‚Äù The acai fruit has long been an important food source for indigenous peoples of the Amazon¬†region.
Acai products have become popular in the United States, where they have been marketed for weight-loss and anti-aging¬†purposes.
The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against companies that marketed acai weight loss products in allegedly deceptive¬†ways.
Acai fruit pulp has been used experimentally as an oral contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging¬†(MRI).
Acai products are available as juices, powders, tablets, and¬†capsules.
","
Very little research has been done in people on the health effects of acai¬†products.
","
There‚Äôs no definitive scientific evidence based on studies in people to support the use of acai for any health-related¬†purpose.
No independent studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals that substantiate claims that acai alone promotes rapid weight loss. Researchers who investigated the safety profile of an acai-fortified juice in rats observed that there were no body weight changes in animals given the juice compared with animals that didn‚Äôt receive¬†it.
A preliminary study suggested that eating acai fruit pulp might reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels in overweight¬†people.
Laboratory studies have focused on acai‚Äôs potential antioxidant properties, and a juice blend with acai as the main ingredient has been shown to have an antioxidant effect in people. (Antioxidants are substances that may protect cells against certain types of¬†damage.)
","
There is little reliable information about the safety of acai as a supplement. It is widely consumed as an edible fruit or as a¬†juice.
Consuming acai might affect MRI test results. If you use acai products and are scheduled for an MRI, check with your health care¬†provider.

1,Aloe Vera,"
Common Names:¬†
  aloe vera, aloe, burn plant, lily of the desert, elephant‚Äôs¬†gall","
Aloe vera‚Äôs use can be traced back 6,000 years to early Egypt, where the plant was depicted on stone carvings. Known as the ‚Äúplant of immortality,‚Äù aloe was presented as a funeral gift to¬†pharaohs.
Historically, aloe vera has been used for a variety of purposes, including treatment of wounds, hair loss, and hemorrhoids; it has also been used as a¬†laxative.
Two substances from aloe vera, the clear gel and the yellow latex, are used in health products today. Aloe gel is primarily used topically (applied to the skin) as a remedy for skin conditions such as burns, frostbite, psoriasis, and cold sores, but it may also be taken orally (by mouth) for conditions including osteoarthritis, bowel diseases, and fever. Aloe latex is taken orally, usually for¬†constipation.
","
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to show whether aloe vera is helpful for most of the purposes for which people use¬†it.
","
Aloe latex contains strong laxative compounds. Products made with aloe were at one time regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives. In 2002, the FDA required that all OTC aloe laxative products be removed from the U.S. market or reformulated because the companies that manufactured them did not provide the safety data necessary for continued¬†approval.
There‚Äôs some evidence that the topical use of aloe products might be helpful for symptoms of certain conditions such as psoriasis and certain¬†rashes.
There‚Äôs not enough high-quality scientific evidence to show whether topical use of aloe helps to heal¬†wounds.
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support aloe vera for any of its other¬†uses.
","
Use of topical aloe vera is likely to be¬†safe.
A 2-year National Toxicology Program study on oral consumption of nondecolorized whole leaf extract of aloe vera found clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and female rats, based on tumors of the large intestine. Another study in rats showed that decolorized whole leaf aloe vera did not cause harmful effects. This suggests that a component called aloin, most of which is removed by the decolorization process, may be responsible for the tumors seen in rats fed nondecolorized whole leaf aloe vera. More information, including what products are actually in the marketplace and how individuals use different types of aloe vera products, is needed to determine the potential risks to¬†humans.
Abdominal cramps and diarrhea have been reported with oral use of aloe latex. Also, because aloe latex is a laxative, it may reduce the absorption and therefore the effectiveness of some drugs that are taken¬†orally.
People with diabetes who use glucose-lowering medication should be cautious if also taking aloe orally because aloe may lower blood glucose¬†levels.
There have been a few reported cases of acute hepatitis in people who took aloe vera orally. However, the evidence is not¬†definitive.

2,Asian Ginseng,"
Common Names:¬†
  Asian ginseng, Chinese ginseng, Korean ginseng, Asiatic ginseng, Oriental¬†ginseng","
Asian ginseng is native to the Far East, including China and Korea, and has been used for health-related purposes for at least 2,000 years. Asian ginseng is one of several types of ginseng (another is American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius). The terms red ginseng and white ginseng refer to Asian ginseng roots prepared in two different ways. The herb called Siberian ginseng or eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is not related to true¬†ginseng.
In traditional Chinese medicine, Asian ginseng was used as a tonic that was believed to replenish energy. Today, Asian ginseng is used as a dietary supplement to improve general well-being, physical stamina, and concentration; stimulate immune function; slow the aging process; and relieve various health problems such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disorders, depression, anxiety, erectile dysfunction, and menopausal hot¬†flashes.
The root of Asian ginseng contains chemical components called ginsenosides (or panaxosides) that are thought to contribute to the herb‚Äôs claimed health-related¬†properties.
","
There have been many studies of Asian ginseng in people, but few have been high quality. Therefore, our understanding of Asian ginseng‚Äôs health effects is¬†limited.
","
There‚Äôs currently no conclusive evidence supporting any health benefits of Asian¬†ginseng.
","
Short-term use of Asian ginseng in recommended amounts appears to be safe for most people. However, questions have been raised about its long-term safety, and some experts recommend against its use by infants, children, and women who are pregnant or¬†breastfeeding.
The most common side effects of ginseng are headaches, sleep problems, and digestive¬†problems.
Some evidence suggests that Asian ginseng might affect blood sugar and blood pressure. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, consult your health care provider before using Asian¬†ginseng.
The risk of interactions between ginseng and medications is believed to be low, but there are uncertainties about whether ginseng might interact with certain medications, such as the anticoagulant (blood thinner) warfarin (Coumadin). If you‚Äôre taking medication, consult your health care provider before using Asian¬†ginseng.

3,Astragalus,"
Common Names:¬†
  astragalus, bei qi, huang qi, ogi, hwanggi, milk¬†vetch","
Astragalus has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine in combination with other herbs, such as ginseng, dong quai, and¬†licorice.
There are more than 2,000 species of¬†astragalus.
Astragalus has been used as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including for diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, upper respiratory infections, heart disease, hepatitis, fibromyalgia, and as an adjunctive therapy for¬†cancer.
The root of the astragalus plant is put in soups, teas, extracts, or¬†capsules.
","
There are no high-quality studies in people of astragalus for any health¬†conditions.
","
Patients with nephrotic syndrome (health problems related to kidney damage) are susceptible to infections. A 2012 research review found that taking astragalus granules may be associated with a lower risk of infections in children with nephrotic syndrome. However, the review concluded that the studies were poor¬†quality.
People with diabetic nephropathy (a type of kidney disease) who received an intravenous drip of astragalus over a period of 2 to 6 weeks did better on some measures of kidney function, compared to people who didn‚Äôt get astragalus, according to a 2011 analysis of 25 studies. However, most of the trials involved were poor¬†quality.
There‚Äôs weak evidence that astragalus may help heart function in some patients with viral myocarditis (an infection of the heart), a 2013 research review¬†showed.
Because of limitations in the studies, a 2013 research review on the effects of astragalus on fatty liver disease, which causes fat to build up in liver cells, couldn‚Äôt determine whether astragalus¬†helps.
An astragalus-based herbal formula didn‚Äôt extend the life of patients with advanced lung cancer, a small 2009 trial reported. The study was supported in part by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health¬†(NCCIH).
","
Astragalus is considered safe for many adults. The most commonly reported side effects are diarrhea and other mild gastrointestinal effects. However, it may affect blood sugar levels and blood pressure and be risky for people with certain health problems, such as blood disorders, diabetes, or¬†hypertension.
Astragalus may interact with medications that suppress the immune system, such as drugs taken by organ transplant recipients and some cancer¬†patients.
Some astragalus species, usually not found in dietary supplements, can be toxic. Several species that grow in the United States contain the neurotoxin swainsonine and have caused ‚Äúlocoweed‚Äù poisoning in animals. Other species contain potentially toxic levels of¬†selenium.

4,Bilberry,"
Common Names:¬†
  bilberry, European blueberry, whortleberry,¬†huckleberry","
The bilberry bush is a relative of the blueberry and is native to many areas, including the Rocky Mountains and regions of Europe and¬†Asia.
Its berries and leaves have been used for medicinal purposes since the Middle Ages for a variety of conditions, including diarrhea, scurvy, infections, burns, and diabetes. During World War II, British pilots ate bilberry jam, thinking it would improve their night¬†vision.
Today, bilberry is used as a dietary supplement for cardiovascular conditions, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, eye problems, diabetes, and other¬†conditions.
Bilberry extract is sold in tablets, capsules, and drops, and the berries are sold dried and as a powder. The leaves are made into¬†teas.
","
We have very few high-quality clinical trials (studies in people) of bilberry¬†supplements.
","
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bilberry for any health¬†conditions.
Researchers are interested in bilberry in large part because its berries have a high concentration of antioxidants called anthocyanins, which some studies suggest may have health¬†benefits.

5,Bitter Orange,"
Common Names:¬†
  bitter orange, Seville orange, sour orange, zhi¬†shi","
Native to eastern Africa and tropical Asia, bitter orange now is grown throughout the Mediterranean region and elsewhere, including California and¬†Florida.
Bitter orange has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and by indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest for constipation. Amazonian natives also used it for nausea and¬†indigestion.
Today, people use various bitter orange products as a dietary supplement for heartburn, loss of appetite, nasal congestion, and weight loss. It is also applied to the skin for pain, bruises, and bed¬†sores.
Bitter orange, used in some weight-loss products, contains synephrine, which is similar to the main chemical in the herb ephedra. Ephedra is banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because it raises blood pressure and is linked to heart attack and¬†stroke.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) placed synephrine (bitter orange) on its current list of banned¬†drugs.
The fruit, peel, flower, and oil are used and can be taken by mouth in tablets and capsules. Bitter orange oil can be applied to the¬†skin.
","
Only a few studies have investigated the usefulness of bitter orange as a dietary supplement for health purposes in¬†people.
","
Applying bitter orange oil to the skin may help with ringworm, jock itch, and athlete‚Äôs foot¬†infections.
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bitter orange for other health¬†purposes.

7,Butterbur,"
Common Names:¬†
  butterbur, petasites, purple butterbur. There are also several standardized butterbur extracts, such as¬†Petadolex.","
Butterbur is a shrub that grows in Europe and parts of Asia and North America, typically in wet, marshy ground. The name, butterbur, is attributed to the traditional use of its large leaves to wrap butter in warm¬†weather.
In the Middle Ages, butterbur was used for plague and fever, and in the 17th century it was used to treat cough, asthma, and skin wounds. More recently, it has been used for urinary tract symptoms, stomach upset, headaches including migraines, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and other¬†conditions.
Commercial butterbur products that contain extracts from the root, rhizome (underground stem), or leaves of the plant are available. Raw, unprocessed butterbur products, such as teas, should not be used because they contain harmful¬†substances.
","
There have been a few studies of butterbur for migraines and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in people, so we have some knowledge of its effects on these two¬†conditions.
","
Based on two high-quality studies, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society have endorsed the use of a butterbur extract made from underground parts of the plant, like the root or rhizome, to reduce the frequency of¬†migraines.
Some studies of butterbur root or leaf extracts suggest that they may be helpful for symptoms of hay fever (allergic¬†rhinitis).
Butterbur has not been proven to be helpful for allergic skin reactions or¬†asthma.
","
The raw, unprocessed butterbur plant contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs can cause liver damage and can result in serious illness. Only butterbur products that have been processed to remove PAs and are labeled or certified as PA-free should be¬†used.
Several studies, including a few studies of children and adolescents, have reported that PA-free butterbur products are safe and well tolerated when taken by mouth in recommended doses for up to 16 weeks. The safety of longer-term use has not been¬†established.
Butterbur is usually well tolerated but can cause side effects such as belching, headache, itchy eyes, diarrhea, breathing difficulties, fatigue, and¬†drowsiness.
Butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and¬†daisies.
Butterbur should only be given to children under the supervision of a qualified health¬†practitioner.

13,Cranberry,"
Common Names:¬†
  cranberry, American cranberry,¬†bearberry","
Cranberry is a native evergreen shrub that grows throughout North¬†America.
Historically, cranberry fruits or leaves were used for bladder, stomach, and liver disorders, as well as diabetes, wounds, and other¬†conditions.
Today, cranberry is used as a dietary supplement primarily for urinary tract infections¬†(UTIs).
The berries are used in beverages and food. They are also made into dietary supplements in the form of extracts, powder, capsules, and¬†tablets.
","
There have been a lot of studies in people of cranberry for UTIs, but there‚Äôs very little high quality recent research on cranberry for other¬†conditions.
","
There‚Äôs mixed evidence that cranberry can help to prevent UTIs.

In a 2016 year-long study of 147 women living in nursing homes, taking two daily cranberry capsules decreased bacteria levels in their urine in the first 6 months of the study, but didn‚Äôt decrease their frequency of UTIs over the year of the study, compared to taking a placebo. The two capsules together contained as much proanthocyanidin, a compound that is believed to protect against bacteria, as 20 ounces of cranberry¬†juice.
A 2012 research review of 13 clinical trials suggested that cranberry may help reduce the risk of UTIs in certain groups, including women with recurrent UTIs, children, and people who use cranberry-containing products more than twice¬†daily.
A 2012 research review of 24 clinical trials concluded that cranberry juice and supplements don‚Äôt prevent UTIs but many of the studies were poor¬†quality.


Cranberry hasn‚Äôt been shown to be effective as a treatment for an existing¬†UTI.
NCCIH-supported research is looking at the possible effects of cranberry on cancer-related anemia and tumor¬†cells.
","
Drinking cranberry juice appears to be safe, although large amounts can cause stomach upset and may over time increase the risk of kidney¬†stones.
Large doses of cranberry may alter levels of warfarin, an anticoagulant¬†(blood-thinner).

Common Names:¬†
  dandelion, lion‚Äôs tooth,¬†blowball","
Dandelion greens are edible and are a rich source of vitamin A. Dandelion has been used in traditional medical systems, including Native American, traditional Chinese, and traditional Arabic¬†medicine.
Dandelion has a long history of use for problems of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Today, dandelion as a dietary supplement is used as a blood ‚Äútonic,‚Äù as a diuretic, for minor digestive problems, and for other¬†purposes.
The leaves and roots of the dandelion, or the whole plant, are used fresh or dried in capsules or extracts. As a food, dandelion is used as a salad green and in soups, wine, and¬†teas.

15,Echinacea,"
Common Names:¬†
  echinacea, purple coneflower, coneflower, American¬†coneflower","
There are nine known species of echinacea, all of which are native to North America. They were used by Native Americans of the Great Plains region as traditional¬†medicines.
Echinacea is used as a dietary supplement for the common cold and other infections, based on the idea that it might stimulate the immune system to more effectively fight infection. Echinacea preparations have been used topically (applied to the skin) for wounds and skin¬†problems.
The roots and above-ground parts of the echinacea plant are used fresh or dried to make teas, squeezed (expressed) juice, extracts, capsules and tablets, and preparations for external use. Several species of echinacea, most commonly Echinacea purpurea or Echinacea angustifolia, may be included in dietary¬†supplements.
","
Many studies have been done on echinacea and the common cold. Much less research has been done on the use of echinacea for other health¬†purposes.
","
Taking echinacea after you catch a cold has not been shown to shorten the time that you‚Äôll be¬†sick.
Taking echinacea while you‚Äôre well may slightly reduce your chances of catching a cold. However, the evidence on this point isn‚Äôt completely certain. Currently, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research to identify the active constituents in echinacea and to study the effects on the human immune system of substances in bacteria that live within echinacea¬†plants.
","
There are many different echinacea products. They may contain different species of plants or different parts of the plant, be manufactured in different ways, and have other ingredients in addition to echinacea. Most of these products have not been tested in¬†people.
For most people, short-term oral (by mouth) use of echinacea is probably safe; the safety of long-term use is¬†uncertain.
The most common side effects of echinacea are digestive tract symptoms, such as nausea or stomach¬†pain.
Some people have allergic reactions to echinacea, which may be severe. Some children participating in a clinical trial of echinacea developed rashes, which may have been caused by an allergic reaction. People with atopy (a genetic tendency toward allergic reactions) may be more likely to have an allergic reaction when taking¬†echinacea.
Current evidence indicates that the risk of interactions between echinacea supplements and most medications is¬†low.

16,Ephedra,"
Common Names:¬†
  ephedra, Chinese ephedra, ma¬†huang","
Ephedra is an evergreen shrub-like plant native to central Asia, and Mongolia; it also grows in the southwestern United¬†States.
People have used ephedra for centuries in China for colds, fever, flu, headaches, asthma, nasal congestion, and¬†wheezing.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (compounds found in some ephedra species) in the United States in 2004. It was an ingredient in some dietary supplements marketed for weight loss, increased energy, and enhanced athletic¬†performance.
The dried stems and leaves of the ephedra plant have been used to create capsules, tablets, extracts, and¬†teas.
","
A large amount of research led to ephedrine alkaloids becoming main oral asthma medications in the 1940s and 1950s. Ephedra also has been used as a weight-loss agent and energy enhancer for athletic performance. However, the increasing number of reported adverse events caused the FDA to ban dietary supplements that contain ephedrine¬†alkaloids.
","
According to the FDA, there is little evidence of ephedra‚Äôs effectiveness, except for short-term weight loss. However, the increased risk of heart problems and stroke outweighs any¬†benefits.
","
The FDA banned the U.S. sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. It found that these supplements had an unreasonable risk of injury or illness‚Äîparticularly cardiovascular complications‚Äîand a risk of death. The ban does not apply to traditional Chinese herbal¬†remedies.
Using ephedra may worsen many health conditions such as heart disease and kidney disease. Ephedra has been associated with stroke. It also may contribute to increased blood sugar¬†levels.
Ephedra may intensify or cause seizures in people with seizure¬†disorders.
Taking ephedra may also cause anxiety, dizziness, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, headache, irritation of the stomach, nausea, psychosis, restlessness, sleep problems, and tremors. Some of these side effects may be associated with long-term use of¬†ephedra.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and children should avoid taking¬†ephedra.
Ephedra use may lead to serious health problems when used with other dietary supplements or¬†medicines.
Combining ephedra with caffeine increases the risk of potentially serious side¬†effects.

17,European Elder (Elderberry),"
Common Names:¬†
  European elder, black elder, elderberry, elder flower,¬†sambucus","
European elder is a tree native to Europe and parts of Asia and Africa, and it also grows in the United States. The name ‚Äúelder‚Äù comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ‚Äúaeld,‚Äù meaning fire. The terms ‚Äúelder flower‚Äù and ‚Äúelderberry‚Äù may refer to either European elder or a different herb called American elder. This fact sheet focuses only on European¬†elder.
Various parts of the elder tree, including the bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots, have long been used in traditional¬†medicine.
Currently, elderberry and elder flower are used as dietary supplements for flu, colds, constipation, and other¬†conditions.
The dried flowers (elder flower) and the dried ripe or fresh berries (elderberry) of the European elder tree are used in teas, extracts, and¬†capsules.
","
A small number of studies in people have evaluated European elder for various health conditions. Some of these studies used products that included several ingredients, so the actions of individual ingredients are¬†unclear.
","
Although some preliminary research indicates that elderberry may relieve flu symptoms, the evidence is not strong enough to support its use for this¬†purpose.
A few studies have suggested that combination products containing elder flower and other herbs might be helpful for sinusitis, but because the products contain multiple ingredients, it‚Äôs unclear what role, if any, elder flower plays in their¬†effects.
There‚Äôs not enough information to show whether elder flower and elderberry are helpful for any other¬†purposes.
Researchers funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are studying the antioxidant effects of extracts from elderberry and their possible relevance to the body‚Äôs defense against¬†infection.
","
The leaves, stems, raw and unripe berries, and other plant parts of the elder tree contain a toxic substance and, if not properly prepared, may cause nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea. Because the substance may also be present in the flower, consuming large amounts of the flower might be harmful; however, no illnesses caused by elder flower have been¬†reported.

European mistletoe grows on several types of common trees such as apple, oak, pine, and elm trees. Where the term ‚Äúmistletoe‚Äù is used in this fact sheet, it refers to European mistletoe. European mistletoe is different from American mistletoe, the type of mistletoe that grows in the United States and is used as a holiday¬†decoration.
Mistletoe has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for a variety of conditions including seizures, headaches, and arthritis. Today, mistletoe is used in Europe as a treatment for¬†cancer.
The berries, leaves, and stems of mistletoe are used to make extracts, which are usually given by injection under the skin. Mistletoe may also be taken orally (by mouth) as a dietary supplement. In Europe, mistletoe extracts that are given by injection are sold as prescription drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. In the United States, the use of injectable mistletoe extracts is permitted only in clinical¬†trials.
","
Although mistletoe has been studied for cancer, its effects are not well understood because much of the research on it has been of poor¬†quality.
","
There have been clinical trials of mistletoe for cancer, mostly in Europe. Although some trials indicated that mistletoe improved survival or quality of life, almost all of the trials had major weaknesses that raise doubts about their findings. These weaknesses have included small numbers of patients, incomplete data, lack of information about the dose of mistletoe, and problems with the design of the¬†studies.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Cancer Institute have completed a preliminary trial to evaluate the safety of injected European mistletoe extract in combination with a cancer drug in patients with advanced cancer. It showed that patients could tolerate the herb/drug combination and provided other information that may be helpful in the design of future studies to evaluate mistletoe‚Äôs¬†effectiveness.
Mistletoe is not a proven cancer treatment. It should not be used outside of clinical¬†trials.

Common Name:¬†
  garlic","
Garlic is the edible bulb from a plant in the lily family. It was traditionally used for health purposes by people in many parts of the world, including the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Japanese, and Native¬†Americans.
Currently, garlic is used as a dietary supplement for many purposes, including high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and the common cold, as well as in attempts to prevent cancer and other¬†diseases.
Fresh garlic, garlic powder, and garlic oil are used to flavor foods. Garlic dietary supplements are sold as tablets or capsules. Garlic oil may be used topically (applied to the¬†skin).
","
A great deal of research has been done on garlic, but much of it consists of small, preliminary, or low-quality¬†studies.
","
There‚Äôs conflicting evidence about whether garlic lowers blood cholesterol levels. If it does, the effect is small, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the so-called ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol that‚Äôs linked to increased heart disease risk) may not be reduced at¬†all.
Garlic may be helpful for high blood pressure, but the evidence is¬†weak.
Some studies indicate that certain groups of people who eat more garlic may be less likely to develop certain cancers, such as stomach and colon cancers. However, garlic in dietary supplement form has not been shown to help reduce the risk of these cancers. The National Cancer Institute recognizes garlic as one of several vegetables with potential anticancer properties but does not recommend using garlic dietary supplements for cancer¬†prevention.
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to show whether garlic is helpful for the common¬†cold.
","
Garlic is probably safe for most people in the amounts usually eaten in¬†foods.
Side effects include breath and body odor, heartburn, and upset stomach. These side effects can be more noticeable with raw garlic. Some people have allergic reactions to¬†garlic.
Taking garlic may increase the risk of bleeding. If you take an anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as warfarin (Coumadin) or if you need surgery, tell your health care provider if you‚Äôre taking or planning to take garlic dietary¬†supplements.
Garlic has been found to interfere with the effectiveness of some drugs, including saquinavir, a drug used to treat HIV¬†infection.

26,Goldenseal,"
Common Names:¬†
  goldenseal, yellow¬†root","
Goldenseal is a plant native to North America. Overharvesting and loss of habitat have decreased the availability of wild goldenseal, but the plant is now grown commercially in the United States, especially in the Blue Ridge¬†Mountains.
Historically, Native Americans used goldenseal for skin disorders, ulcers, fevers, and other conditions. European settlers adopted it as a medicinal plant, using it for a variety of¬†conditions.
Currently, goldenseal is used as a dietary supplement for colds and other respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), ulcers, and digestive upsets such as diarrhea and constipation. It is also used as a mouthwash for sore gums and as an eyewash for eye inflammation, and it is applied to the skin for rashes and other skin¬†problems.
The roots of goldenseal are dried and used to make teas, extracts, tablets, or capsules. Goldenseal is often combined with echinacea in commercial¬†products.
","
Very little research has been done on the health effects of¬†goldenseal.
","
The scientific evidence does not support the use of goldenseal for any health-related¬†purpose.
Berberine, a substance found in goldenseal, has been studied for heart failure, diarrhea, infections, and other health conditions. However, when people take goldenseal orally (by mouth), very little berberine may be absorbed by the body or enter the bloodstream, so study results on berberine may not apply to¬†goldenseal.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research to study how goldenseal may act against bacteria and to develop research-grade goldenseal for use in human¬†studies.

Since ancient Greece people have used grapes, grape leaves, and sap for health purposes. Grape seed extract was developed in the¬†1970s.
Today, grape seed extract is used as a dietary supplement for various conditions, including for venous insufficiency (when veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart), to promote wound healing, and to reduce¬†inflammation.
Grape seed extract contains the antioxidant compound oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC), which has been studied for a variety of health¬†conditions.
OPCs are found in extracts of grape skin and seeds, which are by-products of the wine industry. Grape seed extract is available in capsules and tablets and as a¬†liquid.
","
There are a few well-controlled studies of people using grape seed extract for health¬†conditions.

Some studies suggest that compounds in grape seed extract may reduce edema (swelling) and help with symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, but the evidence isn‚Äôt¬†strong.
Grape seed extract may have some heart benefits, including lowering systolic blood pressure and heart rate. The lower heart rate may cause the decrease in systolic blood pressure. The extract had no effect on lipid levels such as cholesterol or C-reactive protein, an indication of inflammation in your¬†arteries.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is supporting preliminary research on grape seed extract for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and also for hereditary hemochromatosis, when the body‚Äôs iron levels are too high.

Current uses of green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement include improving mental alertness, relieving digestive symptoms and headaches, and promoting weight loss. Green tea and its extracts, such as one of its components, EGCG, have been studied for their possible protective effects against heart disease and¬†cancer.
Green tea is consumed as a beverage. It is also sold in liquid extracts, capsules, and tablets and is sometimes used in topical products (intended to be applied to the¬†skin).
","
Although many studies have been done on green tea and its extracts, definite conclusions cannot yet be reached on whether green tea is helpful for most of the purposes for which it is¬†used.
","
There‚Äôs evidence that green tea enhances mental alertness, as would be expected because of its caffeine¬†content.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a specific green tea extract ointment as a prescription drug for treating genital¬†warts.
Studies of green tea and cancer in people have had inconsistent results. The National Cancer Institute does not recommend for or against using green tea to reduce the risk of any type of¬†cancer.
Very few long-term studies have investigated the effects of tea on heart disease risk. However, the limited evidence currently available suggests that both green and black tea might have beneficial effects on some heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure and¬†cholesterol.
Green tea extracts haven‚Äôt been shown to produce a meaningful weight loss in overweight or obese adults. They also haven‚Äôt been shown to help people maintain a weight¬†loss.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research on green tea and its extracts, including studies of the effects of high doses of tea components on the liver, whether substances in green tea can be helpful for iron overload disease, and the safety of a component of green tea in people who are¬†HIV-positive.

In most studies of hawthorn for heart failure, no serious safety problems have been reported. However, in one study, patients taking hawthorn were more likely than those taking a placebo (an inactive substance) to have their heart failure get worse soon after the study started. The reason for this is not clear, but one possibility is that hawthorn might have interacted with drugs the patients were¬†taking.

Horse chestnut trees are native to the Balkan Peninsula (which includes such countries as Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia), but are grown¬†worldwide.
Historically, horse chestnut seed extract was used for joint pain, bladder and gastrointestinal problems, fever, and leg¬†cramps.
Today, people use horse chestnut extract as a dietary supplement for chronic venous insufficiency (when the veins of the lower leg are unable to send blood back toward the heart), hemorrhoids, and swelling after surgery. Preparations made from the tree‚Äôs bark are applied to skin¬†sores.
Usable parts of the plant include the seed, bark, and leaf, but seed extracts are most¬†common.

34,Licorice Root,"
Common Names:¬†
  licorice root, licorice, liquorice, sweet root, gan cao, gan-zao, Chinese¬†licorice","
Most licorice root grows in Greece, Turkey, and Asia. Anise oil is often used instead of licorice root to flavor licorice¬†candy.
Centuries ago, licorice root was used in Greece, China, and Egypt for stomach inflammation and upper respiratory problems. Licorice root also has been used as a¬†sweetener.
Today, people use licorice root as a dietary supplement for digestive problems, menopausal symptoms, cough, and bacterial and viral infections. People also use it as a¬†shampoo.
Licorice is harvested from the plants‚Äô roots and underground stems. Licorice supplements are available as capsules, tablets, and liquid¬†extracts.
","
A number of studies of licorice root in people have been published, but not enough to support the use for any specific health¬†condition.
","
Glycyrrhizin‚Äîa compound found in licorice root‚Äîhas been tested in a few clinical trials in hepatitis C patients, but there‚Äôs currently not enough evidence to determine if it‚Äôs helpful. Laboratory studies done in Japan (where an injectable glycyrrhizin compound is used in people with chronic hepatitis C who do not respond to conventional treatment) suggest that glycyrrhizin may have some effect against hepatitis¬†C.
There‚Äôs some evidence that topical licorice extract may improve skin rash symptoms, such as redness, swelling, and¬†itching.
A Finnish study of mothers and their young children suggested that eating a lot of actual licorice root during pregnancy may harm a child‚Äôs developing brain, leading to reasoning and behavioral issues, such as attention problems, rule-breaking, and¬†aggression.
Studies of licorice root extracts in people for cavities, mouth ulcers, and oral yeast infections have returned mixed¬†results.
","
In large amounts and with long-term use, licorice root can cause high blood pressure and low potassium levels, which could lead to heart and muscle problems. Some side effects are thought to be due to a chemical called glycyrrhizic acid. Licorice that has had this chemical removed (called DGL for deglycyrrhizinated licorice) may not have the same degree of side¬†effects.
Taking licorice root containing glycyrrhizinic acid with medications that reduce potassium levels such as diuretics might be bad for your¬†heart.
Pregnant women should avoid using licorice root as a supplement or consuming large amounts of it as¬†food.

Common Names:¬†
  milk thistle, Mary thistle, holy¬†thistle.","
Milk thistle is native to southern Europe, southern Russia, Asia Minor, and northern Africa. It also grows in North and South America and South¬†Australia.
Silymarin is considered to be the main component of milk thistle seeds, but the terms ‚Äúmilk thistle‚Äù and ‚Äúsilymarin‚Äù often are used¬†interchangeably.
Historically, people have used milk thistle for liver disorders, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and gallbladder¬†problems.
Silymarin is the most commonly used herbal supplement in the United States for liver¬†problems.
Milk thistle products are available as capsules, powders, and¬†extracts.
","
We know little about whether milk thistle is effective in people, as only a few well-designed clinical studies have been¬†conducted.
","
Results from clinical trials of milk thistle for liver diseases have been mixed, and two rigorously designed studies found no¬†benefit.
The 2008 Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), found that hepatitis C patients who used silymarin had fewer and milder symptoms of liver disease and somewhat better quality of life but no change in virus activity or liver¬†inflammation.
A 2012 clinical trial, cofunded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, showed that two higher-than-usual doses of silymarin were no better than placebo for chronic hepatitis C in people who had not responded to standard antiviral¬†treatment.
Results from a 2013 clinical study suggest that milk thistle may enhance standard treatment in young people with a particular form of anemia (Cooley‚Äôs¬†anemia).
","
In clinical trials, milk thistle appears to be well tolerated in recommended doses. Occasionally, people report various gastrointestinal side¬†effects.
Milk thistle may produce allergic reactions, which tend to be more common among people who are allergic to plants in the same family (for example, ragweed, chrysanthemum, marigold, and¬†daisy).
Compounds in milk thistle may lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes should use¬†caution.

Both peppermint leaves and the essential oil from peppermint have been used for health purposes. (Essential oils are very concentrated oils containing substances that give a plant its characteristic odor or flavor.) Peppermint is a common flavoring agent in foods, and peppermint oil is used to create a pleasant fragrance in soaps and cosmetics.
Mint has been used for health purposes for several thousand years. It is mentioned in records from ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. However, peppermint was not recognized as a distinct kind of mint until the 1700s.
Today, peppermint is used as a dietary supplement for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other digestive problems, the common cold, headaches, and other conditions. Peppermint oil is also used topically (applied to the skin) for headache, muscle aches, itching, and other problems. Peppermint leaf is available in teas, capsules, and as a liquid extract. Peppermint oil is available as liquid solutions and in capsules, including enteric-coated capsules.","A small amount of research has been conducted on peppermint oil, primarily focusing on IBS.
Very little research has been done on peppermint leaf.","Peppermint oil has been studied most extensively for IBS. Results from several studies indicate that peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules may improve IBS symptoms.

Peppermint oil has been used topically for tension headaches and a limited amount of evidence suggests that it might be helpful for this purpose.
There’s not enough evidence to allow any conclusions to be reached about whether peppermint oil is helpful for nausea, the common cold, or other conditions.
There’s not enough evidence to show whether peppermint leaf is helpful for any condition.","Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.
Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.
Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.
Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.

Historically, red clover was used for a variety of conditions including asthma, whooping cough, cancer, and gout. Today, isoflavone extracts from red clover are most often used as dietary supplements for menopausal symptoms, high cholesterol, or osteoporosis.
The flowering tops of the red clover plant are used to prepare extracts available in tablets or capsules, as well as in teas and liquid forms.","There have been several studies of red clover in people, but their results haven’t provided clear evidence of any beneficial effects.","Red clover has not been clearly shown to be helpful for any health condition.

42,Red Yeast Rice: An Introduction,,"
Some red yeast rice products contain substantial amounts of monacolin K, which is chemically identical to the active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. These products may lower blood cholesterol levels and can cause the same types of side effects and drug interactions as¬†lovastatin.
Other red yeast rice products contain little or no monacolin K. It is not known whether these products have any effect on blood cholesterol¬†levels.
Consumers have no way of knowing how much monacolin K is present in most red yeast rice products. The labels on these products usually state only the amount of red yeast rice that they contain, not the amount of monacolin¬†K.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that red yeast rice products that contain more than trace amounts of monacolin K are unapproved new drugs and cannot be sold legally as dietary¬†supplements.
Some red yeast rice products contain a contaminant called citrinin, which can cause kidney¬†failure.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe¬†care.
","Red yeast rice is made by culturing rice with various strains of the yeast Monascus purpureus. Some preparations of red yeast rice are used in food products in Chinese cuisine, including Peking duck. Others have been sold as dietary supplements to lower blood levels of cholesterol and related¬†lipids.","
The same types of side effects that can occur in patients taking lovastatin as a drug can also occur in patients who take red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K. Potential side effects include myopathy (muscle symptoms such as pain and weakness), rhabdomyolysis (a condition in which muscle fibers break down, releasing substances into the bloodstream that can harm the kidneys), and liver toxicity. Each of these three side effects has been reported in people who were taking red yeast¬†rice.
Red yeast rice supplements should not be used while pregnant or¬†breastfeeding.
Lovastatin can interact with a variety of drugs to increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis; these drugs include other cholesterol-lowering agents, certain antibiotics, the antidepressant nefazodone, drugs used to treat fungal infections, and drugs used to treat HIV infection. Red yeast rice containing monacolin K could interact with drugs in the same¬†way.
If the process of culturing red yeast rice is not carefully controlled, a substance called citrinin can form. Citrinin has been shown to cause kidney failure in experimental animals and genetic damage in human cells. In a 2011 analysis of red yeast rice products sold as dietary supplements, 4 of 11 products were found to contain this¬†contaminant.

People with bipolar disorder (an illness characterized by mood swings, from depression to mania) should not take SAMe for their depressive symptoms except under the supervision of a health care provider because SAMe may worsen symptoms of mania.
Although SAMe has been used to treat cholestasis during pregnancy, its safety during pregnancy has not been established.
SAMe may decrease the effects of levodopa (L-dopa), a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease. It’s also possible that SAMe might interact with drugs and dietary supplements that increase levels of serotonin (a chemical produced by nerve cells), such as antidepressants, L-tryptophan, and St. John’s wort.
There’s a theoretical concern about the use of SAMe by people who are immunocompromised (such as those who are HIV-positive). Immunocompromised people are at risk for Pneumocystis carinii infection, and SAMe enhances the growth of this microorganism.

46,Soy,"
Common Name:¬†
  soy","This fact sheet focuses on the use of soy by adults for health purposes.
Soy, a plant in the pea family, has been common in Asian diets for thousands of years. Soy is also present in modern Western diets as a food and food ingredient.
Soy products are used for menopausal symptoms, bone health, improving memory, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.
In addition to its food uses, soy is available in dietary supplements, in forms such as tablets, capsules, and powders. Soy supplements may contain soy protein, isoflavones (compounds that have effects in the body similar to those of the female hormone estrogen), or other soy components.","Although there have been many studies on soy products, there are still uncertainties about soy’s health effects.","Consuming soy protein in place of other proteins may lower levels of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol to a small extent.
Soy isoflavone supplements may help to reduce the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes, but the effect may be small.
It’s uncertain whether soy supplements can relieve cognitive problems associated with menopause.
Current evidence suggests that soy isoflavone mixtures do not slow bone loss in Western women during or after menopause.
Diets containing soy protein may slightly reduce blood pressure.
There’s not enough scientific evidence to determine whether soy supplements are effective for any other health uses.
Current National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-funded studies on soy and its components are investigating a variety of topics, including stroke outcomes, anti-inflammatory effects, and effects on diabetes.","Except for people with soy allergies, soy is believed to be safe when consumed in normal dietary amounts. However, the safety of long-term use of high doses of soy extracts has not been established.
The most common side effects of soy are digestive upsets, such as stomach pain and diarrhea.
Long-term use of soy isoflavone supplements might increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (a thickening of the lining of the uterus that may lead to cancer). Soy foods do not appear to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
Current evidence indicates that it’s safe for women who have had breast cancer or who are at risk for breast cancer to eat soy foods.

47,St. John's Wort,"
Common Names:¬†
  St. John‚Äôs wort, hypericum, Klamath weed,¬†goatweed","
St. John‚Äôs wort is a plant with yellow flowers that has been used in traditional European medicine as far back as the ancient Greeks. The name St. John‚Äôs wort apparently refers to John the Baptist, as the plant blooms around the time of the feast of St. John the Baptist in late¬†June.
Historically, St. John‚Äôs wort has been used for a variety of conditions, including kidney and lung ailments, insomnia, and depression, and to aid wound¬†healing.
Currently, St. John‚Äôs wort is most often used as a dietary supplement for depression. People also use it as a dietary supplement for other conditions, including menopausal symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is used topically for wound¬†healing.
The flowering tops of St. John‚Äôs wort are used to prepare teas, tablets, capsules, and liquid extracts. Topical preparations are also¬†available.
","
There has been extensive research on St. John‚Äôs wort, especially on its use for depression and on its interactions with medications. It has been clearly shown that St. John‚Äôs wort can interact in dangerous, sometimes life-threatening ways with a variety of¬†medicines.
","
The results of studies on the effectiveness of St. John‚Äôs wort for depression are mixed. For more information, see the NCCIH fact sheet St. John‚Äôs Wort and Depression.
St. John‚Äôs wort has also been studied for conditions other than depression. For some, such as ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, and quitting smoking, current evidence indicates that St. John‚Äôs wort is not helpful. For others, such as menopausal symptoms, premenstrual syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the evidence is¬†inconclusive.

St. John‚Äôs wort can weaken the effects of many medicines, including crucially important medicines such as

Antidepressants
Birth control¬†pills
Cyclosporine, which prevents the body from rejecting transplanted¬†organs
Digoxin, a heart¬†medication
Some HIV drugs including¬†indinavir
Some cancer medications including¬†irinotecan
Warfarin, an anticoagulant (blood¬†thinner).


Taking St. John‚Äôs wort with certain antidepressants or other drugs that affect serotonin, a substance produced by nerve cells, may lead to increased serotonin-related side effects, which may be potentially¬†serious.
St. John‚Äôs wort may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Other side effects can include anxiety, dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, headache, or sexual¬†dysfunction.

Currently, thunder god vine is used orally (by mouth) as a dietary supplement for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus. It is also used topically for rheumatoid arthritis.
Extracts are prepared from the roots of thunder god vine.",A small number of studies have evaluated oral thunder god vine for rheumatoid arthritis. Very little research has been done on thunder god vine for other health conditions or on topical use of this herb for rheumatoid arthritis.,"There have been only a few high-quality studies of oral thunder god vine for rheumatoid arthritis in people. These studies indicate that thunder god vine may improve some rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
Results from a small 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), which compared an extract of thunder god vine root with a conventional drug (sulfasalazine) for rheumatoid arthritis, found that participants’ symptoms (e.g., joint pain and swelling, inflammation) improved significantly more with thunder god vine than with the drug.
A study from China, published in 2014, compared thunder god vine to a conventional drug (methotrexate) and found that both were comparably helpful in relieving rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, and that the combination of the herb and the drug was better than either one alone.
There is not enough evidence to show whether thunder god vine is helpful for any health conditions other than rheumatoid arthritis or whether its topical use in rheumatoid arthritis has any benefits.","Thunder god vine may have side effects, including decreased bone mineral content (with long-term use), infertility, menstrual cycle changes, rashes, diarrhea, headache, and hair loss.

Today, turmeric is used as a dietary supplement for inflammation; arthritis; stomach, skin, liver, and gallbladder problems; cancer; and other¬†conditions.
Turmeric is a common spice and a major ingredient in curry powder. Its primary active ingredients, curcuminoids, are yellow and used to color foods and¬†cosmetics.
Turmeric‚Äôs underground stems (rhizomes) are dried and made into capsules, tablets, teas, or extracts. Turmeric powder is also made into a paste for skin¬†conditions.

Yohimbe is an evergreen tree native to western Africa. It has a compound called yohimbine in its bark. The bark is used to make extracts, tablets, and¬†capsules.
In parts of Africa, tea made from yohimbe bark has been used as an aphrodisiac (to increase sexual¬†desire).
Yohimbe is used as a dietary supplement for impotence, athletic performance, weight loss, chest pain, high blood pressure, diabetic neuropathy, and¬†more.
Yohimbine hydrochloride, a standardized form of yohimbine, is available in the United States as a prescription drug for erectile dysfunction. This is a different product than dietary supplements made from the bark of the¬†tree.
