Common Names:¬†
  acai,¬†a√ßa√≠","
The acai palm tree, native to tropical Central and South America, produces a deep purple fruit. The word ‚Äúacai,‚Äù which comes from a language of the native people of the region, means ‚Äúfruit that cries.‚Äù The acai fruit has long been an important food source for indigenous peoples of the Amazon¬†region.
Acai products have become popular in the United States, where they have been marketed for weight-loss and anti-aging¬†purposes.
The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against companies that marketed acai weight loss products in allegedly deceptive¬†ways.
Acai fruit pulp has been used experimentally as an oral contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging¬†(MRI).
Acai products are available as juices, powders, tablets, and¬†capsules.
","
Very little research has been done in people on the health effects of acai¬†products.
","
There‚Äôs no definitive scientific evidence based on studies in people to support the use of acai for any health-related¬†purpose.
No independent studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals that substantiate claims that acai alone promotes rapid weight loss. Researchers who investigated the safety profile of an acai-fortified juice in rats observed that there were no body weight changes in animals given the juice compared with animals that didn‚Äôt receive¬†it.
A preliminary study suggested that eating acai fruit pulp might reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels in overweight¬†people.
Laboratory studies have focused on acai‚Äôs potential antioxidant properties, and a juice blend with acai as the main ingredient has been shown to have an antioxidant effect in people. (Antioxidants are substances that may protect cells against certain types of¬†damage.)
","
There is little reliable information about the safety of acai as a supplement. It is widely consumed as an edible fruit or as a¬†juice.
Consuming acai might affect MRI test results. If you use acai products and are scheduled for an MRI, check with your health care¬†provider.

1,Aloe Vera,"
Common Names:¬†
  aloe vera, aloe, burn plant, lily of the desert, elephant‚Äôs¬†gall","
Aloe vera‚Äôs use can be traced back 6,000 years to early Egypt, where the plant was depicted on stone carvings. Known as the ‚Äúplant of immortality,‚Äù aloe was presented as a funeral gift to¬†pharaohs.
Historically, aloe vera has been used for a variety of purposes, including treatment of wounds, hair loss, and hemorrhoids; it has also been used as a¬†laxative.
Two substances from aloe vera, the clear gel and the yellow latex, are used in health products today. Aloe gel is primarily used topically (applied to the skin) as a remedy for skin conditions such as burns, frostbite, psoriasis, and cold sores, but it may also be taken orally (by mouth) for conditions including osteoarthritis, bowel diseases, and fever. Aloe latex is taken orally, usually for¬†constipation.
","
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to show whether aloe vera is helpful for most of the purposes for which people use¬†it.
","
Aloe latex contains strong laxative compounds. Products made with aloe were at one time regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives. In 2002, the FDA required that all OTC aloe laxative products be removed from the U.S. market or reformulated because the companies that manufactured them did not provide the safety data necessary for continued¬†approval.
There‚Äôs some evidence that the topical use of aloe products might be helpful for symptoms of certain conditions such as psoriasis and certain¬†rashes.
There‚Äôs not enough high-quality scientific evidence to show whether topical use of aloe helps to heal¬†wounds.
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support aloe vera for any of its other¬†uses.
","
Use of topical aloe vera is likely to be¬†safe.
A 2-year National Toxicology Program study on oral consumption of nondecolorized whole leaf extract of aloe vera found clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in male and female rats, based on tumors of the large intestine. Another study in rats showed that decolorized whole leaf aloe vera did not cause harmful effects. This suggests that a component called aloin, most of which is removed by the decolorization process, may be responsible for the tumors seen in rats fed nondecolorized whole leaf aloe vera. More information, including what products are actually in the marketplace and how individuals use different types of aloe vera products, is needed to determine the potential risks to¬†humans.
Abdominal cramps and diarrhea have been reported with oral use of aloe latex. Also, because aloe latex is a laxative, it may reduce the absorption and therefore the effectiveness of some drugs that are taken¬†orally.
People with diabetes who use glucose-lowering medication should be cautious if also taking aloe orally because aloe may lower blood glucose¬†levels.
There have been a few reported cases of acute hepatitis in people who took aloe vera orally. However, the evidence is not¬†definitive.

2,Asian Ginseng,"
Common Names:¬†
  Asian ginseng, Chinese ginseng, Korean ginseng, Asiatic ginseng, Oriental¬†ginseng","
Asian ginseng is native to the Far East, including China and Korea, and has been used for health-related purposes for at least 2,000 years. Asian ginseng is one of several types of ginseng (another is American ginseng, Panax quinquefolius). The terms red ginseng and white ginseng refer to Asian ginseng roots prepared in two different ways. The herb called Siberian ginseng or eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is not related to true¬†ginseng.
In traditional Chinese medicine, Asian ginseng was used as a tonic that was believed to replenish energy. Today, Asian ginseng is used as a dietary supplement to improve general well-being, physical stamina, and concentration; stimulate immune function; slow the aging process; and relieve various health problems such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disorders, depression, anxiety, erectile dysfunction, and menopausal hot¬†flashes.
The root of Asian ginseng contains chemical components called ginsenosides (or panaxosides) that are thought to contribute to the herb‚Äôs claimed health-related¬†properties.
","
There have been many studies of Asian ginseng in people, but few have been high quality. Therefore, our understanding of Asian ginseng‚Äôs health effects is¬†limited.
","
There‚Äôs currently no conclusive evidence supporting any health benefits of Asian¬†ginseng.
","
Short-term use of Asian ginseng in recommended amounts appears to be safe for most people. However, questions have been raised about its long-term safety, and some experts recommend against its use by infants, children, and women who are pregnant or¬†breastfeeding.
The most common side effects of ginseng are headaches, sleep problems, and digestive¬†problems.
Some evidence suggests that Asian ginseng might affect blood sugar and blood pressure. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, consult your health care provider before using Asian¬†ginseng.
The risk of interactions between ginseng and medications is believed to be low, but there are uncertainties about whether ginseng might interact with certain medications, such as the anticoagulant (blood thinner) warfarin (Coumadin). If you‚Äôre taking medication, consult your health care provider before using Asian¬†ginseng.

3,Astragalus,"
Common Names:¬†
  astragalus, bei qi, huang qi, ogi, hwanggi, milk¬†vetch","
Astragalus has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine in combination with other herbs, such as ginseng, dong quai, and¬†licorice.
There are more than 2,000 species of¬†astragalus.
Astragalus has been used as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including for diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, upper respiratory infections, heart disease, hepatitis, fibromyalgia, and as an adjunctive therapy for¬†cancer.
The root of the astragalus plant is put in soups, teas, extracts, or¬†capsules.
","
There are no high-quality studies in people of astragalus for any health¬†conditions.
","
Patients with nephrotic syndrome (health problems related to kidney damage) are susceptible to infections. A 2012 research review found that taking astragalus granules may be associated with a lower risk of infections in children with nephrotic syndrome. However, the review concluded that the studies were poor¬†quality.
People with diabetic nephropathy (a type of kidney disease) who received an intravenous drip of astragalus over a period of 2 to 6 weeks did better on some measures of kidney function, compared to people who didn‚Äôt get astragalus, according to a 2011 analysis of 25 studies. However, most of the trials involved were poor¬†quality.
There‚Äôs weak evidence that astragalus may help heart function in some patients with viral myocarditis (an infection of the heart), a 2013 research review¬†showed.
Because of limitations in the studies, a 2013 research review on the effects of astragalus on fatty liver disease, which causes fat to build up in liver cells, couldn‚Äôt determine whether astragalus¬†helps.
An astragalus-based herbal formula didn‚Äôt extend the life of patients with advanced lung cancer, a small 2009 trial reported. The study was supported in part by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health¬†(NCCIH).
","
Astragalus is considered safe for many adults. The most commonly reported side effects are diarrhea and other mild gastrointestinal effects. However, it may affect blood sugar levels and blood pressure and be risky for people with certain health problems, such as blood disorders, diabetes, or¬†hypertension.
Astragalus may interact with medications that suppress the immune system, such as drugs taken by organ transplant recipients and some cancer¬†patients.
Some astragalus species, usually not found in dietary supplements, can be toxic. Several species that grow in the United States contain the neurotoxin swainsonine and have caused ‚Äúlocoweed‚Äù poisoning in animals. Other species contain potentially toxic levels of¬†selenium.

4,Bilberry,"
Common Names:¬†
  bilberry, European blueberry, whortleberry,¬†huckleberry","
The bilberry bush is a relative of the blueberry and is native to many areas, including the Rocky Mountains and regions of Europe and¬†Asia.
Its berries and leaves have been used for medicinal purposes since the Middle Ages for a variety of conditions, including diarrhea, scurvy, infections, burns, and diabetes. During World War II, British pilots ate bilberry jam, thinking it would improve their night¬†vision.
Today, bilberry is used as a dietary supplement for cardiovascular conditions, diarrhea, urinary tract infections, eye problems, diabetes, and other¬†conditions.
Bilberry extract is sold in tablets, capsules, and drops, and the berries are sold dried and as a powder. The leaves are made into¬†teas.
","
We have very few high-quality clinical trials (studies in people) of bilberry¬†supplements.
","
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bilberry for any health¬†conditions.
Researchers are interested in bilberry in large part because its berries have a high concentration of antioxidants called anthocyanins, which some studies suggest may have health¬†benefits.
","
Bilberry fruit is considered safe when consumed in amounts typically found in foods, or as an extract in recommended doses for brief periods of¬†time.
Bilberry leaves may be unsafe when taken orally (by mouth) in high doses or for long periods of¬†time.

5,Bitter Orange,"
Common Names:¬†
  bitter orange, Seville orange, sour orange, zhi¬†shi","
Native to eastern Africa and tropical Asia, bitter orange now is grown throughout the Mediterranean region and elsewhere, including California and¬†Florida.
Bitter orange has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and by indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest for constipation. Amazonian natives also used it for nausea and¬†indigestion.
Today, people use various bitter orange products as a dietary supplement for heartburn, loss of appetite, nasal congestion, and weight loss. It is also applied to the skin for pain, bruises, and bed¬†sores.
Bitter orange, used in some weight-loss products, contains synephrine, which is similar to the main chemical in the herb ephedra. Ephedra is banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because it raises blood pressure and is linked to heart attack and¬†stroke.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) placed synephrine (bitter orange) on its current list of banned¬†drugs.
The fruit, peel, flower, and oil are used and can be taken by mouth in tablets and capsules. Bitter orange oil can be applied to the¬†skin.
","
Only a few studies have investigated the usefulness of bitter orange as a dietary supplement for health purposes in¬†people.
","
Applying bitter orange oil to the skin may help with ringworm, jock itch, and athlete‚Äôs foot¬†infections.
There‚Äôs not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bitter orange for other health¬†purposes.
","
There are case reports of healthy people experiencing fainting, heart attack, and stroke after taking bitter orange alone or with caffeine. However, evidence regarding the effects of bitter orange (alone or combined with other substances, such as caffeine and green tea) on the heart and cardiovascular system are¬†inconclusive.
Because products that contain bitter orange may be unsafe, pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid¬†them.

Butterbur is a shrub that grows in Europe and parts of Asia and North America, typically in wet, marshy ground. The name, butterbur, is attributed to the traditional use of its large leaves to wrap butter in warm¬†weather.
In the Middle Ages, butterbur was used for plague and fever, and in the 17th century it was used to treat cough, asthma, and skin wounds. More recently, it has been used for urinary tract symptoms, stomach upset, headaches including migraines, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and other¬†conditions.
Commercial butterbur products that contain extracts from the root, rhizome (underground stem), or leaves of the plant are available. Raw, unprocessed butterbur products, such as teas, should not be used because they contain harmful¬†substances.
","
There have been a few studies of butterbur for migraines and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in people, so we have some knowledge of its effects on these two¬†conditions.
","
Based on two high-quality studies, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society have endorsed the use of a butterbur extract made from underground parts of the plant, like the root or rhizome, to reduce the frequency of¬†migraines.
Some studies of butterbur root or leaf extracts suggest that they may be helpful for symptoms of hay fever (allergic¬†rhinitis).
Butterbur has not been proven to be helpful for allergic skin reactions or¬†asthma.
","
The raw, unprocessed butterbur plant contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs can cause liver damage and can result in serious illness. Only butterbur products that have been processed to remove PAs and are labeled or certified as PA-free should be¬†used.
Several studies, including a few studies of children and adolescents, have reported that PA-free butterbur products are safe and well tolerated when taken by mouth in recommended doses for up to 16 weeks. The safety of longer-term use has not been¬†established.
Butterbur is usually well tolerated but can cause side effects such as belching, headache, itchy eyes, diarrhea, breathing difficulties, fatigue, and¬†drowsiness.
Butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and¬†daisies.
Butterbur should only be given to children under the supervision of a qualified health¬†practitioner.

8,Cat's Claw,"
Common Names:¬†
  cat‚Äôs claw, u√±a de¬†gato","
Cat‚Äôs claw is a woody vine that grows wild in the Amazon rainforest and other tropical areas of Central and South America. Its thorns resemble a cat‚Äôs¬†claws.
The two most common species are U. tomentosa and U. guianensis. Most commercial preparations of cat‚Äôs claw contain U. tomentosa.
Using cat‚Äôs claw for health dates back to the Inca civilization. Its historical uses have included for contraception, inflammation, cancer, and viral infections, and to stimulate the immune¬†system.
Today, cat‚Äôs claw is used as a dietary supplement for a variety of health conditions including viral infections (such as herpes and HIV), Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, cancer, arthritis, diverticulitis, peptic ulcers, colitis, gastritis, hemorrhoids, parasites, and leaky bowel¬†syndrome.
The bark and root of cat‚Äôs claw are used to make liquid extracts, capsules, tablets, and¬†tea.
","
There have been very few high quality clinical trials (studies done in people) of cat‚Äôs¬†claw.
","
There‚Äôs no conclusive scientific evidence based on studies in people that supports using cat‚Äôs claw for any health¬†purpose.
","
Few side effects have been reported for cat‚Äôs claw when taken in small¬†amounts.
Women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant should avoid using cat‚Äôs claw because of its past use for preventing and aborting¬†pregnancy.

9,Chamomile,"
Common Names:¬†
  chamomile, German¬†chamomile","
There are two types of chamomile: German chamomile and Roman chamomile. This fact sheet focuses on German¬†chamomile.
Chamomile was described in ancient medical writings and was an important medicinal herb in ancient Egypt, Greece, and¬†Rome.
Today, chamomile is used as a dietary supplement for sleeplessness, anxiety, and gastrointestinal conditions such as upset stomach, gas, and diarrhea. It is also used topically for skin conditions and for mouth sores resulting from cancer¬†treatment.
The flowering tops of the chamomile plant are used to make teas, liquid extracts, capsules, or tablets. The herb can also be applied to the skin as a cream or an ointment, or used as a mouth¬†rinse.
","
Not much is known about the health effects of chamomile because it has not been well studied in¬†people.
","
Some preliminary studies suggest that a chamomile dietary supplement might be helpful for generalized anxiety¬†disorder.
Some research has found that products containing certain combinations of herbs that include chamomile may be of benefit for upset stomach, for diarrhea in children, and for infants with colic. But chamomile alone has not been shown to be helpful for these¬†conditions.
","
There have been reports of allergic reactions, including rare cases of anaphylaxis (a life-threatening allergic reaction), in people who have consumed or come into contact with chamomile¬†products.
People are more likely to experience allergic reactions to chamomile if they‚Äôre allergic to related plants such as ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, or¬†daisies.
Interactions between chamomile and cyclosporine (a drug used to prevent rejection of organ transplants) and warfarin (a blood thinner) have been reported, and there are theoretical reasons to suspect that chamomile might interact with other drugs as well. Talk to your health care provider before taking chamomile if you‚Äôre taking any type of¬†medicine.

10,Chasteberry,"
Common Names:¬†
  chasteberry, chastetree, chaste tree berry, Vitex, monk‚Äôs pepper, lilac¬†chastetree","
Chasteberry is the fruit of the chaste tree, which is native to Central Asia and the Mediterranean¬†region.
The plant was believed to promote chastity (hence its name). Monks in the Middle Ages reportedly used it to decrease sexual¬†desire.
Chasteberry was also used for reproductive¬†disorders.
Today, chasteberry is used as a dietary supplement for menstrual problems, menopause symptoms, infertility, and other¬†conditions.
Chasteberry is available as a liquid extract, capsules, tablets, and an essential¬†oil.
","
There‚Äôs not a lot of strong research on the effectiveness of chasteberry for any condition. We do have some clear safety information on the¬†herb.
","
A few preliminary studies found that chasteberry may improve some symptoms of premenstrual syndrome but the evidence isn‚Äôt¬†firm.
Researchers have studied chasteberry for breast pain and infertility, but there isn‚Äôt enough reliable scientific evidence to know if it¬†helps.
There‚Äôs no evidence that chasteberry helps with menopausal¬†symptoms.
","
When used in limited amounts, chasteberry appears to be generally well tolerated. Few side effects have been¬†reported.
Women on birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy, or who have a hormone-sensitive condition (such as breast cancer) should not use¬†chasteberry.
People taking dopamine-related medications, such as certain antipsychotic drugs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease medications should avoid using¬†chasteberry.

11,Cinnamon,"
Common Names:¬†
  cinnamon, cinnamon bark, Ceylon cinnamon, cassia¬†cinnamon","
There are many types of cinnamon. Cassia cinnamon, native to China, is the most common type sold in the United States and Canada. Ceylon cinnamon, native to Sri Lanka, is common in other countries and is known as ‚Äútrue‚Äù¬†cinnamon.
Used as a spice for thousands of years, cinnamon comes from the bark of the cinnamon tree. Essential oils are made from the bark, leaves, or twigs of cassia¬†cinnamon.
Cinnamon has a long history as a traditional medicine, including for¬†bronchitis.
Today, some people use cinnamon as a dietary supplement for gastrointestinal problems, loss of appetite, and diabetes, among other¬†conditions.
Cinnamon is used in capsules, teas, and¬†extracts.
","
We have a fair amount of information on cinnamon from studies done in¬†people.
","
Studies done in people don‚Äôt support using cinnamon for any health¬†condition.
A 2012 systematic review of 10 randomized controlled clinical trials in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes suggests that cinnamon doesn‚Äôt help to reduce levels of glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a long-term measure of glucose (blood sugar)¬†control.
A product containing cinnamon, calcium, and zinc didn‚Äôt improve blood pressure in a small study of people with type 2¬†diabetes.
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-supported research is looking at the effect of cinnamon on processes involved in multiple¬†sclerosis.
","
Cinnamon supplements appear to be safe for most people for short-term use if not taken in large amounts. Some people may have allergic reactions to¬†cinnamon.
Cassia cinnamon contains varying amounts of a chemical called coumarin, which might cause or worsen liver disease. In most cases, cassia cinnamon doesn‚Äôt have enough coumarin to make you sick. However, for some people, such as those with liver disease, taking a large amount of cassia cinnamon might worsen their¬†condition.
Cinnamon should not be used in place of conventional medical care or to delay seeking care if you have health problems. This is particularly true if you have¬†diabetes.

12,Colloidal Silver Products,,"Colloidal silver consists of tiny silver particles in a liquid that is sometimes promoted on the Internet as a dietary supplement. However, evidence supporting health-related claims is lacking. In fact, colloidal silver can be dangerous to your health. ",Scientific evidence doesn‚Äôt support the use of colloidal silver dietary supplements for any disease or¬†condition.,"
Colloidal silver and other complementary products or practices that have not been proven safe and effective should never be used to replace conventional medical care or as a reason to postpone seeing a health care provider about a medical¬†problem.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe¬†care.
","Colloidal silver can cause serious side effects. The most common is argyria, a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, which is usually permanent.
Colloidal silver can also cause poor absorption of some drugs, such as certain antibiotics and thyroxine (used to treat thyroid deficiency).
The FDA also warned in 1999 that colloidal silver isn’t safe or effective for treating any disease or condition.
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have taken action against a number of companies for making misleading claims about colloidal silver products.","[[{'S': [Colloidal_silver], 'V': [cause], 'O':

13,Cranberry,"
Common Names:¬†
  cranberry, American cranberry,¬†bearberry","
Cranberry is a native evergreen shrub that grows throughout North¬†America.
Historically, cranberry fruits or leaves were used for bladder, stomach, and liver disorders, as well as diabetes, wounds, and other¬†conditions.
Today, cranberry is used as a dietary supplement primarily for urinary tract infections¬†(UTIs).
The berries are used in beverages and food. They are also made into dietary supplements in the form of extracts, powder, capsules, and¬†tablets.
","
There have been a lot of studies in people of cranberry for UTIs, but there‚Äôs very little high quality recent research on cranberry for other¬†conditions.
","
There‚Äôs mixed evidence that cranberry can help to prevent UTIs.

In a 2016 year-long study of 147 women living in nursing homes, taking two daily cranberry capsules decreased bacteria levels in their urine in the first 6 months of the study, but didn‚Äôt decrease their frequency of UTIs over the year of the study, compared to taking a placebo. The two capsules together contained as much proanthocyanidin, a compound that is believed to protect against bacteria, as 20 ounces of cranberry¬†juice.
A 2012 research review of 13 clinical trials suggested that cranberry may help reduce the risk of UTIs in certain groups, including women with recurrent UTIs, children, and people who use cranberry-containing products more than twice¬†daily.
A 2012 research review of 24 clinical trials concluded that cranberry juice and supplements don‚Äôt prevent UTIs but many of the studies were poor¬†quality.


Cranberry hasn‚Äôt been shown to be effective as a treatment for an existing¬†UTI.
NCCIH-supported research is looking at the possible effects of cranberry on cancer-related anemia and tumor¬†cells.
","
Drinking cranberry juice appears to be safe, although large amounts can cause stomach upset and may over time increase the risk of kidney¬†stones.
Large doses of cranberry may alter levels of warfarin, an anticoagulant¬†(blood-thinner).
People who think they have a UTI should see a health care provider for a diagnosis and treatment. Don‚Äôt use cranberry products in place of proven treatments for¬†infections.

Common Names:¬†
  dandelion, lion‚Äôs tooth,¬†blowball","
Dandelion greens are edible and are a rich source of vitamin A. Dandelion has been used in traditional medical systems, including Native American, traditional Chinese, and traditional Arabic¬†medicine.
Dandelion has a long history of use for problems of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Today, dandelion as a dietary supplement is used as a blood ‚Äútonic,‚Äù as a diuretic, for minor digestive problems, and for other¬†purposes.
The leaves and roots of the dandelion, or the whole plant, are used fresh or dried in capsules or extracts. As a food, dandelion is used as a salad green and in soups, wine, and¬†teas.
","
We know very little about dandelion‚Äôs health effects. There‚Äôs little scientific evidence on this¬†herb.
","
There‚Äôs no compelling scientific evidence supporting the use of dandelion for any health¬†condition.
","
The use of dandelion as a food is generally considered safe. However, some people are allergic to dandelion; allergic reactions are especially likely in people who are allergic to related plants such as ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, and daisies. The safety of using dandelion supplements for health-related purposes is¬†uncertain.

15,Echinacea,"
Common Names:¬†
  echinacea, purple coneflower, coneflower, American¬†coneflower","
There are nine known species of echinacea, all of which are native to North America. They were used by Native Americans of the Great Plains region as traditional¬†medicines.
Echinacea is used as a dietary supplement for the common cold and other infections, based on the idea that it might stimulate the immune system to more effectively fight infection. Echinacea preparations have been used topically (applied to the skin) for wounds and skin¬†problems.
The roots and above-ground parts of the echinacea plant are used fresh or dried to make teas, squeezed (expressed) juice, extracts, capsules and tablets, and preparations for external use. Several species of echinacea, most commonly Echinacea purpurea or Echinacea angustifolia, may be included in dietary¬†supplements.
","
Many studies have been done on echinacea and the common cold. Much less research has been done on the use of echinacea for other health¬†purposes.
","
Taking echinacea after you catch a cold has not been shown to shorten the time that you‚Äôll be¬†sick.
Taking echinacea while you‚Äôre well may slightly reduce your chances of catching a cold. However, the evidence on this point isn‚Äôt completely certain. Currently, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research to identify the active constituents in echinacea and to study the effects on the human immune system of substances in bacteria that live within echinacea¬†plants.
","
There are many different echinacea products. They may contain different species of plants or different parts of the plant, be manufactured in different ways, and have other ingredients in addition to echinacea. Most of these products have not been tested in¬†people.
For most people, short-term oral (by mouth) use of echinacea is probably safe; the safety of long-term use is¬†uncertain.
The most common side effects of echinacea are digestive tract symptoms, such as nausea or stomach¬†pain.
Some people have allergic reactions to echinacea, which may be severe. Some children participating in a clinical trial of echinacea developed rashes, which may have been caused by an allergic reaction. People with atopy (a genetic tendency toward allergic reactions) may be more likely to have an allergic reaction when taking¬†echinacea.
Current evidence indicates that the risk of interactions between echinacea supplements and most medications is¬†low.

16,Ephedra,"
Common Names:¬†
  ephedra, Chinese ephedra, ma¬†huang","
Ephedra is an evergreen shrub-like plant native to central Asia, and Mongolia; it also grows in the southwestern United¬†States.
People have used ephedra for centuries in China for colds, fever, flu, headaches, asthma, nasal congestion, and¬†wheezing.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (compounds found in some ephedra species) in the United States in 2004. It was an ingredient in some dietary supplements marketed for weight loss, increased energy, and enhanced athletic¬†performance.
The dried stems and leaves of the ephedra plant have been used to create capsules, tablets, extracts, and¬†teas.
","
A large amount of research led to ephedrine alkaloids becoming main oral asthma medications in the 1940s and 1950s. Ephedra also has been used as a weight-loss agent and energy enhancer for athletic performance. However, the increasing number of reported adverse events caused the FDA to ban dietary supplements that contain ephedrine¬†alkaloids.
","
According to the FDA, there is little evidence of ephedra‚Äôs effectiveness, except for short-term weight loss. However, the increased risk of heart problems and stroke outweighs any¬†benefits.
","
The FDA banned the U.S. sale of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids. It found that these supplements had an unreasonable risk of injury or illness‚Äîparticularly cardiovascular complications‚Äîand a risk of death. The ban does not apply to traditional Chinese herbal¬†remedies.
Using ephedra may worsen many health conditions such as heart disease and kidney disease. Ephedra has been associated with stroke. It also may contribute to increased blood sugar¬†levels.
Ephedra may intensify or cause seizures in people with seizure¬†disorders.
Taking ephedra may also cause anxiety, dizziness, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, headache, irritation of the stomach, nausea, psychosis, restlessness, sleep problems, and tremors. Some of these side effects may be associated with long-term use of¬†ephedra.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and children should avoid taking¬†ephedra.
Ephedra use may lead to serious health problems when used with other dietary supplements or¬†medicines.
Combining ephedra with caffeine increases the risk of potentially serious side¬†effects.

17,European Elder (Elderberry),"
Common Names:¬†
  European elder, black elder, elderberry, elder flower,¬†sambucus","
European elder is a tree native to Europe and parts of Asia and Africa, and it also grows in the United States. The name ‚Äúelder‚Äù comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ‚Äúaeld,‚Äù meaning fire. The terms ‚Äúelder flower‚Äù and ‚Äúelderberry‚Äù may refer to either European elder or a different herb called American elder. This fact sheet focuses only on European¬†elder.
Various parts of the elder tree, including the bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and roots, have long been used in traditional¬†medicine.
Currently, elderberry and elder flower are used as dietary supplements for flu, colds, constipation, and other¬†conditions.
The dried flowers (elder flower) and the dried ripe or fresh berries (elderberry) of the European elder tree are used in teas, extracts, and¬†capsules.
","
A small number of studies in people have evaluated European elder for various health conditions. Some of these studies used products that included several ingredients, so the actions of individual ingredients are¬†unclear.
","
Although some preliminary research indicates that elderberry may relieve flu symptoms, the evidence is not strong enough to support its use for this¬†purpose.
A few studies have suggested that combination products containing elder flower and other herbs might be helpful for sinusitis, but because the products contain multiple ingredients, it‚Äôs unclear what role, if any, elder flower plays in their¬†effects.
There‚Äôs not enough information to show whether elder flower and elderberry are helpful for any other¬†purposes.
Researchers funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are studying the antioxidant effects of extracts from elderberry and their possible relevance to the body‚Äôs defense against¬†infection.
","
The leaves, stems, raw and unripe berries, and other plant parts of the elder tree contain a toxic substance and, if not properly prepared, may cause nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea. Because the substance may also be present in the flower, consuming large amounts of the flower might be harmful; however, no illnesses caused by elder flower have been¬†reported.

18,European Mistletoe,"
Common Names:¬†
  European mistletoe,¬†mistletoe","
European mistletoe grows on several types of common trees such as apple, oak, pine, and elm trees. Where the term ‚Äúmistletoe‚Äù is used in this fact sheet, it refers to European mistletoe. European mistletoe is different from American mistletoe, the type of mistletoe that grows in the United States and is used as a holiday¬†decoration.
Mistletoe has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for a variety of conditions including seizures, headaches, and arthritis. Today, mistletoe is used in Europe as a treatment for¬†cancer.
The berries, leaves, and stems of mistletoe are used to make extracts, which are usually given by injection under the skin. Mistletoe may also be taken orally (by mouth) as a dietary supplement. In Europe, mistletoe extracts that are given by injection are sold as prescription drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. In the United States, the use of injectable mistletoe extracts is permitted only in clinical¬†trials.
","
Although mistletoe has been studied for cancer, its effects are not well understood because much of the research on it has been of poor¬†quality.
","
There have been clinical trials of mistletoe for cancer, mostly in Europe. Although some trials indicated that mistletoe improved survival or quality of life, almost all of the trials had major weaknesses that raise doubts about their findings. These weaknesses have included small numbers of patients, incomplete data, lack of information about the dose of mistletoe, and problems with the design of the¬†studies.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Cancer Institute have completed a preliminary trial to evaluate the safety of injected European mistletoe extract in combination with a cancer drug in patients with advanced cancer. It showed that patients could tolerate the herb/drug combination and provided other information that may be helpful in the design of future studies to evaluate mistletoe‚Äôs¬†effectiveness.
Mistletoe is not a proven cancer treatment. It should not be used outside of clinical¬†trials.
","
Mistletoe berries and leaves can cause serious harmful effects when taken¬†orally.
Injected mistletoe extract may cause soreness and inflammation at the injection site, headache, fever, and chills. Serious side effects are rare, but a few severe allergic reactions have been¬†reported.

19,Evening Primrose Oil,"
Common Names:¬†
  evening primrose oil,¬†EPO","
Evening primrose is a plant native to North America, but it grows in Europe and parts of the Southern hemisphere as well. It has yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. Evening primrose oil contains the fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid¬†(GLA).
Native Americans used the whole plant for bruises and its roots for hemorrhoids. The leaves were traditionally used for minor wounds, gastrointestinal complaints, and sore¬†throats.
Today, people use evening primrose oil dietary supplements for eczema (a condition involving red, swollen, itchy skin, sometimes caused by allergies), rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), breast pain, menopause symptoms, and other¬†conditions.
Evening primrose oil is obtained from the seeds of the evening primrose and is usually sold in capsule¬†form.
","
Many studies in people have evaluated evening primrose oil for eczema, PMS, or breast pain. Smaller numbers of studies have evaluated it for other health¬†conditions.
","
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to support the use of evening primrose oil for any health¬†condition.
According to a comprehensive 2013 evaluation of the evidence, evening primrose oil, taken orally (by mouth), is not helpful for relieving symptoms of¬†eczema.
Most studies of evening primrose oil for PMS have not found it to be¬†helpful.
Studies of evening primrose oil for breast pain have had conflicting¬†results.
A small amount of evidence suggests that evening primrose oil might be helpful for diabetic neuropathy (nerve problems caused by¬†diabetes).
","
Evening primrose oil is probably safe for most people when taken for short periods of time. There can be mild side effects, such as stomach upset and¬†headache.
The safety of long-term use of evening primrose oil has not been¬†established.
Evening primrose oil may increase the risk of some complications of pregnancy. Talk with your health care provider if you‚Äôre considering using evening primrose oil during¬†pregnancy.
Evening primrose oil may increase bleeding in people who are taking the anticoagulant (blood thinning) medication warfarin¬†(Coumadin).

20,Fenugreek,"
Common Name:¬†
  fenugreek","
Fenugreek is in the spice blend garam masala. It‚Äôs used to flavor imitation maple syrup and as a condiment. Its extracts are also in soaps and¬†cosmetics.
Historically, fenugreek was used for a variety of health conditions, including digestive problems and to induce¬†childbirth.
Today, fenugreek is used as a dietary supplement for diabetes, to stimulate milk production during breastfeeding, and for other health conditions. It‚Äôs also used topically as a dressing for wounds or¬†eczema.
The seeds are made into capsules, powders, teas, liquid extracts, and a dressing for the¬†skin.
","
We have little conclusive evidence about the effects of fenugreek on health conditions, though we do have a fair amount of information on its possible side¬†effects.
","
A few small studies found that fenugreek may help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes (generally type 2), but the evidence is¬†weak.
Some studies suggest‚Äîbut haven‚Äôt proven‚Äîthat fenugreek may increase milk production in women who are¬†breastfeeding.
There isn‚Äôt enough scientific evidence to support the use of fenugreek for any health¬†condition.
","
Do not take fenugreek while pregnant because it may affect uterine¬†contractions.
Fenugreek may act like estrogen in the body and be unsafe for women with hormone-sensitive¬†cancers.
Side effects of fenugreek may include diarrhea; a maple-like smell to urine, breast milk, and perspiration; and a worsening of¬†asthma.
There‚Äôs little information on the risks of taking fenugreek while¬†breastfeeding.
Fenugreek should not be used in place of conventional medical care or to delay seeking care if you have health problems. This is particularly true if you have¬†diabetes.

21,Feverfew,"
Common Names:¬†
  feverfew, bachelor‚Äôs buttons,¬†featherfew","
Feverfew grows naturally throughout Europe and North and South¬†America.
Historically, people have used feverfew for fevers, headaches, constipation, diarrhea, difficulty in labor, and¬†dizziness.
Today, people use feverfew as a dietary supplement for migraine headache prevention, problems with menstruation, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, allergies, asthma, tinnitus (ringing or roaring sounds in the ears), dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and for intestinal parasites. Topically, people use it as a skin cleanser to reduce or prevent skin infections and for¬†toothaches.
The dried leaves‚Äîand sometimes flowers and stems‚Äîof feverfew are made into capsules, tablets, and liquid extracts, and¬†teas.
","
Only a few studies have looked into feverfew‚Äôs use for migraine headache. There‚Äôs little or no evidence about feverfew for any other health¬†conditions.
","
Some research suggests that feverfew may help to prevent migraine headaches, but results have been mixed. However, evidence-based guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society suggest that a feverfew extract may be effective and should be considered for migraine¬†prevention.
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to know if feverfew helps other¬†conditions.
","
No serious side effects have been reported from feverfew. Side effects can include nausea, digestive problems, and bloating; if the fresh leaves are chewed, sores and irritation of the mouth may¬†occur.
People who take feverfew for a long time and then stop taking it may have difficulty sleeping, headaches, anxiety, and stiff and painful¬†muscles.
Do not take feverfew while pregnant because it may affect uterine¬†contractions.
Handling the plant may cause skin¬†irritation.

22,Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil,"
Common Names:¬†
  flaxseed, flax,¬†linseed","
Over the thousands of years it‚Äôs been cultivated, flaxseed has had a variety of health and industrial uses. Around 500 B.C., Hippocrates wrote about flaxseed being a laxative, and pioneers in North America made flaxseed dressings for cuts and burns. Fiber from the plant is made into linen, and oil from the seed is used in paints, among other¬†products.
Today, flaxseed and flaxseed oil are used as dietary supplements for constipation, diabetes, cholesterol, cancer, and other¬†conditions.
Flaxseed is made into tablets, extracts, powder, and flour. The oil is also put in¬†capsules.
","
There have been a number of studies in people of flaxseed and flaxseed oil, including their effect on hot¬†flashes.
","
Flaxseed contains fiber, which generally helps with constipation. However, there‚Äôs little research on the effectiveness of flaxseed for¬†constipation.
Studies of flaxseed and flaxseed oil to lower cholesterol levels have had mixed results. A 2009 research review found that flaxseed lowered cholesterol only in people with relatively high initial cholesterol¬†levels.
Flaxseed doesn‚Äôt decrease hot flashes, studies from 2010 and 2012¬†suggest.
NCCIH is funding preliminary research on the potential role of substances in flaxseed for ovarian cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, asthma, and¬†inflammation.
","
Don‚Äôt eat raw or unripe flaxseeds, which may contain potentially toxic¬†compounds.
Flaxseed and flaxseed oil supplements seem to be well tolerated in limited amounts. Few side effects have been¬†reported.
Avoid flaxseed and flaxseed oil during pregnancy as they may have mild hormonal effects. There‚Äôs little reliable information on whether it‚Äôs safe to use flaxseed when¬†nursing.
Flaxseed, like any fiber supplement, should be taken with plenty of water, as it could worsen constipation or, in rare cases, cause an intestinal blockage. Both flaxseed and flaxseed oil can cause¬†diarrhea.

23,Garlic,"
Common Name:¬†
  garlic","
Garlic is the edible bulb from a plant in the lily family. It was traditionally used for health purposes by people in many parts of the world, including the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Japanese, and Native¬†Americans.
Currently, garlic is used as a dietary supplement for many purposes, including high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and the common cold, as well as in attempts to prevent cancer and other¬†diseases.
Fresh garlic, garlic powder, and garlic oil are used to flavor foods. Garlic dietary supplements are sold as tablets or capsules. Garlic oil may be used topically (applied to the¬†skin).
","
A great deal of research has been done on garlic, but much of it consists of small, preliminary, or low-quality¬†studies.
","
There‚Äôs conflicting evidence about whether garlic lowers blood cholesterol levels. If it does, the effect is small, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (the so-called ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol that‚Äôs linked to increased heart disease risk) may not be reduced at¬†all.
Garlic may be helpful for high blood pressure, but the evidence is¬†weak.
Some studies indicate that certain groups of people who eat more garlic may be less likely to develop certain cancers, such as stomach and colon cancers. However, garlic in dietary supplement form has not been shown to help reduce the risk of these cancers. The National Cancer Institute recognizes garlic as one of several vegetables with potential anticancer properties but does not recommend using garlic dietary supplements for cancer¬†prevention.
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to show whether garlic is helpful for the common¬†cold.
","
Garlic is probably safe for most people in the amounts usually eaten in¬†foods.
Side effects include breath and body odor, heartburn, and upset stomach. These side effects can be more noticeable with raw garlic. Some people have allergic reactions to¬†garlic.
Taking garlic may increase the risk of bleeding. If you take an anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as warfarin (Coumadin) or if you need surgery, tell your health care provider if you‚Äôre taking or planning to take garlic dietary¬†supplements.
Garlic has been found to interfere with the effectiveness of some drugs, including saquinavir, a drug used to treat HIV¬†infection.

24,Ginger,"
Common Name:¬†
  ginger","
Ginger is a tropical plant that has green-purple flowers and a fragrant underground stem (called a rhizome). It is widely used as a flavoring or fragrance in foods, beverages, soaps, and¬†cosmetics.
Ancient Sanskrit, Chinese, Greek, Roman, and Arabic texts discussed the use of ginger for health-related purposes. In Asian medicine, dried ginger has been used for thousands of years to treat stomach ache, diarrhea, and¬†nausea.
Today, ginger is used as a dietary supplement for postsurgery nausea; nausea caused by motion, chemotherapy, or pregnancy; rheumatoid arthritis; and¬†osteoarthritis.
Common forms of ginger include the fresh or dried root, tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, and¬†teas.
","
There‚Äôs some information from studies in people on the use of ginger for nausea and¬†vomiting.
Much less is known about other uses of ginger for other health¬†conditions.
","
Some evidence indicates that ginger may help relieve pregnancy-related nausea and¬†vomiting.
Ginger may help to control nausea related to cancer chemotherapy when used in addition to conventional anti-nausea¬†medication.
It‚Äôs unclear whether ginger is helpful for postsurgery nausea, motion sickness, rheumatoid arthritis, or¬†osteoarthritis.
","
Ginger, when used as a spice, is believed to be generally¬†safe.
In some people, ginger can have mild side effects such as abdominal discomfort, heartburn, diarrhea, and¬†gas.
Some experts recommend that people with gallstone disease use caution with ginger because it may increase the flow of¬†bile.
Research has not definitely shown whether ginger interacts with medications, but concerns have been raised that it might interact with anticoagulants (blood¬†thinners).
Although several studies have found no evidence of harm from taking ginger during pregnancy, it‚Äôs uncertain whether ginger is always safe for pregnant women. If you‚Äôre considering using ginger while you‚Äôre pregnant, consult your health care¬†provider.

Common Names:¬†
  ginkgo, Ginkgo biloba, fossil tree, maidenhair tree, Japanese silver apricot, baiguo,¬†yinhsing","
Ginkgo, one of the oldest living tree species in the world, has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine. Members of the royal court were given ginkgo nuts for senility. Other historical uses for ginkgo were for asthma, bronchitis, and kidney and bladder¬†disorders.
Today, the extract from ginkgo leaves is used as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including dementia, eye problems, intermittent claudication (leg pain caused by narrowing arteries), tinnitus, and other health¬†problems.
Ginkgo is made into tablets, capsules, extracts, tea, and¬†cosmetics.
","
There have been a lot of studies on the possible health effects and risks of people using¬†ginkgo.
","
There‚Äôs no conclusive evidence that ginkgo is helpful for any health¬†condition.
Ginkgo doesn‚Äôt help prevent or slow dementia or cognitive decline, according to studies, including the long-term Ginkgo Evaluation Memory Study, which enrolled more than 3,000 older adults and was funded in part by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health¬†(NCCIH).
There‚Äôs no strong evidence that ginkgo helps with memory enhancement in healthy people, blood pressure, intermittent claudication, tinnitus, age-related macular degeneration, the risk of having a heart attack or stroke, or with other¬†conditions.
Ongoing NCCIH-funded research is looking at whether a compound in ginkgo may help with¬†diabetes.
","
For many healthy adults, ginkgo appears to be safe when taken by mouth in moderate¬†amounts.
Side effects of ginkgo may include headache, stomach upset, and allergic skin reactions. If you‚Äôre older, have a known bleeding risk, or are pregnant you should be cautious about ginkgo possibly increasing your risk of¬†bleeding.
In a 2013 research study, rodents given ginkgo had an increased risk of developing liver and thyroid cancer at the end of the 2-year¬†tests.
Ginkgo may interact with some conventional medications, including anticoagulants (blood thinners), research reviews¬†show.
Eating fresh (raw) or roasted ginkgo seeds can be poisonous and have serious side¬†effects.

26,Goldenseal,"
Common Names:¬†
  goldenseal, yellow¬†root","
Goldenseal is a plant native to North America. Overharvesting and loss of habitat have decreased the availability of wild goldenseal, but the plant is now grown commercially in the United States, especially in the Blue Ridge¬†Mountains.
Historically, Native Americans used goldenseal for skin disorders, ulcers, fevers, and other conditions. European settlers adopted it as a medicinal plant, using it for a variety of¬†conditions.
Currently, goldenseal is used as a dietary supplement for colds and other respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), ulcers, and digestive upsets such as diarrhea and constipation. It is also used as a mouthwash for sore gums and as an eyewash for eye inflammation, and it is applied to the skin for rashes and other skin¬†problems.
The roots of goldenseal are dried and used to make teas, extracts, tablets, or capsules. Goldenseal is often combined with echinacea in commercial¬†products.
","
Very little research has been done on the health effects of¬†goldenseal.
","
The scientific evidence does not support the use of goldenseal for any health-related¬†purpose.
Berberine, a substance found in goldenseal, has been studied for heart failure, diarrhea, infections, and other health conditions. However, when people take goldenseal orally (by mouth), very little berberine may be absorbed by the body or enter the bloodstream, so study results on berberine may not apply to¬†goldenseal.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research to study how goldenseal may act against bacteria and to develop research-grade goldenseal for use in human¬†studies.
","
There isn‚Äôt much reliable information on the safety of¬†goldenseal.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use goldenseal, and it should not be given to infants. Berberine can cause or worsen jaundice in newborn infants and could lead to a life-threatening problem called¬†kernicterus.
Goldenseal contains substances that may change the way your body processes many medications. If you‚Äôre taking medication, consult your health care provider before using¬†goldenseal.

27,Grape Seed Extract,"
Common Names:¬†
  grape seed extract, grape¬†seed","
Since ancient Greece people have used grapes, grape leaves, and sap for health purposes. Grape seed extract was developed in the¬†1970s.
Today, grape seed extract is used as a dietary supplement for various conditions, including for venous insufficiency (when veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart), to promote wound healing, and to reduce¬†inflammation.
Grape seed extract contains the antioxidant compound oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC), which has been studied for a variety of health¬†conditions.
OPCs are found in extracts of grape skin and seeds, which are by-products of the wine industry. Grape seed extract is available in capsules and tablets and as a¬†liquid.
","
There are a few well-controlled studies of people using grape seed extract for health¬†conditions.
","
Some studies suggest that compounds in grape seed extract may reduce edema (swelling) and help with symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency, but the evidence isn‚Äôt¬†strong.
Grape seed extract may have some heart benefits, including lowering systolic blood pressure and heart rate. The lower heart rate may cause the decrease in systolic blood pressure. The extract had no effect on lipid levels such as cholesterol or C-reactive protein, an indication of inflammation in your¬†arteries.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is supporting preliminary research on grape seed extract for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and also for hereditary hemochromatosis, when the body‚Äôs iron levels are too high. The National Cancer Institute is supporting preliminary studies on grape seed extract for preventing prostate, lung, and colon¬†cancer.
","
Grape seed extract is generally well tolerated when taken in moderate amounts. It has been tested safely for up to 14 weeks in studies of people. It‚Äôs possibly unsafe if you have a bleeding disorder or are going to have surgery or if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners), such as warfarin or¬†aspirin.

28,Green Tea,"
Common Name:¬†
  green¬†tea","
Green, black, and oolong teas all come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, but are prepared using different methods. To produce green tea, fresh leaves from the plant are lightly¬†steamed.
Tea has been used for medicinal purposes in China and Japan for thousands of¬†years.
Current uses of green tea as a beverage or dietary supplement include improving mental alertness, relieving digestive symptoms and headaches, and promoting weight loss. Green tea and its extracts, such as one of its components, EGCG, have been studied for their possible protective effects against heart disease and¬†cancer.
Green tea is consumed as a beverage. It is also sold in liquid extracts, capsules, and tablets and is sometimes used in topical products (intended to be applied to the¬†skin).
","
Although many studies have been done on green tea and its extracts, definite conclusions cannot yet be reached on whether green tea is helpful for most of the purposes for which it is¬†used.
","
There‚Äôs evidence that green tea enhances mental alertness, as would be expected because of its caffeine¬†content.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a specific green tea extract ointment as a prescription drug for treating genital¬†warts.
Studies of green tea and cancer in people have had inconsistent results. The National Cancer Institute does not recommend for or against using green tea to reduce the risk of any type of¬†cancer.
Very few long-term studies have investigated the effects of tea on heart disease risk. However, the limited evidence currently available suggests that both green and black tea might have beneficial effects on some heart disease risk factors, including blood pressure and¬†cholesterol.
Green tea extracts haven‚Äôt been shown to produce a meaningful weight loss in overweight or obese adults. They also haven‚Äôt been shown to help people maintain a weight¬†loss.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is funding research on green tea and its extracts, including studies of the effects of high doses of tea components on the liver, whether substances in green tea can be helpful for iron overload disease, and the safety of a component of green tea in people who are¬†HIV-positive.
","
Green tea, when consumed as a beverage, is believed to be safe when used in moderate¬†amounts.
Liver problems have been reported in a small number of people who took concentrated green tea extracts. Although the evidence that the green tea products caused the liver problems is not conclusive, experts suggest that concentrated green tea extracts be taken with food and that people discontinue use and consult a health care provider if they have a liver disorder or develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or¬†jaundice.
Except for decaffeinated green tea products, green tea and green tea extracts contain substantial amounts of caffeine. Too much caffeine can make people feel jittery and shaky; interfere with sleep; and cause¬†headaches.
Green tea has been shown to reduce blood levels (and therefore the effectiveness) of the drug nadolol, a beta-blocker used for high blood pressure and heart problems. It may also interact with other¬†medicines.

29,Hawthorn,"
Common Names:¬†
  hawthorn, English hawthorn, oneseed hawthorn, harthorne, haw,¬†hawthorne","
Hawthorn is a flowering shrub or tree of the rose family. It is native to Europe and grows in temperate regions throughout the¬†world.
Historically, hawthorn has been used for heart disease as well as for digestive and kidney problems. It has also been used for¬†anxiety.
Extracts from the hawthorn leaf, flower, or berry may be sold as capsules, tablets, or¬†liquids.
","
Hawthorn has been studied for heart failure in people. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can‚Äôt pump as much blood as it¬†should.
Not much is known about hawthorn for any other health conditions as there is little or no¬†evidence.
","
Although some older, short-term studies suggested that hawthorn may have benefits in patients with heart failure, two longer term studies completed in 2008 and 2009‚Äîincluding a 2-year trial involving almost 2,700 people in 13 European countries‚Äîdid not confirm these benefits. In these studies, unlike some of the older ones, patients were given hawthorn in addition to the recommended conventional treatments for heart¬†failure.
","
In most studies of hawthorn for heart failure, no serious safety problems have been reported. However, in one study, patients taking hawthorn were more likely than those taking a placebo (an inactive substance) to have their heart failure get worse soon after the study started. The reason for this is not clear, but one possibility is that hawthorn might have interacted with drugs the patients were¬†taking.
Side effects of hawthorn can include dizziness, nausea, and digestive¬†symptoms.
Hawthorn may interact in harmful ways with drugs, including some heart medications. If you‚Äôre taking medication and you‚Äôre considering using hawthorn, consult your health care¬†provider.

30,Hoodia,"
Common Names:¬†
  hoodia, Kalahari cactus,¬†Xhoba","
Hoodia is a flowering, cactus-like plant that grows in the Kalahari Desert in Africa. Historically, the San Bushmen used hoodia to suppress¬†appetite.
Today, hoodia dietary supplements are used as an appetite suppressant for weight¬†loss.
Hoodia is available as liquids, powders, tablets, and capsules. Some hoodia products also contain other herbs or minerals, such as green tea or¬†chromium.
","
We know very little about hoodia because only one study of this herb has been done in¬†people.
","
In the one small study of hoodia in people, overweight women who took hoodia for 15 days didn‚Äôt lose more weight than those who took a¬†placebo.
","
Little is known about the safety of hoodia. However, the one completed study in people raises concerns. In that study, participants taking hoodia had more side effects than those taking placebos, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and odd skin sensations; they also had increases in blood pressure and undesirable changes in some blood¬†tests.
Whether hoodia interacts with medicines or other supplements is not¬†known.

31,Horse Chestnut,"
Common Names:¬†
  horse chestnut, buckeye, Spanish¬†chestnut","
Horse chestnut trees are native to the Balkan Peninsula (which includes such countries as Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia), but are grown¬†worldwide.
Historically, horse chestnut seed extract was used for joint pain, bladder and gastrointestinal problems, fever, and leg¬†cramps.
Today, people use horse chestnut extract as a dietary supplement for chronic venous insufficiency (when the veins of the lower leg are unable to send blood back toward the heart), hemorrhoids, and swelling after surgery. Preparations made from the tree‚Äôs bark are applied to skin¬†sores.
Usable parts of the plant include the seed, bark, and leaf, but seed extracts are most¬†common.
","
There have been some studies in people on horse chestnut for chronic venous insufficiency but very little research has been done for other¬†conditions.
","
A 2012 systematic review of 17 studies published between 1976 and 2002 suggested that horse chestnut seed extract can improve leg pain, swelling, and itching in people with chronic venous insufficiency when taken for a short time. Results from one of these studies suggested that horse chestnut seed extract may be as effective as wearing compression¬†stockings.
Preliminary evidence from one Chinese study suggested that escin, the main ingredient in horse chestnut, may help restore fertility in some men. However, since all the men in the study also received other supplements and drugs, it‚Äôs unclear whether the improvement was due to this compound alone or the combination¬†approach.
","
The unprocessed seeds, leaves, bark, and flowers of horse chestnut contain esculin, which is poisonous and may increase the risk of bleeding. (Escin, on the other hand, is a different compound and is considered to be¬†safe.)
Properly processing horse chestnut seed extract removes esculin. The processed extract is considered generally safe when used for short periods of time. However, the extract can cause some side effects, including itching, nausea, gastrointestinal upset, muscle spasm, or¬†headache.

Common Names:¬†
  kava, kava kava, ava pepper, ava root,¬†kawa","
Kava is native to the islands of the South Pacific and is a member of the pepper¬†family.
Pacific islanders have used kava in ceremonies to bring about a state of¬†relaxation.
Today, people use kava as a dietary supplement for¬†anxiety.
The root and underground stem (fresh or dried) are used to prepare drinks; they are also made into extracts, capsules, and¬†tablets.
","
There is a fair amount of clinical research on¬†kava.
","
Kava supplements may have a small effect on reducing anxiety, but they have been linked to a risk of severe liver¬†disease.
Differences in dosages used, preparation methods, and study designs have resulted in mixed conclusions about kava‚Äôs¬†usefulness.
","
In March 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned health care providers and the public about the risk of liver damage associated with¬†kava.
Combining kava with alcohol may increase the risk of liver¬†damage.
Long-term use of high doses of kava has been associated with dry, scaly skin or yellowing of the¬†skin.
Heavy consumption of kava has been associated with heart problems and eye¬†irritation.

33,Lavender,"
Common Names:¬†
  lavender, English lavender, common lavender, French¬†lavender","
Lavender is native to the Mediterranean region, the Arabian Peninsula, and Russia. It is grown in Europe, the United States, and¬†Australia.
Lavender has a long history of use to boost appetite and mood, as well as relieve gastrointestinal problems and anxiety. It was also used in ancient Egypt as part of the process for mummifying¬†bodies.
Today, people use lavender as a dietary supplement for anxiety, depression, intestinal problems, and pain. People also apply it to the skin for hair loss, pain, and for improving emotional health. People may also inhale a lavender vapor to help sleep, to reduce pain, and for agitation related to¬†dementia.
Tea can be made from lavender leaves. A vapor for inhalation can be made by mixing lavender oil (an essential oil) with boiling water. Lavender oil is used for massage and in baths. Lavender is also found in capsules and liquid¬†extracts.
","
Many studies have investigated lavender‚Äôs effectiveness for a number of conditions, such as pain, anxiety, stress, and overall well-being, but several were small and of poor¬†quality.
","
There is little scientific evidence of lavender‚Äôs effectiveness for most health¬†uses.
Studies on lavender for anxiety have shown mixed¬†results.
Results of a 1998 study suggested that massaging the scalp with a combination of lavender oil and oils from other herbs may help with hair loss from a condition called alopecia¬†areata.
","
Topical use of diluted lavender oil is generally considered safe for most adults, but reports suggest it can cause skin¬†irritation.
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to determine its safety when inhaled as aromatherapy.
Some evidence suggests that some topical applications containing lavender oil may affect sex hormone¬†activity.
Lavender oil may be poisonous if taken by¬†mouth.
Lavender extracts may cause stomach upset, joint pain, or¬†headache.

34,Licorice Root,"
Common Names:¬†
  licorice root, licorice, liquorice, sweet root, gan cao, gan-zao, Chinese¬†licorice","
Most licorice root grows in Greece, Turkey, and Asia. Anise oil is often used instead of licorice root to flavor licorice¬†candy.
Centuries ago, licorice root was used in Greece, China, and Egypt for stomach inflammation and upper respiratory problems. Licorice root also has been used as a¬†sweetener.
Today, people use licorice root as a dietary supplement for digestive problems, menopausal symptoms, cough, and bacterial and viral infections. People also use it as a¬†shampoo.
Licorice is harvested from the plants‚Äô roots and underground stems. Licorice supplements are available as capsules, tablets, and liquid¬†extracts.
","
A number of studies of licorice root in people have been published, but not enough to support the use for any specific health¬†condition.
","
Glycyrrhizin‚Äîa compound found in licorice root‚Äîhas been tested in a few clinical trials in hepatitis C patients, but there‚Äôs currently not enough evidence to determine if it‚Äôs helpful. Laboratory studies done in Japan (where an injectable glycyrrhizin compound is used in people with chronic hepatitis C who do not respond to conventional treatment) suggest that glycyrrhizin may have some effect against hepatitis¬†C.
There‚Äôs some evidence that topical licorice extract may improve skin rash symptoms, such as redness, swelling, and¬†itching.
A Finnish study of mothers and their young children suggested that eating a lot of actual licorice root during pregnancy may harm a child‚Äôs developing brain, leading to reasoning and behavioral issues, such as attention problems, rule-breaking, and¬†aggression.
Studies of licorice root extracts in people for cavities, mouth ulcers, and oral yeast infections have returned mixed¬†results.
","
In large amounts and with long-term use, licorice root can cause high blood pressure and low potassium levels, which could lead to heart and muscle problems. Some side effects are thought to be due to a chemical called glycyrrhizic acid. Licorice that has had this chemical removed (called DGL for deglycyrrhizinated licorice) may not have the same degree of side¬†effects.
Taking licorice root containing glycyrrhizinic acid with medications that reduce potassium levels such as diuretics might be bad for your¬†heart.
Pregnant women should avoid using licorice root as a supplement or consuming large amounts of it as¬†food.

35,Milk Thistle,"
Common Names:¬†
  milk thistle, Mary thistle, holy¬†thistle.","
Milk thistle is native to southern Europe, southern Russia, Asia Minor, and northern Africa. It also grows in North and South America and South¬†Australia.
Silymarin is considered to be the main component of milk thistle seeds, but the terms ‚Äúmilk thistle‚Äù and ‚Äúsilymarin‚Äù often are used¬†interchangeably.
Historically, people have used milk thistle for liver disorders, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and gallbladder¬†problems.
Silymarin is the most commonly used herbal supplement in the United States for liver¬†problems.
Milk thistle products are available as capsules, powders, and¬†extracts.
","
We know little about whether milk thistle is effective in people, as only a few well-designed clinical studies have been¬†conducted.
","
Results from clinical trials of milk thistle for liver diseases have been mixed, and two rigorously designed studies found no¬†benefit.
The 2008 Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) study, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), found that hepatitis C patients who used silymarin had fewer and milder symptoms of liver disease and somewhat better quality of life but no change in virus activity or liver¬†inflammation.
A 2012 clinical trial, cofunded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, showed that two higher-than-usual doses of silymarin were no better than placebo for chronic hepatitis C in people who had not responded to standard antiviral¬†treatment.
Results from a 2013 clinical study suggest that milk thistle may enhance standard treatment in young people with a particular form of anemia (Cooley‚Äôs¬†anemia).
","
In clinical trials, milk thistle appears to be well tolerated in recommended doses. Occasionally, people report various gastrointestinal side¬†effects.
Milk thistle may produce allergic reactions, which tend to be more common among people who are allergic to plants in the same family (for example, ragweed, chrysanthemum, marigold, and¬†daisy).
Compounds in milk thistle may lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes should use¬†caution.

36,Noni,"
Common Names:¬†
  noni, morinda, Indian mulberry, hog apple,¬†canarywood","
Noni is a small evergreen tree found from Southeastern Asia to Australia, especially in Polynesia; it often grows among lava¬†flows.
Historically, many parts of the noni plant were used both externally and internally for a variety of health purposes, alone or in combination with other¬†herbs.
Today, the principal part of the noni plant used for health purposes is the ripe fruit, which is used as a dietary supplement for various chronic diseases, including¬†cancer.
The noni fruit is most commonly combined with other fruits to make juice. Preparations of the fruit and leaves are also available in capsules, tablets, and¬†teas.
","
Only a few studies have investigated the effects of noni in¬†people.
","
In laboratory research, noni has shown antioxidant, immune-stimulating, and tumor-fighting properties. These results suggest that noni may warrant further study for various diseases. However, noni has not been shown to have beneficial effects on any chronic health condition in studies of¬†people.
","
Few side effects have been reported in studies of noni. However, several cases of liver toxicity have been reported in people who had consumed noni. It is unclear whether noni caused the liver¬†problems.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings to noni manufacturers about making unsupported health¬†claims.
Noni contains a substantial amount of potassium. People who need to restrict their intake of potassium should consult a health care provider before using¬†noni.

37,Omega-3 Supplements: An Introduction,,"How much do we know about omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3s)?Extensive research has been done on omega-3s, especially the types found in seafood (fish and shellfish) and fish oil supplements.",Omega-3s (short for omega-3 fatty acids) are a kind of fat found in foods and in the human body. They are also sold as dietary supplements.¬†,"Research indicates that omega-3 supplements don’t reduce the risk of heart disease. However, people who eat seafood one to four times a week are less likely to die of heart disease. 
High doses of omega-3s can reduce levels of triglycerides. 
Omega-3 supplements may help relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Omega-3 supplements have not been convincingly shown to slow the progression of the eye disease age-related macular degeneration.
For most other conditions for which omega-3 supplements have been studied, the evidence is inconclusive or doesn’t indicate that omega-3s are beneficial.","Side effects of omega-3 supplements are usually mild. They include unpleasant taste, bad breath, bad-smelling sweat, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, and diarrhea.
Several large studies have linked higher blood levels of long-chain omega-3s with higher risks of prostate cancer. However, other research has shown that men who frequently eat seafood have lower prostate cancer death rates and that dietary intakes of long-chain omega-3s aren’t associated with prostate cancer risk. The reason for these apparently conflicting findings is unclear. 
Omega-3 supplements may interact with drugs that affect blood clotting.
It’s uncertain whether people with seafood allergies can safely take fish oil supplements.","[[], [{'S': [They], 'V': [include], 'O': [unpleasant_taste], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [], 'A': [as], 'C': [],

38,Peppermint Oil,"
Common Names:¬†
  peppermint, peppermint¬†oil","The herb peppermint, a natural cross between two types of mint (water mint and spearmint), grows throughout Europe and North America. Both peppermint leaves and the essential oil from peppermint have been used for health purposes. (Essential oils are very concentrated oils containing substances that give a plant its characteristic odor or flavor.) Peppermint is a common flavoring agent in foods, and peppermint oil is used to create a pleasant fragrance in soaps and cosmetics.
Mint has been used for health purposes for several thousand years. It is mentioned in records from ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt. However, peppermint was not recognized as a distinct kind of mint until the 1700s.
Today, peppermint is used as a dietary supplement for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other digestive problems, the common cold, headaches, and other conditions. Peppermint oil is also used topically (applied to the skin) for headache, muscle aches, itching, and other problems. Peppermint leaf is available in teas, capsules, and as a liquid extract. Peppermint oil is available as liquid solutions and in capsules, including enteric-coated capsules.","A small amount of research has been conducted on peppermint oil, primarily focusing on IBS.
Very little research has been done on peppermint leaf.","Peppermint oil has been studied most extensively for IBS. Results from several studies indicate that peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules may improve IBS symptoms.
A few studies have indicated that peppermint oil, in combination with caraway oil, may help relieve indigestion, but this evidence is preliminary and the product that was tested is not available in the United States.
Peppermint oil has been used topically for tension headaches and a limited amount of evidence suggests that it might be helpful for this purpose.
There’s not enough evidence to allow any conclusions to be reached about whether peppermint oil is helpful for nausea, the common cold, or other conditions.
There’s not enough evidence to show whether peppermint leaf is helpful for any condition.","Peppermint oil appears to be safe when taken orally (by mouth) in the doses commonly used. Excessive doses of peppermint oil can be toxic.
Possible side effects of peppermint oil include allergic reactions and heartburn. Capsules containing peppermint oil are often enteric-coated to reduce the likelihood of heartburn. If enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are taken at the same time as antacids, the coating can break down too quickly.
Like other essential oils, peppermint oil is highly concentrated. When the undiluted essential oil is used for health purposes, only a few drops are used.
Side effects of applying peppermint oil to the skin can include skin rashes and irritation. Peppermint oil should not be applied to the face or chest of infants or young children because serious side effects may occur if they inhale the menthol in the oil.
No harmful effects of peppermint leaf tea have been reported. However, the long-term safety of consuming large amounts of peppermint leaf is unknown.","[[], [], [{'S': [Possible_side_effects], 'V': [include], 'O': [allergic_reactions], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [],

39,Pomegranate,"
Common Name:¬†
  Pomegranate","
The pomegranate fruit has a leathery rind (or husk) with many little pockets of edible seeds and juice¬†inside.
Since ancient times, the pomegranate has been a symbol of¬†fertility.
Researchers have studied all parts of the pomegranate for their potential health benefits. Those parts include the fruit, seed, seed oil, tannin-rich peel, root, leaf, and¬†flower.
The pomegranate has been used as a dietary supplement for many conditions including wounds, heart conditions, intestinal problems, and as a gargle for a sore¬†throat.
Pomegranate is made into capsules, extracts, teas, powders, and juice¬†products.
","
We don‚Äôt have a lot of strong scientific evidence on the effects of pomegranate for people‚Äôs¬†health.
","
A 2012 clinical trial of about 100 dialysis patients suggested that pomegranate juice may help ward off infections. In the study, the patients who were given pomegranate juice three times a week for a year had fewer hospitalizations for infections and fewer signs of inflammation, compared with patients who got the¬†placebo.
Pomegranate extract in mouthwash may help control dental plaque, according to a small 2011 clinical trial with 30 healthy¬†participants.
Pomegranate may help improve some signs of heart disease but the research isn‚Äôt¬†definitive.
","
Some people, particularly those with plant allergies, may be allergic to¬†pomegranate.
It‚Äôs unclear whether pomegranate interacts with the anticoagulant (blood thinning) medicine warfarin or drugs that work similarly in the body to¬†warfarin.
Federal agencies have taken action against companies selling pomegranate juice and supplements for deceptive advertising and making drug-like claims about the products. For more on this, view the NCCIH Director‚Äôs Page entitled Excessive Claims.

41,Red Clover,"
Common Names:¬†
  red clover, cow clover, meadow clover, wild¬†clover","Like peas and beans, red clover belongs to the family of plants called legumes. Red clover contains substances called isoflavones. Isoflavones are phytoestrogens—compounds similar to the female hormone estrogen.
Historically, red clover was used for a variety of conditions including asthma, whooping cough, cancer, and gout. Today, isoflavone extracts from red clover are most often used as dietary supplements for menopausal symptoms, high cholesterol, or osteoporosis.
The flowering tops of the red clover plant are used to prepare extracts available in tablets or capsules, as well as in teas and liquid forms.","There have been several studies of red clover in people, but their results haven’t provided clear evidence of any beneficial effects.","Red clover has not been clearly shown to be helpful for any health condition.
Most research indicates that taking red clover does not relieve menopause symptoms such as hot flashes.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is supporting research to develop better methods of identifying active components in red clover and to evaluate possible interactions of red clover with medications.","No serious side effects have been reported in studies that evaluated red clover for various health conditions for up to a year.
Because red clover contains estrogen-like compounds, there’s a possibility that long-term use would increase the risk of women developing cancer of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus). However, short-term studies of women who have taken red clover have not shown harmful changes in the uterine lining.

42,Red Yeast Rice: An Introduction,,"
Some red yeast rice products contain substantial amounts of monacolin K, which is chemically identical to the active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. These products may lower blood cholesterol levels and can cause the same types of side effects and drug interactions as¬†lovastatin.
Other red yeast rice products contain little or no monacolin K. It is not known whether these products have any effect on blood cholesterol¬†levels.
Consumers have no way of knowing how much monacolin K is present in most red yeast rice products. The labels on these products usually state only the amount of red yeast rice that they contain, not the amount of monacolin¬†K.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that red yeast rice products that contain more than trace amounts of monacolin K are unapproved new drugs and cannot be sold legally as dietary¬†supplements.
Some red yeast rice products contain a contaminant called citrinin, which can cause kidney¬†failure.
Tell all your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe¬†care.
","Red yeast rice is made by culturing rice with various strains of the yeast Monascus purpureus. Some preparations of red yeast rice are used in food products in Chinese cuisine, including Peking duck. Others have been sold as dietary supplements to lower blood levels of cholesterol and related¬†lipids.","
The same types of side effects that can occur in patients taking lovastatin as a drug can also occur in patients who take red yeast rice products that contain monacolin K. Potential side effects include myopathy (muscle symptoms such as pain and weakness), rhabdomyolysis (a condition in which muscle fibers break down, releasing substances into the bloodstream that can harm the kidneys), and liver toxicity. Each of these three side effects has been reported in people who were taking red yeast¬†rice.
Red yeast rice supplements should not be used while pregnant or¬†breastfeeding.
Lovastatin can interact with a variety of drugs to increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis; these drugs include other cholesterol-lowering agents, certain antibiotics, the antidepressant nefazodone, drugs used to treat fungal infections, and drugs used to treat HIV infection. Red yeast rice containing monacolin K could interact with drugs in the same¬†way.
If the process of culturing red yeast rice is not carefully controlled, a substance called citrinin can form. Citrinin has been shown to cause kidney failure in experimental animals and genetic damage in human cells. In a 2011 analysis of red yeast rice products sold as dietary supplements, 4 of 11 products were found to contain this¬†contaminant.
","Red yeast rice products that contain substantial amounts of monacolin K can lower blood cholesterol levels. Researchers have not reported results of any studies of red yeast rice products that contain little or no monacolin K, so whether these products have any effect on blood cholesterol is¬†unknown.","[[{'S': [Red_yeast_rice_products], 'V': [lower], 'O': [blood_cholesterol_levels], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [], 'C': [], 'type': 'SVO', 'A?': []}, {'S': [that], 'V': [contain], 'O':

43,S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe): An Introduction,,"Research has evaluated several potential uses of SAMe, and a substantial number of studies on depression and liver diseases have been completed. However, some of the studies used injected SAMe, which may not have the same effects as SAMe taken as a dietary¬†supplement.","SAMe was discovered in the early 1950s. It‚Äôs made in the body from methionine, an amino acid found in foods. It has been found to regulate key functions in living¬†cells.","SAMe has been studied primarily for depression, osteoarthritis, and liver diseases. Although there are hints that it might be helpful for these conditions, the evidence is not conclusive.","Information on the long-term safety of SAMe is limited because the participants in most studies took it only for short periods of time. However, in one study of alcohol-related liver disease, participants took SAMe for 2 years; in that study, no serious side effects were reported.
People with bipolar disorder (an illness characterized by mood swings, from depression to mania) should not take SAMe for their depressive symptoms except under the supervision of a health care provider because SAMe may worsen symptoms of mania.
Although SAMe has been used to treat cholestasis during pregnancy, its safety during pregnancy has not been established.
SAMe may decrease the effects of levodopa (L-dopa), a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease. It’s also possible that SAMe might interact with drugs and dietary supplements that increase levels of serotonin (a chemical produced by nerve cells), such as antidepressants, L-tryptophan, and St. John’s wort.
There’s a theoretical concern about the use of SAMe by people who are immunocompromised (such as those who are HIV-positive). Immunocompromised people are at risk for Pneumocystis carinii infection, and SAMe enhances the growth of this microorganism.
Side effects of SAMe are uncommon, and when they do occur they are usually minor problems such as nausea or digestive upsets","[[{'S': [the_participants], 'V': [took], 'O': [it], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP':

44,Sage,"
Common Names:¬†
  sage, common sage, garden sage, true¬†sage","
Sage has a long history of use as a spice and for health purposes. It was used in ancient Egyptian, Roman, and Greek medicine. In Native American rituals, dried sage is burned to promote healing, wisdom, protection, and¬†longevity.
Today, sage is used as a dietary supplement for digestive problems, sore mouth or throat, memory loss, and¬†depression.
Sage leaves or their extracts are available as liquids, throat sprays, tablets, lozenges, and¬†capsules.
","
We don‚Äôt know much about the health effects of sage because little research has been done on¬†it.
","
Sage has not been clearly shown to be helpful for any health¬†condition.
There have been a few studies of sage for sore throat, mood, memory, and blood cholesterol levels. However, the findings are preliminary, and some of the research is of poor¬†quality.
","
Sage is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is approved for food use as a spice or seasoning. However, some species of sage contain thujone, which can affect the nervous system. Extended use or taking large amounts of sage leaf or oil may result in restlessness, vomiting, vertigo, rapid heart rate, tremors, seizures, and kidney damage. Twelve drops or more of the essential oil is considered a toxic¬†dose.

45,Saw Palmetto,"
Common Names:¬†
  saw palmetto, American dwarf palm tree, cabbage¬†palm","Saw palmetto is a small palm tree native to the southeastern United States. Its fruit was used medicinally by the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
Currently, saw palmetto is used as a dietary supplement for urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate gland (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), as well as for chronic pelvic pain, decreased sex drive, migraine, hair loss, and other conditions.
Extracts of the fruit of saw palmetto are used in tablets or capsules. Saw palmetto has also been used as ground, dried, or whole berries, a liquid extract, or a tea.","Rigorous, well-conducted studies have evaluated saw palmetto for urinary tract symptoms associated with prostate enlargement in men.
Much less is known about the use of saw palmetto as a dietary supplement for other health purposes or by other groups of people.","The scientific evidence does not support using saw palmetto for any health condition.
High-quality scientific studies have shown that saw palmetto is no more effective than a placebo (an inactive substance) in relieving urinary tract symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. These studies include a 2011 NIH-funded study that tested saw palmetto in amounts up to three times the usual dose.","Saw palmetto is well tolerated by most users. It may cause mild side effects, including digestive symptoms or headache.
Saw palmetto does not appear to affect readings of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, even when taken in higher-than-usual amounts. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. PSA levels have been used to screen for prostate cancer and are also used to monitor patients who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Saw palmetto has not been shown to interact with medications.
Information on the safety of saw palmetto comes primarily from studies in men. Little is known about the safety or side effects of saw palmetto in women or children.","[[], [{'S': [It], 'V': [cause], 'O': [mild_side_effects], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [], 'A': [including], 'C': [],

Common Name:¬†
  soy","This fact sheet focuses on the use of soy by adults for health purposes.
Soy, a plant in the pea family, has been common in Asian diets for thousands of years. Soy is also present in modern Western diets as a food and food ingredient.
Soy products are used for menopausal symptoms, bone health, improving memory, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.
In addition to its food uses, soy is available in dietary supplements, in forms such as tablets, capsules, and powders. Soy supplements may contain soy protein, isoflavones (compounds that have effects in the body similar to those of the female hormone estrogen), or other soy components.","Although there have been many studies on soy products, there are still uncertainties about soy’s health effects.","Consuming soy protein in place of other proteins may lower levels of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol to a small extent.
Soy isoflavone supplements may help to reduce the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes, but the effect may be small.
It’s uncertain whether soy supplements can relieve cognitive problems associated with menopause.
Current evidence suggests that soy isoflavone mixtures do not slow bone loss in Western women during or after menopause.
Diets containing soy protein may slightly reduce blood pressure.
There’s not enough scientific evidence to determine whether soy supplements are effective for any other health uses.
Current National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)-funded studies on soy and its components are investigating a variety of topics, including stroke outcomes, anti-inflammatory effects, and effects on diabetes.","Except for people with soy allergies, soy is believed to be safe when consumed in normal dietary amounts. However, the safety of long-term use of high doses of soy extracts has not been established.
The most common side effects of soy are digestive upsets, such as stomach pain and diarrhea.
Long-term use of soy isoflavone supplements might increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (a thickening of the lining of the uterus that may lead to cancer). Soy foods do not appear to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
Current evidence indicates that it’s safe for women who have had breast cancer or who are at risk for breast cancer to eat soy foods. However, it’s uncertain whether soy isoflavone supplements are safe for these women.","[[], [], [], [{'S': [term_use], 'V': [increase], 'O': [the_risk, thickening], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [], 'A': [of,

47,St. John's Wort,"
Common Names:¬†
  St. John‚Äôs wort, hypericum, Klamath weed,¬†goatweed","
St. John‚Äôs wort is a plant with yellow flowers that has been used in traditional European medicine as far back as the ancient Greeks. The name St. John‚Äôs wort apparently refers to John the Baptist, as the plant blooms around the time of the feast of St. John the Baptist in late¬†June.
Historically, St. John‚Äôs wort has been used for a variety of conditions, including kidney and lung ailments, insomnia, and depression, and to aid wound¬†healing.
Currently, St. John‚Äôs wort is most often used as a dietary supplement for depression. People also use it as a dietary supplement for other conditions, including menopausal symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is used topically for wound¬†healing.
The flowering tops of St. John‚Äôs wort are used to prepare teas, tablets, capsules, and liquid extracts. Topical preparations are also¬†available.
","
There has been extensive research on St. John‚Äôs wort, especially on its use for depression and on its interactions with medications. It has been clearly shown that St. John‚Äôs wort can interact in dangerous, sometimes life-threatening ways with a variety of¬†medicines.
","
The results of studies on the effectiveness of St. John‚Äôs wort for depression are mixed. For more information, see the NCCIH fact sheet St. John‚Äôs Wort and Depression.
St. John‚Äôs wort has also been studied for conditions other than depression. For some, such as ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, and quitting smoking, current evidence indicates that St. John‚Äôs wort is not helpful. For others, such as menopausal symptoms, premenstrual syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the evidence is¬†inconclusive.
","
St. John‚Äôs wort can weaken the effects of many medicines, including crucially important medicines such as

Antidepressants
Birth control¬†pills
Cyclosporine, which prevents the body from rejecting transplanted¬†organs
Digoxin, a heart¬†medication
Some HIV drugs including¬†indinavir
Some cancer medications including¬†irinotecan
Warfarin, an anticoagulant (blood¬†thinner).


Taking St. John‚Äôs wort with certain antidepressants or other drugs that affect serotonin, a substance produced by nerve cells, may lead to increased serotonin-related side effects, which may be potentially¬†serious.
St. John‚Äôs wort may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Other side effects can include anxiety, dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, headache, or sexual¬†dysfunction.

49,Thunder God Vine,"
Common Names:¬†
  thunder god vine, lei gong¬†teng","Thunder god vine is a perennial grown in China and Taiwan. It has been used for hundreds of years in traditional Chinese medicine to treat swelling caused by inflammation.
Currently, thunder god vine is used orally (by mouth) as a dietary supplement for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and lupus. It is also used topically for rheumatoid arthritis.
Extracts are prepared from the roots of thunder god vine.",A small number of studies have evaluated oral thunder god vine for rheumatoid arthritis. Very little research has been done on thunder god vine for other health conditions or on topical use of this herb for rheumatoid arthritis.,"There have been only a few high-quality studies of oral thunder god vine for rheumatoid arthritis in people. These studies indicate that thunder god vine may improve some rheumatoid arthritis symptoms.
Results from a small 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), which compared an extract of thunder god vine root with a conventional drug (sulfasalazine) for rheumatoid arthritis, found that participants’ symptoms (e.g., joint pain and swelling, inflammation) improved significantly more with thunder god vine than with the drug.
A study from China, published in 2014, compared thunder god vine to a conventional drug (methotrexate) and found that both were comparably helpful in relieving rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, and that the combination of the herb and the drug was better than either one alone.
There is not enough evidence to show whether thunder god vine is helpful for any health conditions other than rheumatoid arthritis or whether its topical use in rheumatoid arthritis has any benefits.","Thunder god vine may have side effects, including decreased bone mineral content (with long-term use), infertility, menstrual cycle changes, rashes, diarrhea, headache, and hair loss. Because some of these side effects are serious, the risks of using thunder god vine may be greater than its benefits.
Thunder god vine can be extremely poisonous if the extract is not prepared properly.","[[{'S': [Thunder_god_vine], 'V': [have], 'O': [side_effects], 'IO': [], 'XCOMP': [], 'C': [have], 'type': 'SVOC',

50,Turmeric,"
Common Names:¬†
  turmeric, turmeric root, Indian¬†saffron","
Turmeric, a plant related to ginger, is grown throughout India, other parts of Asia, and Central¬†America.
Historically, turmeric has been used in Ayurvedic medicine, primarily in South Asia, for many conditions, including breathing problems, rheumatism, serious pain, and¬†fatigue.
Today, turmeric is used as a dietary supplement for inflammation; arthritis; stomach, skin, liver, and gallbladder problems; cancer; and other¬†conditions.
Turmeric is a common spice and a major ingredient in curry powder. Its primary active ingredients, curcuminoids, are yellow and used to color foods and¬†cosmetics.
Turmeric‚Äôs underground stems (rhizomes) are dried and made into capsules, tablets, teas, or extracts. Turmeric powder is also made into a paste for skin¬†conditions.
","
We have a lot of research, including studies done in people, on turmeric for a variety of health¬†conditions.
","
Claims that curcuminoids found in turmeric help to reduce inflammation aren‚Äôt supported by strong¬†studies.
Preliminary studies found that curcuminoids may

Reduce the number of heart attacks bypass patients had after¬†surgery
Control knee pain from osteoarthritis as well as ibuprofen¬†did
Reduce the skin irritation that often occurs after radiation treatments for breast¬†cancer.


Other preliminary studies in people have looked at curcumin, a type of curcuminoid, for different cancers, colitis, diabetes, surgical pain, and as an ingredient in mouthwash for reducing¬†plaque.
The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has studied curcumin for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and prostate and colon¬†cancer.
","
Turmeric in amounts tested for health purposes is generally considered safe when taken by mouth or applied to the¬†skin.
High doses or long-term use of turmeric may cause gastrointestinal¬†problems.

51,Valerian,"
Common Names:¬†
  valerian, all-heal, garden¬†heliotrope","
Valerian is a plant native to Europe and Asia; it also grows in North¬†America.
Valerian has been used medicinally since the times of early Greece and Rome; Hippocrates wrote about its uses. Historically, valerian was used to treat nervousness, trembling, headaches, and heart¬†palpitations.
Today, valerian is used as a dietary supplement for insomnia, anxiety, and other conditions such as depression and menopause¬†symptoms.
The roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of valerian are used to make capsules, tablets, and liquid extracts, as well as¬†teas.
","
Knowledge about valerian is limited because there have been only a small number of high-quality studies in¬†people.
","
The evidence on whether valerian is helpful for sleep problems is¬†inconsistent.
There‚Äôs not enough evidence to allow any conclusions about whether valerian can relieve anxiety, depression, or menopausal¬†symptoms.
","
Studies suggest that valerian is generally safe for use by most healthy adults for short periods of¬†time.
No information is available about the long-term safety of valerian or its safety in children younger than age 3, pregnant women, or nursing¬†mothers.
Few side effects have been reported in studies of valerian. Those that have occurred include headache, dizziness, itching, and digestive¬†disturbances.
Because it is possible (though not proven) that valerian might have a sleep-inducing effect, it should not be taken along with alcohol or¬†sedatives.

Common Names:¬†
  yohimbe,¬†johimbe","
Yohimbe is an evergreen tree native to western Africa. It has a compound called yohimbine in its bark. The bark is used to make extracts, tablets, and¬†capsules.
In parts of Africa, tea made from yohimbe bark has been used as an aphrodisiac (to increase sexual¬†desire).
Yohimbe is used as a dietary supplement for impotence, athletic performance, weight loss, chest pain, high blood pressure, diabetic neuropathy, and¬†more.
Yohimbine hydrochloride, a standardized form of yohimbine, is available in the United States as a prescription drug for erectile dysfunction. This is a different product than dietary supplements made from the bark of the¬†tree.
","
There is very little research in people on the effects of yohimbe as a dietary supplement. But studies have documented the risks of taking¬†it.
","
The amount of yohimbine in dietary supplements may vary; some yohimbe products contain very little¬†yohimbine.
Yohimbe sold as a dietary supplement may not work like the prescription medication that contains¬†yohimbine.
","
Yohimbe has been associated with heart attacks and¬†seizures.
Yohimbe caused stomach problems, tachycardia (a rapid heartbeat), anxiety, and high blood pressure, according to a study comparing calls about yohimbe and other substances made to the California Poison Control System between 2000 and 2006. People calling about yohimbe were generally more likely to need medical care than other¬†callers.
Most yohimbe products don‚Äôt say how much yohimbine they contain. The amount may vary a lot among products, according to a recent analysis of 49 brands of supplements labeled as containing yohimbe or yohimbine for sale in the United States. Some of the yohimbine was either synthetic or from highly processed plant¬†extract.
