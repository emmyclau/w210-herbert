Many eudicot species and cultivars are resistant to the disease and all monocots, gymnosperms and ferns are immune.
There are no fungicides characterized for the control of this disease but soil fumigation with chloropicrin has been proven successful in dramatically reducing Verticillium wilt in diverse crops such as vegetables using plasticulture production methods, and in potato production in North America (non-tarped).
Additional strategies to manage the disease include crop rotation, the use of resistant varieties and deep plowing (to accelerate the decomposition of infected plant residue).
In recent years, pre-plant soil fumigation with chloropicrin in non-tarped, raised beds has proven to be economically viable and beneficial for reducing wilt disease and increasing yield and quality of potato in North America."

It is native to Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia.
Its distribution extends from Great Britain in the west to western Ukraine and the Iranian province of Gilan in the east.
These tropane alkaloids appear to be common in the family Solanaceae, as they are also present in plants of the genera Brugmansia, Datura and Hyoscyamus, of the same family but in different subfamilies and tribes than the nightshade.
Atropa belladonna has unpredictable effects.
The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.It has a long history of use as a medicine, cosmetic, and poison.
The name belladonna is derived from Italian for ""beautiful woman"", as during the Renaissance, the herb was used in eyedrops by women to dilate the pupils of the eyes to make them appear seductive."
benincasae semen,List of kampo herbs,"In 1967, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved four kampo medicines for reimbursement under the National Health Insurance (NHI) program.
In 1976, 82 kampo medicines were approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
Currently, 148 kampo medicines are approved for reimbursement.
The 14th edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) (日本薬局方 Nihon yakkyokuhō) lists 165 herbal ingredients that are approved to be used in kampo remedies.

benzoin,Benzoin (organic compound),"Benzoin ( or ) is an organic compound with the formula PhCH(OH)C(O)Ph.  It is a hydroxy ketone attached to two phenyl groups. It appears as off-white crystals, with a light camphor-like odor. Benzoin is synthesized from benzaldehyde in the benzoin condensation.  It is chiral and it exists as a pair of enantiomers: (R)-benzoin and (S)-benzoin.
Benzoin is not a constituent of benzoin resin obtained from the benzoin tree (Styrax) or tincture of benzoin. The main component in these natural products is benzoic acid."
berberine,berberine,"Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids found in such plants as Berberis (e.g. Berberis vulgaris – barberry, Berberis aristata – tree turmeric, Mahonia aquifolium – Oregon-grape, Hydrastis canadensis – goldenseal, Xanthorhiza simplicissima – yellowroot, Phellodendron amurense – Amur cork tree, Coptis chinensis – Chinese goldthread, Tinospora cordifolia, Argemone mexicana – prickly poppy, and Eschscholzia californica – Californian poppy). Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark.Due to berberine's strong yellow color, Berberis species were used to dye wool, leather, and wood.  Wool is still dyed with berberine in northern India. Under ultraviolet light, berberine shows a strong yellow fluorescence, so it is useful in histology for staining heparin in mast cells. As a natural dye, berberine has a color index of 75160."
beta-carotene,beta-carotene,"β-Carotene is an organic, strongly colored red-orange pigment abundant in plants and fruits.
It is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons.
Among the carotenes, β-carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule.
β-Carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.β-Carotene is the most common form of carotene in plants.
When used as a food coloring, it has the E number E160a.
In nature, β-carotene is a precursor (inactive form) to vitamin A via the action of beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase.Isolation of β-carotene from fruits abundant in carotenoids is commonly done using column chromatography.
It can also be extracted from the beta-carotene rich algae, Dunaliella salina.
The separation of β-carotene from the mixture of other carotenoids is based on the polarity of a compound.
β-Carotene is a non-polar compound, so it is separated with a non-polar solvent such as hexane."
bifidobacteria,bifidobacteria,"Bifidobacterium is a genus of gram-positive, nonmotile, often branched anaerobic bacteria.  They are ubiquitous inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract, vagina and mouth (B. dentium) of mammals, including humans.  Bifidobacteria are one of the major genera of bacteria that make up the gastrointestinal tract microbiota in mammals. Some bifidobacteria are used as probiotics.
Before the 1960s, Bifidobacterium species were collectively referred to as ""Lactobacillus bifidus""."
biond’s magnolia flower,biond’s magnolia flower,"Magnolia biondii (Biondi’s magnolia) is a deciduous tree that flowers in late winter to early spring before leaf growth. Its early flowering nature gives it the name of the Hope for Spring Flower. It is a member of the family Magnoliaceae, which consists of more than 210 species. It is widely found in northern China. It produces small white flowers every few years. Leave buds and petals of the plant are used to alleviate nasal obstruction and coughing in some parts of China."
biota seed,biota seed,"The Meyer Desert Formation biota is a biota (flora and fauna) found in the Dominion Range in the Transantarctic Mountains in Antarctica, alongside the Beardmore Glacier.
Since about 15 Ma, Antarctica has been mostly covered with ice.Fossil Nothofagus leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the Sirius Group show that intermittent warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs to cling to the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late Pliocene).
After that the Pleistocene ice-age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.Species reported by Ashworth and Cantrill from about 3 million years ago include:
Pisidium species (very small or minute freshwater clams, Sphaeriidae)
2 species of curculionid beetles (weevils)
A cyclorrhaphid fly (Diptera)Plants:
Nothofagus beardmorensis (Fagales)
Mosses (apparently 5 types)

3 or more types of liverworts"
biotin,biotin,"Biotin, also called vitamin H (the H represents Haar and Haut, German words for ""hair and skin"") or vitamin B7, is a water-soluble B vitamin. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids.
Biotin deficiency can be caused by inadequate dietary intake or inheritance of one or more inborn genetic disorders that affect biotin metabolism. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency began in the United States in 1984, with many countries testing for this disorder at birth. Individuals born prior to 1984 are unlikely to have been screened, obscuring the true prevalence of the disorder."
bitter apricot seed,bitter apricot seed,"However, studies have found the compounds to be ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to cyanide poisoning.Apricot kernels can cause potentially fatal cyanide poisoning when consumed.
Symptoms include nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, increased thirst, lethargy, nervousness, various aches and pains in joints and muscles, and a drop in blood pressure.Apricot kernels are sometimes added to soaps or scrubs as an exfoliant.In 1993 the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets tested the cyanide content of two 220 gram (8 oz) packages of bitter apricot kernels imported from Pakistan that were being sold in health-food stores as a snack.
There was one reported case in the medical literature of cyanide toxicity from apricot kernels from 1979 to 1998 in the United States, a non-fatal poisoning by purchased apricot kernels."
bitter melon,bitter melon,"Momordica charantia (colloquially: bitter melon; bitter apple; bitter gourd; bitter squash; balsam-pear; with many more names listed below) is a tropical and subtropical vine of the family Cucurbitaceae, widely grown in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean for its edible fruit. Its many varieties differ substantially in the shape and bitterness of the fruit.
Bitter melon originated from the South Indian state of Kerala and was introduced into China in the 14th century. It is widely used in the cuisines of East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia."
bitter orange flower,bitter orange flower,"Bitter orange, Seville orange, sour orange, bigarade orange, or marmalade orange refers to a citrus tree (Citrus × aurantium) and its fruit. It is native to southeast Asia and has been spread by humans to many parts of the world. Wild trees are found near small streams in generally secluded and wooded parts of Florida and The Bahamas after it was introduced to the area from Spain, where it had been introduced and cultivated heavily beginning in the 10th century by the Moors. The bitter orange is believed to be a cross between the Pomelo, Citrus maxima, and the Mandarin orange, Citrus reticulata."
bitter orange seed,bitter orange seed,"The trifoliate orange, Citrus trifoliata or Poncirus trifoliata, is a member of the family Rutaceae. Whether the species should be considered to belong to its own genus, Poncirus or included in the genus Citrus is debated. The species is unusual among citrus for having deciduous, compound leaves and pubescent (downy) fruit. The trifolate orange was long viewed as the sole member of Poncirus, until the discovery of a second species, Poncirus polyandra, in Yunnan (China) in the 1980s.It is native to northern China and Korea, and is also known as the Japanese bitter-orange, hardy orange or Chinese bitter orange.
The plant is a fairly cold-hardy citrus (USDA zone 6) and will tolerate moderate frost and snow, making a large shrub or small tree 4–8 m tall. Because of its relative hardiness, citrus grafted onto Citrus trifoliata are usually hardier than when grown on their own roots."
black bean,Black adzuki bean,"Black adzuki beans are adzuki beans (Vigna angularis) that are black.In Korean, they are called geomeunpat (검은팥; ""black adzuki beans""), geomjeongpat (검정팥; ""black adzuki beans""), heukdu (흑두; 黑豆; ""black beans""), or heuksodu (흑소두; 黑小豆; ""black small beans""). Gugeupbang eonhae, a 1466 medical book, mentions it using the name geomeunpɑt (거믄).It has thinner skin compared to regular (red) adzuki beans, thus it is often husked prior to cooking, which gave this cultivar the name geopipat (거피팥; ""dehulled adzuki beans""). White adzuki bean powder and white adzuki bean paste made from husked black adzuki beans are called geopipat-gomul and geopipat-so respectively and are used in Korean rice cakes and confections.Confusingly, the Japanese Okinawan kuroazuki (黒小豆; ""black adzuki beans"") are not adzuki beans, but black cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)."
black pepper,black pepper,"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice and seasoning.
Peppercorns and the ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).Black pepper is native to present-day Kerala in South India, and is extensively cultivated there and elsewhere in tropical regions.
Vietnam is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's crop, as of 2013.
Ground dried and cooked peppercorns have been used since antiquity, both for flavour and as a traditional medicine.
Black pepper is the world's most traded spice, and is one of the most common spices added to cuisines around the world."
black psyllium,black psyllium,"Psyllium , or ispaghula (isabgol)  , is the common name used for several members of the plant genus Plantago whose seeds are used commercially for the production of mucilage. Psyllium is mainly used as a dietary fiber to relieve symptoms of both constipation and mild diarrhea, and occasionally as a food thickener. It is commonly used as a food ingredient in manufactured breakfast cereals which may contribute to a healthy lifestyle by improving blood cholesterol levels and gastrointestinal function.Use of psyllium in the diet for three weeks or longer lowers blood cholesterol levels in people with elevated cholesterol, and lowers blood glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Use of psyllium for a month or longer produces a small reduction in systolic blood pressure.The plants from which the seeds are extracted tolerate dry and cool climates and are mainly cultivated in northern India."
black sesame,black sesame,"Sesame (; Sesamum indicum) is a flowering plant in the genus Sesamum, also called benne.
Numerous wild relatives occur in Africa and a smaller number in India.
It is widely naturalized in tropical regions around the world and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which grow in pods.
World production in 2016 was 6.1 million tonnes, with Tanzania, Myanmar, India, and Sudan as the largest producers.Sesame seed is one of the oldest oilseed crops known, domesticated well over 3000 years ago.
Sesamum has many other species, most being wild and native to sub-Saharan Africa.
S. indicum, the cultivated type, originated in India and is tolerant to drought-like conditions, growing where other crops fail.Sesame has one of the highest oil contents of any seed.
With a rich, nutty flavor, it is a common ingredient in cuisines across the world.
Like other nuts and foods, it can trigger allergic reactions in some people."
black tea,black tea,"Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green, and white teas.
Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than the less oxidized teas.
All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis.
Two principal varieties of the species are used – the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C.
sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C.
sinensis var.
assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced.
In China, where black tea was discovered, the beverage is called ""red tea"" due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately.While green tea usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea retains its flavour for several years.
Black tea accounts for over 90% of all tea sold in the West."
blessed thistle,blessed thistle,"Silybum marianum has other common names including cardus marianus, milk thistle, blessed milkthistle, Marian thistle, Mary thistle, Saint Mary's thistle, Mediterranean milk thistle, variegated thistle and Scotch thistle (though not to be confused with Onopordum acanthium). This species is an annual or biennial plant of the family Asteraceae. This fairly typical thistle has red to purple flowers and shiny pale green leaves with white veins. Originally a native of Southern Europe through to Asia, it is now found throughout the world."
bletilla striata rchb.f.,bletilla striata rchb.f.,"Bletilla striata, known as hyacinth orchid or Chinese ground orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae, native to Japan, Korea, Myanmar (Burma), and China (Anhui, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang).It forms a clump 50 centimetres (20 in) tall and wide, with sword-shaped leaves and bright pink flowers in Spring. 
The Latin specific epithet striata means “striped”, in reference to the ribbed leaves."
blond psyllium,blond psyllium,"Plantago ovata, known by many common names including blond plantain, desert Indianwheat, blond psyllium, and ispaghul, is a medicinal plant native to Western Asia and Southern Asia. The plant can be found growing wild in the southwestern United States, where it is considered a possibly  introduced species.It is a common source of psyllium, a type of dietary fiber. Psyllium seed husks are indigestible and are a source of soluble fiber which may be fermented into butyrate – a pharmacologically active short-chain fatty acid – by butyrate-producing bacteria.."
blue-green algae,blue-green algae,"Cyanobacteria , also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum consisting of free-living bacteria and the endosymbiotic plastids, a sister group to Gloeomargarita, that are present in some eukaryotes.
The oxygen gas in the atmosphere of earth is produced by cyanobacteria of this phylum, either as free-living bacteria or as the endosymbiotic plastids.
Cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes, are also called ""blue-green algae"", though some modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes.
These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed.Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in cyanobacteria, acquired long ago via a process called endosymbiosis.
These endosymbiotic cyanobacteria in eukaryotes then evolved and differentiated into specialized organelles such as chloroplasts, etioplasts and leucoplasts."
blueberry,blueberry,"Blueberries are perennial flowering plants with blue– or purple–colored berries.
Vaccinium also includes cranberries, bilberries, huckleberries and Madeira blueberries.
Commercial ""blueberries"" – including both wild ('lowbush') and cultivated ('highbush') blueberries – are all native to North America.
The highbush blueberry varieties were introduced into Europe during the 1930s.Blueberries are usually prostrate shrubs that can vary in size from 10 centimeters (3.9 in) to 4 meters (13 ft) in height.
In commercial production of blueberries, the species with small, pea–size berries growing on low–level bushes are known as ""lowbush blueberries"" (synonymous with ""wild""), while the species with larger berries growing on taller cultivated bushes are known as ""highbush blueberries"".
The flowers are bell-shaped, white, pale pink or red, sometimes tinged greenish.
The fruit is a berry 5–16 millimeters (0.20–0.63 in) in diameter with a flared crown at the end; they are pale greenish at first, then reddish-purple, and finally dark purple when ripe."
bombyx mori l.,bombyx mori l.,"Bombyx mori, the domestic silkmoth, is an insect from the moth family Bombycidae.
It is the closest relative of Bombyx mandarina, the wild silkmoth.
Wild silkmoths are different from their domestic cousins as they have not been selectively bred; they are thus not as commercially viable in the production of silk.
Sericulture, the practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China, whence it spread to India, Korea, Japan, and the West.
The domestic silkmoth was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina, which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia.
mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.Domestic silkmoths are very different from most members in the genus Bombyx; not only have they lost the ability to fly, but their color pigments have also been lost."
borneol,borneol,Borneol is a bicyclic organic compound and a terpene derivative. The hydroxyl group in this compound is placed in an endo position.  There are two different enantiomers of borneol. Both d-(+)-borneol and l-(–)-borneol are found in nature.
boron,boron,"Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.
Elemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth.
Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements.
The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.
The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials.
Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known.
Boron is an essential plant nutrient and boron compounds such as borax and boric acid are used as fertilizers in agriculture, although it's only required in small amounts, with excess being toxic."
broussonetiae fructus,Diplodia,Diplodia is a genus of anamorphic fungi in the family Botryosphaeriaceae.
brown mustard seed,brown mustard seed,"Mustard seeds are the small round seeds of various mustard plants. The seeds are usually about 1 to 2 millimetres (0.039 to 0.079 in) in diameter and may be colored from yellowish white to black. They are an important spice in many regional foods and may come from one of three different plants: black mustard (Brassica nigra), brown Indian mustard (B. juncea), or white/yellow mustard (B. hirta/Sinapis alba).
Grinding and mixing the seeds with water, vinegar or other liquids creates the yellow condiment known as prepared mustard."
buckeye seed,buckeye seed,"The genus Aesculus ( or ), with varieties called buckeye and horse chestnut, comprises 13–19 species of flowering plants in the soapberry and lychee family, Sapindaceae. They are trees and shrubs native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with six species native to North America and seven to thirteen species native to Eurasia. Also, several hybrids occur. Aesculus exhibits a classical Arcto-Tertiary distribution.Carl Linnaeus named the genus Aesculus after the Roman name for an edible acorn. Common names for these trees include ""buckeye"" and ""horse chestnut"", though they are not in the same order as chestnut trees. Some are also called white chestnut or red chestnut. In Britain, they are sometimes called conker trees because of their link with the game of conkers, played with the seeds, also called conkers."
buddha's hand,buddha's hand,"Citrus medica var. sarcodactylis, or the fingered citron, is an unusually shaped citron variety whose fruit is segmented into finger-like sections, resembling those seen on representations of Buddha. It is called Buddha's hand in Chinese (佛手柑), Japanese (仏手柑), Korean (불수감) and Vietnamese (Phật thủ).
The different cultivars and variations of this citron variety form a gradient from ""open-hand"" types with outward-splayed segments to ""closed-hand"" types, in which the fingers are kept together. There are also half-fingered fruits, in which the basal side is united and the apical side fingered. The origin of this kind of citron is commonly traced back to the Far East, probably northeastern India or China, where most domesticated citrus fruits originate."
bugbane rhizome,Actaea racemosa,"Actaea racemosa (black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, fairy candle; syn. Cimicifuga racemosa) is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. The roots and rhizomes were used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Although its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines and dietary supplements, black cohosh is not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease."

bush cherry pit,bush cherry pit,"A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).
Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in ""ornamental cherry"" or ""cherry blossom"". Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name ""wild cherry"" in the British Isles."
calendula,calendula,"Calendula (),  is a genus of about 15–20 species of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the daisy family Asteraceae that are often known as marigolds. They are native to southwestern Asia, western Europe, Macaronesia, and the Mediterranean. Other plants are also known as marigolds, such as corn marigold, desert marigold, marsh marigold, and plants of the genus Tagetes.
The genus name Calendula is a modern Latin diminutive of calendae, meaning ""little calendar"", ""little clock"" or possibly ""little weather-glass"".  The common name ""marigold""  refers to the Virgin Mary.
The most commonly cultivated and used member of the genus is the pot marigold (Calendula officinalis). Popular herbal and cosmetic products named 'calendula' invariably derive from C. officinalis."
calendula officilis,calendula officilis,"Calendula officinalis, the pot marigold, ruddles, common marigold or Scotch marigold, is a plant in the genus Calendula of the family Asteraceae. It is probably native to southern Europe, though its long history of cultivation makes its precise origin unknown, and it may possibly be of garden origin. It is also widely naturalised farther north in Europe (as far as southern England) and elsewhere in warm temperate regions of the world.The Latin specific epithet officinalis refers to the plant's medical and herbal uses."
calyx and receptacle of a persimmon,calyx and receptacle of a persimmon,"In botany, a berry is a fleshy fruit without a stone produced from a single flower containing one ovary.
The berry is the most common type of fleshy fruit in which the entire outer layer of the ovary wall ripens into a potentially edible ""pericarp"".
Berries may be formed from one or more carpels from the same flower (i.e. from a simple or a compound ovary).
Many berries are edible, but others, such as the fruits of the potato and the deadly nightshade, are poisonous to humans.
A plant that bears berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate (a fruit that resembles a berry, whether it actually is a berry or not, can also be called ""baccate"").
In everyday English, a ""berry"" is any small edible fruit.
Berries are usually juicy, round, brightly coloured, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present."
calyx seu fructus physalis,Chinese herbology,"Chinese herbology (simplified Chinese: 中药学; traditional Chinese: 中藥學; pinyin: zhōngyào xué) is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
A Nature editorial described TCM as ""fraught with pseudoscience"", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized, among which some are poisonous.
Thus, the term ""medicinal"" (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (pinyin: yào).Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy.
There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs."
camphor,camphor,"Camphor () is a waxy, flammable, transparent solid with a strong aroma.
It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), a large evergreen tree found in Asia (particularly in Sumatra and Borneo islands, Indonesia) and also of the unrelated kapur tree, a tall timber tree from the same region.
It also occurs in some other related trees in the laurel family, notably Ocotea usambarensis.
The oil in rosemary leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis), in the mint family, contains 10 to 20% camphor, while camphorweed (Heterotheca) only contains some 5%.
Camphor can also be synthetically produced from oil of turpentine.
A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil (the parent of African blue basil).
The molecule has two possible enantiomers as shown in the structural diagrams.
The structure on the left is the naturally occurring (R)-form, while its mirror image shown on the right is the (S)-form."
cannabidiol ,cannabidiol ,"In 2018, clinical research on cannabidiol included preliminary studies of anxiety, cognition, movement disorders, and pain.Cannabidiol can be taken into the body in multiple ways, including by inhalation of cannabis smoke or vapor, as an aerosol spray into the cheek, and by mouth.
It may be supplied as CBD oil containing only CBD as the active ingredient (no included tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] or terpenes), a full-plant CBD-dominant hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, or as a prescription liquid solution.
As of 2018, the mechanism of action for its biological effects has not been determined.In the United States, the cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2018 for the treatment of two epilepsy disorders.
Since cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, other CBD formulations remain illegal to prescribe for medical use or to use as an ingredient in foods or dietary supplements."
canton love-pea vine,canton love-pea vine,"Kudzu (; also called Japanese arrowroot) is a group of plants in the genus Pueraria, in the pea family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae. They are climbing, coiling, and trailing perennial vines native to much of eastern Asia, Southeast Asia, and some Pacific islands. The name is derived from the Japanese name for the plant East Asian arrowroot (Pueraria montana var. lobata), クズ or 葛 (kuzu). Where these plants are naturalized, they can be invasive and are considered noxious weeds. The plant climbs over trees or shrubs and grows so rapidly that it kills them by heavy shading. The plant is edible, but often sprayed with herbicides."
cape jasmine fruit,cape jasmine fruit,"Gardenia is a genus of flowering plants in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Madagascar and Pacific Islands.The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus and John Ellis after Dr. Alexander Garden (1730–1791), a Scottish-born American naturalist.They are evergreen shrubs and small trees growing to 1–15 metres (3.3–49.2 ft) tall.
The flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white, or pale yellow, with a tubular-based corolla with 5–12 lobes (petals) from 5 to 12 centimetres (2.0 to 4.7 in) diameter.
Many of the native gardenias of the Pacific Islands and elsewhere in the paleotropics possess a diverse array of natural products.
Methoxylated and oxygenated flavonols, flavones, and triterpenes accumulate on the vegetative- and floral-buds as yellow to brown droplets of secreted resin.

Frangula purshiana, Rhamnus purshianus) is a species of buckthorn native to western North America from southern British Columbia south to central California, and eastward to northwestern Montana.
The dried bark of cascara has been used for centuries as a laxative, first by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, and then by white settlers. The chemicals primarily responsible for the laxative action are the hydroxyanthracene glycosides (particularly cascarosides A, B, C and D), and emodin. These act as stimulant laxatives, with the hydroanthracene glycosides stimulating peristalsis, and emodin exciting smooth muscle cells in the large intestine."
cassia seed,Cinnamomum cassia,"Cinnamomum cassia, called Chinese cassia or Chinese cinnamon, is an evergreen tree originating in southern China, and widely cultivated there and elsewhere in southern and eastern Asia (India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam). It is one of several species of Cinnamomum used primarily for their aromatic bark, which is used as a spice. The buds are also used as a spice, especially in India, and were once used by the ancient Romans.
The tree grows to 10–15 m (33–49 ft) tall, with greyish bark and hard, elongated leaves that are 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) long and have a decidedly reddish colour when young."
castor bean,castor bean,"Ricinus communis, the castor bean or castor oil plant, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.
It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae.
It reproduces with a mixed pollination system which favors selfing by geitonogamy but at the same time can be an out-crosser by anemophily (wind pollination) or entomophily (insect pollination).Its seed is the castor bean, which, despite its name, is not a true bean.
Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses.
The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein.
The seed also contains ricin, a water-soluble toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.
An unrelated plant species, Fatsia japonica (false castor oil plant), is similar in appearance but is from Japan."

caulis sinomenii,Reuptake enhancer,"A reuptake enhancer (RE), also sometimes referred to as a reuptake activator, is a type of reuptake modulator which enhances the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron, leading to a decrease in the extracellular concentrations of the neurotransmitter and therefore a decrease in neurotransmission.
The antidepressant tianeptine was once claimed to be a (selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer (SRE or SSRE), but the role of serotonin reuptake in its mechanism is doubtful.
Tianeptine has no affinity for the serotonin transporter, neither increases nor decreases extracellular levels of serotonin in cortico-limbic structures of conscious rats, and it didn't show any other long-term effect on the serotonin pathway.
Thus, tianeptine's role as an SSRE may have been the coincidence of a yet unknown mechanism of action.
The flavone luteoline as well as some of its derivatives enhance the reuptake at the dopamine transporter, extracts of Caulis Sinomenii activate DA/NE transporters."

cherokee rose fruit,cherokee rose fruit,"It was one of the first of the darker color group of tomatoes sometimes described as ""blacks""; the variety Purple Calabash, with its highly irregularly shaped fruits, arose in a very few seed catalogs in the mid 1900s.
In 1995, a skin color mutation of Cherokee Purple arose in Craig LeHoullier's North Carolina garden.
It was named Cherokee Chocolate, and the yellow skin gives the variety a brownish mahogany hue.
Cherokee Green arose in Craig's garden in 1997 from a planting of Cherokee Chocolate.
After growing the tomato in his 1991 garden, confirming the unique purplish coloration and considering the history shared by Mr Green, Craig named the variety Cherokee Purple and sent it to Jeff McCormack of Southern Exposure Seed Exchange.
Jeff enjoyed the flavor of the tomato and his company first listed the variety in its 1993 seed catalog."
chicory,chicory,"Common chicory, Cichorium intybus, is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant of the dandelion family Asteraceae, usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and food additive. In the 21st century, inulin, an extract from chicory root, has been used in food manufacturing as a sweetener and source of dietary fiber.Chicory is grown as a forage crop for livestock. It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and is now common in North America, China, and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized. ""Chicory"" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused."

They are usually called cinquefoils in English. Potentilla are generally only found throughout the northern continents of the world (holarctic), though some may even be found in montane biomes of the New Guinea Highlands. Several other cinquefoils formerly included here are now separated in distinct genera - notably the popular garden shrub P. fruticosa, now Dasiphora fruticosa.
Some species are called tormentils, though this is often used specifically for common tormentil (P. erecta). Others are referred to as barren strawberries, which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related but not congeneric Waldsteinia fragarioides."
chinese gall,chinese gall,"Rhus chinensis, the Chinese sumac, or nutgall tree, is a plant species in the genus Rhus.
Galls produced on the species that are called Chinese gall, Galla Chinensis, or Wu Bei Zi (五倍子) in Chinese, are a source of gallotannins, molecules of hydrolyzable tannins. Infestation of the tree by Chinese sumac aphids  (Melaphis chinensis Bell) may lead to production of a gall that is valued as a commercial product in China.
Chinese galls are used in traditional Chinese medicine for coughs, diarrhea, night sweats, dysentery, and intestinal and uterine bleeding.  Some research has suggested that chemical compounds found in Rhus chinensis possess in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, hepatoprotective, antidiarrheal, and antioxidant activities. However, it is important to note that this evidence is not substantiated by multiple international researchers.  The aqueous extracts of the gall also inhibit alpha-glucosidase activity in vitro."
chinese honeylocust abnormal fruit,chinese honeylocust abnormal fruit,"Galls (from Latin galla, 'oak-apple') or cecidia (from Greek kēkidion, anything gushing out) are a kind of swelling growth on the external tissues of plants, fungi, or animals. Plant galls are abnormal outgrowths of plant tissues, similar to benign tumors or warts in animals. They can be caused by various parasites, from viruses, fungi and bacteria, to other plants, insects and mites.  Plant galls are often highly organized structures so that the cause of the gall can often be determined without the actual agent being identified. This applies particularly to some insect and mite plant galls. The study of plant galls is known as cecidology.
In human pathology, a gall is a raised sore on the skin, usually caused by chafing or rubbing."
chinese lobelia herb,chinese lobelia herb,"Chinese herbology (simplified Chinese: 中药学; traditional Chinese: 中藥學; pinyin: zhōngyào xué) is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
A Nature editorial described TCM as ""fraught with pseudoscience"", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized, among which some are poisonous.
Thus, the term ""medicinal"" (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (pinyin: yào).Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy.
There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs."

clam shell,clam shell,"Clam is a common name for several kinds of bivalve molluscs.
The word is often applied only to those that are edible and live as infauna, spending most of their lives halfway buried in the sand of the seafloor.
Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot.
Clams in the culinary sense do not live attached to a substrate (whereas oysters and mussels do) and do not live near the bottom (whereas scallops do).
In culinary usage, clams are commonly eaten marine bivalves, as in clam digging and the resulting soup, clam chowder.
Many edible clams such as palourde clams are oval or triangular; however, razor clams have an elongated parallel-sided shell, suggesting an old-fashioned straight razor.Some clams have life cycles of only one year, while at least one may be over 500 years old.
All clams have two calcareous shells or valves joined near a hinge with a flexible ligament, and all are filter feeders."

Brother Cadfael made the oil.
Cadfael assesses the motives of Bonel's family and household staff, including his Welsh natural son and his stepson, and deals with Bonel's widow who was once Cadfael's sweetheart long ago.
The sergeant views the case differently from Cadfael.
The author was commended by one reviewer for her ability to draw characters who are distinctly medieval, ""not modern men and women masquerading in medieval garb,"" while dealing with fine points of medieval Welsh law.
Another reviewer missed the lively character of the second novel, Hugh Beringar, wishing him to be more involved in this plot, yet saying ""Peters does wonders with the medieval scene and with complex character relationships."""
common reed rhizome,common reed rhizome,"Sparganium eurycarpum is a species of bur-reed known by the common names broadfruit bur-reed and giant bur-reed.
It is a clonal perennial, spreading by below-ground rhizomes.
The common name, bur-reed, arises from the distinctive round clusters of fruits that take the form of a mace.
It can be distinguished from all other species of bur-reed by the presence of two stigmas.
This species frequently occurs in areas with spring flooding, and may be emersed during periods of lower water.
The buried rhizomes provide one method to survive periods of drought, fire, or ice scour.
It also produces large seeds, which can accumulate in the soil as buried reserves.
It can form dense stands under the right conditions; for example, Sparganium is one of the four main vegetation types in the Ottawa River, Canada.
Muskrats feed on the plant, particularly its rhizomes, while the seeds are an important food source for waterfowl.[1]"

It is widespread through tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas.Costus is often characterized and distinguished from relatives such as Zingiber (true ginger) by its spiraling stems.
The genus as a whole is thus often called spiral gingers, but this can also refer to C.
Costus spectabilis is the floral emblem of Nigeria; its flowers are represented (erroneously in red instead of yellow color) on its coat of arms.
It is important not to confuse Costus speciosus, C.

gambir stem and thorn,List of English words of Malay origin,"Some may also not directly derived from Malay into English, but through other languages, in particular, that of European powers that have exercised significant influence in the Maritime Southeast Asia.The adoption of various Malay terms began with contact between European powers and classical Malay sultanates in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century with the advent of British colonisation in the region.
Many of the earliest borrowing can be found in the accounts of early voyages during the age of discovery, when traders and travellers brought back products and objects of natural history from Maritime Southeast Asia which became known by their native names.
Over the time, with the flowering of English literature dealing with subjects native to the region, other words used to denote things and notions of Malay world and culture, have also made their way into English."

gelatin,gelatin,"Gelatin or gelatine (from Latin: gelatus meaning ""stiff"" or ""frozen"") is a translucent, colorless, flavorless food ingredient, derived from collagen taken from animal body parts.
It is brittle when dry and gummy when moist.
It may also be referred to as hydrolyzed collagen, collagen hydrolysate, gelatine hydrolysate, hydrolyzed gelatine, and collagen peptides after it has undergone hydrolysis.
It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, medications, drug and vitamin capsules, photographic films and papers, and cosmetics.
Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolyzed form of collagen, wherein the hydrolysis reduces protein fibrils into smaller peptides; depending on the physical and chemical methods of denaturation, the molecular weight of the peptides falls within a broad range.
Gelatin is in gelatin desserts; most gummy candy and marshmallows; and ice creams, dips, and yogurts.
Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others must soak in water beforehand."

gold coin herb,gold coin herb,"Alloyed gold coins, like the American Gold Eagle and South African Krugerrand, are typically 91.7% gold by weight, with the remainder being silver and copper.
Traditionally (up to about the 1930s), gold coins have been circulation coins, including coin-like bracteates and dinars.
Since recent decades, however, gold coins are mainly produced as bullion coins to investors and as commemorative coins to collectors.
While modern gold coins are also legal tender, they are not observed in everyday financial transactions, as the metal value normally exceeds the nominal value.
For example, the American Gold Eagle, given a denomination of 50 USD, has a metal value of more than $1,300 USD.
Gold is also easily transportable, as it has a high value-to-weight ratio, compared to other commodities, such as silver.
Gold can be re-coined, divided into smaller units, or re-melted into larger units such as gold bars, without destroying its metal value."

Guarana has large leaves and clusters of flowers and is best known for the seeds from its fruit, which are about the size of a coffee bean.
As a dietary supplement or herb, guarana seed is an effective stimulant: it contains about twice the concentration of caffeine found in coffee seeds (about 2–4.5% caffeine in guarana seeds, compared to 1–2% for coffee seeds).
As with other plants producing caffeine, the high concentration of caffeine is a defensive toxin that repels herbivores from the berry and its seeds.The colour of the fruit ranges from brown to red and it contains black seeds that are partly covered by white arils.
The colour contrast when the fruit is split open has been compared with the appearance of eyeballs and has become the basis of an origin myth among the Sateré-Mawé people."

honey,honey,"Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance made by bees and some related insects.
Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation.
Bees store honey in wax structures called  honeycombs.
The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.
Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture.
Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar).
Honey is regarded as safe when not taken in excessive amounts.Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity.
Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago."
honeycomb,honeycomb,"A honeycomb is a mass of hexagonal prismatic wax cells built by honey bees in their nests to contain their larvae and stores of honey and pollen.
Beekeepers may remove the entire honeycomb to harvest honey.
The structure of the comb may be left basically intact when honey is extracted from it by uncapping and spinning in a centrifugal machine—the honey extractor.
If the honeycomb is too worn out, the wax can be reused in a number of ways, including making sheets of comb foundation with hexagonal pattern.
Such foundation sheets allow the bees to build the comb with less effort, and the hexagonal pattern of worker-sized cell bases discourages the bees from building the larger drone cells.
Numerous wasps, especially Polistinae and Vespinae, construct hexagonal prism-packed combs made of paper instead of wax; in some species (such as Brachygastra mellifica), honey is stored in the nest, thus technically forming a paper honeycomb.
However, the term ""honeycomb"" is not often used for such structures."

Widely known species include Lonicera periclymenum (common honeysuckle or woodbine), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and Lonicera sempervirens (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). L. japonica is an aggressive, highly invasive species considered as a significant pest on the continents of North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa.Some species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially L. sempervirens and L. ciliosa (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name Lonicera stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist."
hops,hops,"The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and US) when grown commercially.
Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types used for particular styles of beer.
Before this period, brewers used a ""gruit"", composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including dandelion, burdock root, marigold, horehound (the old German name for horehound, Berghopfen, means ""mountain hops""), ground ivy, and heather.
Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the will of Charlemagne's father, Pepin III.Hops are also used in brewing for their antibacterial effect over less desirable microorganisms and for purported benefits including balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness and a variety of flavours and aromas."

Some Equisetopsida were large trees reaching to 30 meters tall.
The genus Calamites of the family Calamitaceae, for example, is abundant in coal deposits from the Carboniferous period.
The pattern of spacing of nodes in horsetails, wherein those toward the apex of the shoot are increasingly close together, inspired John Napier to invent logarithms.A superficially similar but entirely unrelated flowering plant genus, mare's tail (Hippuris), is occasionally referred to as ""horsetail"", and adding to confusion, the name mare's tail is sometimes applied to Equisetum.Despite centuries of use in traditional medicine, there is no evidence that Equisetum has any medicinal properties."

iodine,iodine,"Iodine is a chemical element with the symbol I and atomic number 53.
The heaviest of the stable halogens, it exists as a lustrous, purple-black non-metallic solid at standard conditions that melts to form a deep violet liquid at 114 degrees Celsius, and boils to a violet gas at 184 degrees Celsius.
It is the least abundant of the stable halogens, being the sixty-first most abundant element.
Iodine is essential in the synthesis of thyroid hormones.
The dominant producers of iodine today are Chile and Japan.
Iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition.
Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material.
Because of the specificity of its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine can also be used to treat thyroid cancer.
Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers."

They are climbing, coiling, and trailing perennial vines native to much of eastern Asia, Southeast Asia, and some Pacific islands. The name is derived from the Japanese name for the plant East Asian arrowroot (Pueraria montana var. lobata), クズ or 葛 (kuzu). Where these plants are naturalized, they can be invasive and are considered noxious weeds. The plant climbs over trees or shrubs and grows so rapidly that it kills them by heavy shading. The plant is edible, but often sprayed with herbicides."
kusnezoff monkshood leaf,History of general anesthesia,"Although there has been a great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.
Two major advances occurred in the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery.
Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology which led to the development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.
In the 20th century, the safety and efficacy of general anesthesia was improved by the routine use of tracheal intubation and other advanced airway management techniques.
The increased application of economic and business administration principles to health care in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to the introduction of management practices such as transfer pricing to improve the efficiency of anesthetists."
kusnezoff monkshood root,Aconitum,"Aconitum (), also known as aconite, monkshood, wolf's-bane, leopard's bane, mousebane, women's bane, devil's helmet, queen of poisons, or blue rocket, is a genus of over 250 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. These herbaceous perennial plants are chiefly native to the mountainous parts of the Northern Hemisphere, growing in the moisture-retentive but well-draining soils of mountain meadows. Most species are extremely poisonous and must be dealt with very carefully. Several Acontium hybrids, such as the Arendsii form of Aconitum carmichaelii, have won gardening awards — such as the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit. Some are used by florists."
l-arginine,l-arginine,"Arginine, also known as l-arginine (symbol Arg or R), is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.
It contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain ending in a guanidino group.
At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−COO−), the amino group is protonated (−NH3+), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH2)2+), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid.
It is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide.
Arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual.
Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them.
Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline."
l-tryptophan,l-tryptophan,"Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group,  an α-carboxylic acid group,  and a side chain indole, making it a non-polar aromatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it; it must be obtained from the diet. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin and vitamin B3. It is encoded by the codon UGG.
Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH3+; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38)."
lactobacillus,lactobacillus,"Lactobacillus is a  genus of Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic or microaerophilic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria.
They are a major part of the lactic acid bacteria group (i.e., they convert sugars to lactic acid).
In humans, they constitute a significant component of the microbiota at a number of body sites, such as the digestive system, urinary system, and genital system.
In women of European ancestry, Lactobacillus species are normally a major part of the vaginal microbiota.
Lactobacillus forms biofilms in the vaginal and gut microbiota, allowing them to persist during harsh environmental conditions and maintain ample populations.
Lactobacillus exhibits a mutualistic relationship with the human body, as it protects the host against potential invasions by pathogens, and in turn, the host provides a source of nutrients.
Lactobacillus is the most common probiotic found in food such as yogurt, and it is diverse in its application to maintain human well-being, as it can help treat diarrhea, vaginal infections, and skin disorders such as eczema."
leaf of leatherleaf mahonia,Mahonia bealei,"Mahonia bealei (Beale's barberry) is a shrub native to mainland China (Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang).
The berries are egg-shaped, dark purple and up to 15 mm long.First collected in China (Anhui) by Robert Fortune, the plants were taken to Shanghai, where they were lodged in the garden of Mr Beale to await transportation to Europe.
Fortune named the species after Beale in an issue of the Gardeners' Chronicle and was sure it was a distinct species, separate from Mahonia japonica.
However, Chronicle editor John Lindley, was unconvinced and repeatedly referred to the new species as Berberis (Mahonia) japonica.
bealei with silver undersides to the leaves have been recognized as the cultivar 'Silver Back', though the original Fortune plants lack this silver colouration; 'Silver Back' may represent a different species."
leafy twigs of oriental arborvitae,oriental arborvitae,"Platycladus is a distinct genus of evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae, containing only one species, Platycladus orientalis, also known as Chinese thuja, Oriental arborvitae, Chinese arborvitae, biota or oriental thuja.

Within its native range it is a relatively common plant where it grows in the understory in moist, rich woods, especially those with exposed limestone."
lingzhi mushroom,lingzhi mushroom,"The lingzhi mushroom is a polypore mushroom belonging to the genus Ganoderma. Its red-varnished, kidney-shaped cap gives it a distinct appearance. When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks gills on its underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores. Depending on the age of the mushroom, the pores on its underside may be white or brown.Lingzhi mushroom is used in traditional Chinese medicine. In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially that of the maple. Only two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is extremely rare. Today, lingzhi is effectively cultivated on hardwood logs or sawdust/woodchips."
lipase,lipase,"A lipase (, ) is any enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fats (lipids).
Lipases perform essential roles in digestion, transport and processing of dietary lipids (e.g. triglycerides, fats, oils) in most, if not all, living organisms.
Genes encoding lipases are even present in certain viruses.Most lipases act at a specific position on the glycerol backbone of a lipid substrate (A1, A2 or A3)(small intestine).
For example, human pancreatic lipase (HPL), which is the main enzyme that breaks down dietary fats in the human digestive system, converts triglyceride substrates found in ingested oils to monoglycerides and two fatty acids.
Several other types of lipase activities exist in nature, such as phospholipases  and sphingomyelinases; however, these are usually treated separately from ""conventional"" lipases.
Some lipases are expressed and secreted by pathogenic organisms during an infection.
In particular, Candida albicans has many different lipases, possibly reflecting broad-lipolytic activity, which may contribute to the persistence and virulence of C."
liquorice,liquorice,"Liquorice (British English) or licorice (American English) ( LIK-ər-is(h)) is the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a sweet flavour can be extracted. The liquorice plant is a herbaceous perennial legume native to the Middle East, southern Europe, and parts of Asia, such as India. It is not botanically related to anise, star anise, or fennel, which are sources of similar flavouring compounds. Liquorice flavours are used as candies or sweeteners, particularly in some European and Middle Eastern countries.
Liquorice extracts have been used in herbalism and traditional medicine. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than 2 mg/kg/day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a liquorice component) may result in adverse effects, such as hypokalemia, increased blood pressure, and muscle weakness."

Long pepper has a taste similar to, but hotter than, that of its close relative Piper nigrum – from which black, green and white pepper are obtained.
The fruit of the pepper consists of many minuscule fruits – each about the size of a poppy seed – embedded in the surface of a flower spike that closely resembles a hazel tree catkin. Like Piper nigrum, the fruits contain the alkaloid piperine, which contributes to their pungency. Another species of long pepper, Piper retrofractum, is native to Java, Indonesia. The fruits of this plant are often confused with chili peppers, which belong to the genus Capsicum, originally from the Americas."
long-stamen onion bulb,Allium hoffmanii,"Allium hoffmanii is a species of wild onion known by the common name beegum onion. It is native to northern California, where it grows in the serpentine soils of the local mountain ranges in Siskiyou, Humboldt, Trinity, Shasta, and Tehama Counties.This onion grows a short stem up to about 10 centimeters tall from a brown or reddish bulb one or two centimeters long. There is generally a single leaf which may be longer than the stem. The inflorescence is packed with up to 40 flowers, each about a centimeter long and pink or purple in color with greenish veining.

The fruit of the longan are similar to that of the lychee, but less aromatic in taste.
It is native to Southern Asia.The longan (from Cantonese lùhng-ngáahn 龍眼, literally 'dragon eye'), is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris).
The seed is small, round and hard, and of an enamel-like, lacquered black.
The fully ripened, freshly harvested fruit has a bark-like shell, thin, and firm, making the fruit easy to peel by squeezing the pulp out as if one were  ""cracking"" a sunflower seed.
The tenderness of the shell varies due to either premature harvest, variety, weather conditions, or transport/storage conditions."

Although lycopene is chemically a carotene, it has no vitamin A activity.
Foods that are not red may also contain lycopene, such as asparagus and parsley.In plants, algae, and other photosynthetic organisms, lycopene is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection.
Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a tetraterpene.
Eleven conjugated double bonds give lycopene its deep red color.
Owing to the strong color, lycopene is useful as a food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for use in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the European Union."

malt,malt,"Malt is germinated cereal grain that has been dried in a process known as ""malting"".
The grain is made to germinate by soaking in water and is then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air.Malting grain develops the enzymes (α-amylase, β-amylase) required for modifying the grains' starches into various types of sugar, including monosaccharide glucose, disaccharide maltose, trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines.
It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, that break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast.
The point at which the malting process is stopped affects the starch to enzyme ratio and partly converted starch becomes fermentable sugars.
Malted grain that has been ground into a coarse meal is known as ""sweet meal"".Various cereals are malted, though barley is the most common.

manganese,manganese,"Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses, particularly in stainless steels.
Historically, manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite.
Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it.
Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.
Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions.
Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.
Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen."

notoginseng flos,Chinese herbology,"Chinese herbology (simplified Chinese: 中药学; traditional Chinese: 中藥學; pinyin: zhōngyào xué) is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
A Nature editorial described TCM as ""fraught with pseudoscience"", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized, among which some are poisonous.
Thus, the term ""medicinal"" (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (pinyin: yào).Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy.
There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs."
notopterygium root,notopterygium root,"The Notopterygium Root, Notopterygium incisum, is perennial herb native to China.  Its root and rhizome parts of the plant have long been used for their medicinal properties, and the plant continues to be thoroughly studied to this day.  As a result of its use in traditional Chinese medicine, it has become endangered due to excessive cultivation for use in commercial products."
nutmeg,nutmeg,"Nutmeg is the seed or ground spice of several species of the genus Myristica. Myristica fragrans (fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree cultivated for two spices derived from its fruit: nutmeg, from its seed, and mace, from the seed covering. It is also a commercial source of an essential oil and nutmeg butter. The California nutmeg, Torreya californica, has a seed of similar appearance, but is not closely related to Myristica fragans, and is not used as a spice. If consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice, nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or have psychoactive effects. Although used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, nutmeg has no known medicinal value."

The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa.
North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic.
The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.
Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring.
In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers.
The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus."
odoriferous rosewood,odoriferous rosewood,"Perfume (UK: , US: ; French: parfum) is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents, used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces an agreeable scent.
It is usually in liquid form and used to give a pleasant scent to a person's body.
Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone."
olive,olive,"The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning ""European olive"", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands and Réunion.

oscillococcinum,oscillococcinum,"Oscillococcinum  (or Oscillo) is a homeopathic preparation fraudulently marketed to relieve flu-like symptoms.
Oscillococcinum was originally proposed by the French physician  Joseph Roy, based on his misidentification of a supposed oscillating bacterium he named oscillococcus in victims of the Spanish flu epidemic of 1917-1918.
Roy said he had seen the same bacterium in cancer sufferers, and proposed a homeopathic preparation (which he claimed to have isolated in a duck) as a remedy for the Spanish flu.
In addition, it is now known that influenza is caused by a virus and not a bacterium.The preparation is derived from duck liver and heart, diluted to 200C—a ratio of one part duck offal to 10400 parts water.
Homeopaths claim that the molecules leave an ""imprint"" in the dilution that causes a healing effect on the body, although there is no evidence that supports this mechanism or efficacy beyond placebo."
oyster shell,oyster shell,"Oyster is the common name for a number of different families of salt-water bivalve molluscs that live in marine or brackish habitats. In some species the valves are highly calcified, and many are somewhat irregular in shape. Many, but not all, oysters are in the superfamily Ostreoidea.
Some types of oysters are commonly consumed cooked or raw, and in some locales are regarded as a delicacy.  Some types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle.  Windowpane oysters are harvested for their translucent shells, which are used to make various kinds of decorative objects."
pagoda tree flower,pagoda tree flower,"Styphnolobium japonicum (L.) Schott, the Japanese pagoda tree (Chinese scholar tree, pagoda tree; syn. Sophora japonica) is a species of tree in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae.
It was formerly included within a broader interpretation of the genus Sophora. The species of Styphnolobium differ from Sophora in lacking the ability to form symbioses with rhizobia (nitrogen fixing bacteria) on their roots. It also differs from the related genus Calia (mescalbeans) in having deciduous leaves and flowers in axillary, not terminal, racemes. The leaves are alternate, pinnate, with 9–21 leaflets, and the flowers in pendulous racemes similar to those of the Black locust."
palm oil,palm oil,"Palm oil is naturally reddish in color because of a high beta-carotene content.
The differences are in color (raw palm kernel oil lacks carotenoids and is not red), and in saturated fat content: palm mesocarp oil is 49% saturated, while palm kernel oil and coconut oil are 81% and 86% saturated fats, respectively.
However, crude red palm oil that has been refined, bleached and deodorized, a common commodity called RBD palm oil, does not contain carotenoids.
The oil palm produces bunches containing many fruits with the fleshy mesocarp enclosing a kernel that is covered by a very hard shell.
One source reported that humans consumed an average 17 pounds (7.7 kg) of palm oil per person in 2015.The use of palm oil in food products has attracted the concern of environmental activist groups; the high oil yield of the trees has encouraged wider cultivation, leading to the clearing of forests in parts of Indonesia to make space for oil-palm monoculture."
pantothenic acid,pantothenic acid,"Pantothenic acid, also called vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin. Pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient. Animals require pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The anion is called pantothenate.
Pantothenic acid is the amide between pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name derives from the Greek pantothen, meaning ""from everywhere"", and small quantities of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in fortified whole-grain cereals, egg yolks, liver and dried mushrooms.  It is commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol (pantothenol), and as calcium pantothenate.
Pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933."
papaya,papaya,"The papaya (, US: ) (from Carib via Spanish), papaw () or pawpaw () is the plant Carica papaya, one of the 22 accepted species in the genus Carica of the family Caricaceae. Its origin is in the tropics of the Americas, perhaps from southern Mexico and neighboring Central America."

It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a nectarine.
The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe.
It belongs to the genus Prunus which includes the cherry, apricot, almond and plum, in the rose family.
Due to their close relatedness, the inside of a peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as persipan.Peaches and nectarines are the same species, even though they are regarded commercially as different fruits."
peanut oil,peanut oil,"Peanut oil, also known as groundnut oil or arachis oil, is a vegetable oil derived from peanuts. The oil has a strong peanut flavor and aroma.

pearl,pearl,"A pearl is a hard, glistening object produced within the soft tissue (specifically the mantle) of a living shelled mollusk or another animal, such as a conulariid.
Just like the shell of a mollusk, a pearl is composed of calcium carbonate (mainly aragonite or a mixture of aragonite and calcite) in minute crystalline form, which has been deposited in concentric layers.
The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries.
The most valuable pearls occur spontaneously in the wild, but are extremely rare.
Imitation pearls are also widely sold in inexpensive jewelry, but the quality of their iridescence is usually very poor and is easily distinguished from that of genuine pearls.
Whether wild or cultured, gem-quality pearls are almost always nacreous and iridescent, like the interior of the shell that produces them.
However, almost all species of shelled mollusks are capable of producing pearls (technically ""calcareous concretions"") of lesser shine or less spherical shape."

poppy capsule,poppy capsule,"Poppy straw (also known as opium straw, mowed opium straw, crushed poppy capsule, poppy chaff, or poppy husk) is derived from opium poppies (Papaver somniferum) that are harvested when fully mature and dried by mechanical means, minus the ripe poppy seeds.
The field dried leaves, stalk and seed pod are used in commercial manufacture of morphine or other poppy alkaloid derived drugs, by first processing the material to make poppy straw separating the seeds then making concentrate of poppy straw, where no extraction using traditional methods of latex extraction has been made.
It is the source of 90% of the world supply of legal morphine (for medical and scientific use) and in some countries it also is a source of illegal morphine, which could be processed into illegal heroin.The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs defines poppy straw as ""all parts (except the seeds) of the opium poppy, after mowing"".Decorative Dried Flower producer/growers and wholesalers, hand pick the decorative mature seeded pods/heads with or without the stalks for use as floral decorations for visual gratification in arrangements."
poria-cocos mushroom,poria-cocos mushroom,"Wolfiporia extensa (Peck) Ginns (syn. Poria cocos F.A.Wolf) is a fungus in the family Polyporaceae.  It is a wood-decay fungus but has a subterranean growth habit.  It is notable in the development of a large, long-lasting underground sclerotium that resembles a small coconut.  This sclerotium called ""(Chinese) Tuckahoe"" or fu-ling(茯苓, pīnyīn: fúlíng), is not the same as the true tuckahoe used as Indian bread by Native Americans, which is the arrow arum, Peltandra virginica, a flowering tuberous plant in the arum family. W. extensa is also used extensively as a medicinal mushroom in Chinese medicine. Indications for use in the traditional Chinese medicine include promoting urination, to invigorate the spleen function (i.e., digestive function), and to calm the mind.Common names include hoelen, poria, tuckahoe, China root, fu ling (茯苓, pīnyīn: fúlíng), and matsuhodo."
prepared aconite,prepared aconite,"Aconitic acid is an organic acid. The two isomers are cis-aconitic acid and trans-aconitic acid. The conjugate base of cis-aconitic acid, cis-aconitate is an intermediate in the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle. It is acted upon by the enzyme aconitase.
Aconitic acid can be synthesized by dehydration of citric acid using sulfuric acid:
(HO2CCH2)2C(OH)CO2H  → HO2CCH=C(CO2H)CH2CO2H  +  H2OA mixture of isomers are generated in this way.
It was first prepared by thermal dehydration."
prepared rehmannia,prepared rehmannia,"Guīlínggāo, also known as Tortoise Jelly (though not technically correct) or Turtle Jelly, is a jelly-like Chinese medicine, also sold as a dessert. It was traditionally made from the powdered plastron (bottom shell) from the  turtle Cuora trifasciata (commonly known as ""three-lined box turtle"", or ""golden coin turtle"", 金錢龜) and a variety of herbal products, in particular, China roots Smilax glabra (土伏苓, Tu fu ling).
Although the golden coin turtle  (Cuora trifasciata) is commercially farmed in modern China, it is extremely expensive; therefore, even when turtle-derived ingredients are used in commercially available guīlínggāo, they come from other, more commonly available, turtle species.More often, commercially available guīlínggāo sold as a dessert does not contain turtle shell powder. They share the same herbal additives as the medicine and are similarly marketed as being good for skin complexion when ingested."

It is found from Chiapas, Mexico to western Panama (unlike the other quetzals of the genus Pharomachrus, which are found in South America and eastern Panama). It is well known for its colorful plumage. There are two subspecies, P. m. mocinno and P. m. costaricensis.
The resplendent quetzal plays an important role in various types of Mesoamerican mythology. It is the national bird of Guatemala, and its image is found on the country's flag and coat of arms. It also lends its name to the country's currency, the Guatemalan quetzal (abbreviation GTQ)."
propolis,propolis,"Propolis or bee glue is a resinous mixture that honey bees produce by mixing saliva and beeswax with exudate gathered from tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources. It is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Propolis is used for small gaps (approximately 6 millimeters (0.24 in) or less), while larger spaces are usually filled with beeswax. Its color varies depending on its botanical source, with dark brown as the most common. Propolis is sticky at and above 20 °C (68 °F), while at lower temperatures, it becomes hard and brittle.
While foraging, worker bees primarily harvest pollen and nectar, while also collecting water and tree resin necessary for the production of propolis. The chemical composition and nature of propolis depend on environmental conditions and harvested resources."
pu'er tea,pu'er tea,"This process is a Chinese specialty and produces tea known as 黑茶 hēichá (literally, 'black tea') commonly translated as 'dark tea'.

Pu'er traditionally begins as a raw product known as ""rough"" máochá (毛茶, literally ""fuzzy/furry tea"") and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as ""raw"" shēngchá (生茶, literally ""raw tea"").
The wòduī (渥堆) fermentation process developed in 1973 by the Kunming Tea Factory created a new type of pu'er tea.
This process involves an accelerated fermentation into ""ripe"" shóuchá (熟茶, literally ""ripe tea"") which is then stored loose or pressed into various shapes.
All types of pu'er can be stored to mature before consumption, which is why it is commonly labeled with the year and region of production."
pubescent angelica root,Angelica acutiloba,"It is now distributed widely and cultivated in Jilin, China, Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia.The common name of Angelica acutiloba is known as tōki (トウキ, 当帰) in Japanese.

(See #Etymology) The Japanese name, tōki (トウキ, 当帰), has a literally meaning like “recovering good health”."
puff-ball,puff-ball,"Puffballs are fungi, so named because clouds of brown dust-like spores are emitted when the mature fruitbody bursts or is impacted.
The puffballs were previously treated as a taxonomic group called the Gasteromycetes or Gasteromycetidae, but they are now known to be a polyphyletic assemblage.
Instead, spores are produced internally, in a spheroidal fruitbody called a gasterothecium (gasteroid ('stomach-like') basidiocarp).
As the spores mature, they form a mass called a gleba in the centre of the fruitbody that is often of a distinctive color and texture.
None of the stalked puffballs are edible as they are tough and woody mushrooms.
The Hymenogastrales and Enteridium lycoperdon, a slime mold, are the false puffballs.
A gleba which is powdery on maturity is a feature of true puffballs, stalked puffballs and earthstars.
False puffballs are hard like rock or brittle.
All false puffballs are inedible, as they are tough and bitter to taste."

sativus or Raphanus sativus) is an edible root vegetable of the family Brassicaceae that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times.
Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable with bite.
Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate.
They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases.
They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, common smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months.
Being easy to grow and quick to harvest, radishes are often planted by novice gardeners.
Another use of radish is as a cover or catch crop in winter, or as a forage crop.
Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production."
ramine root ,Digital rhetoric,"Digital rhetoric is a way of informing, persuading, and inspiring action in an audience through digital media that is composed, created, and distributed through multimedia platforms. Rhetoric, the practices of ""making meaning for particular audiences and purposes,"" differs from digital rhetoric in that it connects to fields outside of rhetoric, it opens rhetorical theory to new theories and methods, and it offers the potential for a new field of study. Because of this shift in rhetoric, the relationship between writers and readers has changed in form and communication style. Digital rhetoric can also help strengthen a reader's connection to the text by allowing them to directly interact with it. Both rhetoric and digital rhetoric hold different meanings according to different scholars."

When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks gills on its underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores. Depending on the age of the mushroom, the pores on its underside may be white or brown.Lingzhi mushroom is used in traditional Chinese medicine. In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially that of the maple. Only two or three out of 10,000 such aged trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is extremely rare. Today, lingzhi is effectively cultivated on hardwood logs or sawdust/woodchips."

saccharomyces boulardii,saccharomyces boulardii,"Saccharomyces boulardii is a tropical species of yeast first isolated from lychee and mangosteen fruit in 1923 by French scientist Henri Boulard.
Although early reports described distinct taxonomic, metabolic, and genetic properties, S.
boulardii is a strain of S.
cerevisiae, sharing >99% genomic relatedness, giving the synonym S.
cerevisiae var boulardii.
A type strain is Hansen CBS 5926.S. boulardii is sometimes used as a probiotic with the purpose of introducing beneficial microbes into the large and small intestines and conferring protection against pathogens.
It grows at 37 °C (98.6 °F).
In addition, the popular genome-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 was proven to be effective in S.
boulardii.
Boulard first isolated this yeast after he observed natives of Southeast Asia chewing on the skin of lychee and mangosteen in an attempt to control the symptoms of cholera.
In healthy patients, S.
boulardii has been shown to be nonpathogenic and nonsystemic (it remains in the gastrointestinal tract rather than spreading elsewhere in the body)."
safflower,safflower,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) is a highly branched, herbaceous, thistle-like annual plant. It is commercially cultivated for vegetable oil extracted from the seeds and was used by the early Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande as a substitute for saffron. Plants are 30 to 150 cm (12 to 59 in) tall with globular flower heads having yellow, orange, or red flowers. Each branch will usually have from one to five flower heads containing 15 to 20 seeds per head. Safflower is native to arid environments having seasonal rain. It grows a deep taproot which enables it to thrive in such environments."
saffron,saffron,"Saffron (pronounced  or ) is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the ""saffron crocus"".
Saffron has long been the world's most costly spice by weight.
Although some doubts remain on its origin, it is believed that saffron originated in Iran.
However, Greece and Mesopotamia have also been suggested as the possible region of origin of this plant: Harold McGee  states that it was domesticated in or near Greece during the Bronze Age. C.
sativus is possibly a triploid form of Crocus cartwrightianus, which is itself native to Greece and Crete.
Saffron crocus slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia and was later brought to parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania.
Saffron's taste and iodoform- or hay-like fragrance result from the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal.
Iran now accounts for approximately 90% of the world production of saffron."

sargassum,sargassum,"Sargassum is a genus of brown (class Phaeophyceae) macroalgae (seaweed) in the order Fucales. Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. Most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold-water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, but the genus Sargassum appears to be an exception. Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic—reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycles. The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of Sargassum."
scallion,scallion,"Scallions (also known as green onions, spring onions, or salad onions) are vegetables of various Allium onion species.  Scallions have a milder taste than most onions. Their close relatives include garlic, shallot, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.Although the bulbs of many Allium species are used as food, the defining characteristic of scallion species is that they lack a fully developed bulb. Allium species referred to as scallions have hollow, tubular green leaves growing directly from the bulb. These leaves are used as a vegetable; they are eaten either raw or cooked. The leaves are often chopped into other dishes, in the manner of onions or garlic."

shark cartilage,shark cartilage,"Shark cartilage is marketed under a variety of brand names, including Carticin, Cartilade, or BeneFin, and is marketed explicitly or implicitly as a treatment or preventive for various illnesses, including cancer.
There is no scientific evidence that shark cartilage is useful in treating or preventing cancer or other diseases.
However, shark cartilage supplements are still marketed using the misconception that sharks do not get cancer, a myth that was as popularized by the 1992 book Sharks Don't Get Cancer.
Scientists have since discovered 40 benign and cancerous tumors in 18 of the 1,168 species of sharks.
Numerous cancers in sharks, including tumors in shark cartilage, were documented by Gary Ostrander and his colleagues from the University of Hawaii in research published in 2004.The ongoing consumption of shark cartilage supplements has been linked to a significant decline in shark populations and the popularity of these supplements has been described as a triumph of pseudoscience and marketing over scientific evaluation."

stem of taiwan erycibe,Chinese herbology,"Chinese herbology (simplified Chinese: 中药学; traditional Chinese: 中藥學; pinyin: zhōngyào xué) is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
A Nature editorial described TCM as ""fraught with pseudoscience"", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized, among which some are poisonous.
Thus, the term ""medicinal"" (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (pinyin: yào).Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy.
There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs."

stevia,stevia,"Stevia () is a sweetener and sugar substitute derived from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana, native to Brazil and Paraguay.
The body does not metabolize the glycosides in stevia, so it contains zero calories like some artificial sweeteners.
Stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, and some of its extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations.
The legal status of stevia as a food additive or dietary supplement varies from country to country.
In the United States, high-purity stevia glycoside extracts have been generally recognized as safe (GRAS) since 2008, and are allowed in food products, but stevia leaf and crude extracts do not have GRAS or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for use in food.

Originally native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and western North Africa, it is now found worldwide, including New Zealand and  North America. The species is divided into six subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation upon contact (""contact urticaria"", a form of contact dermatitis). The plant has a long history of use as a source for traditional medicine, food, tea, and textile raw material in ancient societies."
storax,Dry cask storage,"Ideally, the steel cylinder provides leak-tight containment of the spent fuel.
Each cylinder is surrounded by additional steel, concrete, or other material to provide radiation shielding to workers and members of the public.
With some designs, the steel cylinders containing the fuel are placed vertically in a concrete vault; other designs orient the cylinders horizontally.
The concrete vaults provide the radiation shielding.
Other cask designs orient the steel cylinder vertically on a concrete pad at a dry cask storage site and use both metal and concrete outer cylinders for radiation shielding.
Currently there is no long term permanent storage facility; dry cask storage is designed as an interim safer solution than spent fuel pool storage.

It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form.
It has a perfect basal cleavage, uneven flat fracture and it is foliated with a two dimensional platy form.
The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on scratch hardness comparison, ranging from 1-10, a value of 10 being the hardest of minerals.
Talc is the defining value 1 therefore the softest of  minerals.
Any mineral below a value of 2 on Mohs scale of mineral hardness can be scratched by a fingernail.
When scraped on a streak plate it produces a white streak, though this indicator is of little importance because most silicate minerals produce a white streak.
Talc is translucent to opaque with colors ranging from whitish grey to green with a vitreous and pearly luster."

thunder ball,thunder ball,"Ball lightning is an unexplained and potentially dangerous atmospheric electrical phenomenon.
Two reports from the nineteenth century claim that the ball eventually explodes, leaving behind an odor of sulfur.
The actual existence of lightning ball phenomena is not proven, but appears in a variety of accounts over the centuries.
Until the 1960s, most scientists treated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world.
Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries.
Scientific data on natural ball-lightning remains scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability.
Owing to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown.
The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball-lightning event was published in January 2014, and included a video at high frame-rate."

tinosporae radix,Chinese herbology,"Chinese herbology (simplified Chinese: 中药学; traditional Chinese: 中藥學; pinyin: zhōngyào xué) is the theory of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts for the majority of treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).
A Nature editorial described TCM as ""fraught with pseudoscience"", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.The term herbology is misleading in the sense that, while plant elements are by far the most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized, among which some are poisonous.
Thus, the term ""medicinal"" (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (pinyin: yào).Research into the effectiveness of traditional Chinese herbal therapy is of poor quality and often tainted by bias, with little or no rigorous evidence of efficacy.
There are concerns over a number of potentially toxic Chinese herbs."

woad leaf,Natural dye,"Throughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson kermes, became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world.
Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth.
Synthetic dyes, which could be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution, and unlike natural dyes, were suitable for the synthetic fibres that followed.
Artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement preferred the pure shades and subtle variability of natural dyes, which mellow with age but preserve their true colors, unlike early synthetic dyes, and helped ensure that the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs were preserved for use by home and craft dyers."
woad root,woad root,"The root word is the primary lexical unit of a word, and of a word family (this root is then called the base word), which carries the most significant aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.
Content words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of root morphemes.
However, sometimes the term ""root"" is also used to describe the word minus its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place.
For example, chatters has the inflectional root or lemma chatter, but the lexical root chat.
Inflectional roots are often called stems, and a root in the stricter sense may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem.
However, in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term ""root"" is generally synonymous with ""free morpheme"".
Many such languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word: Yup'ik, for instance, has no more than two thousand."
