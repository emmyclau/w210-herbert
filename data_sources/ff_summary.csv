Anemone chinensis,Anemone chinensis is a basionym of the currently known Pulsatilla chinensis and is one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. There it has the name bái tóu wēng (Chinese: 白头翁).
Anisodus tanguticus,"It has a significant impact in China as one of the 50 fundamental herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine.The generic name Anisodus is a compound of the Greek words ἄνισος (ánisos, 'unequal') and ὀδούς (odoús, 'tooth'), hence signifying 'having teeth of different lengths' – so called from the observation that certain species have calyces featuring lobes or teeth of unequal length.
This can be attributed not only to the effects of over-collection, as a medicinal species, but also to a low rate of seed germination in A.
A study was conducted in an effort to find the most effective method of breaking seed dormancy in the species in order to increase rates of germination.
The study was undertaken in an effort to find ways of increasing the population of the plant.Anisodus tanguticus is found growing (on grassy sunny slopes) principally on the Tibetan Plateau, its range extending from the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and Yunnan in the east, through Qinghai and Gansu to the northwest, Tibet in the west, and Nepal in the south."

sinensis is native to East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia, but it is today cultivated across the world in tropical and subtropical regions.
The young, light-green leaves are preferably harvested for tea production; they have short, white hairs on the underside.
sinensis differs from other caffeine-producing plants such as coffee or guayusa.
Analysis of the pathway was carried out by harvesting young leaves and using reverse transcription PCR to analyze the genes encoding the major enzymes involved in synthesizing caffeine."
Cannabis sativa,"Cannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous flowering plant indigenous to eastern Asia but now of cosmopolitan distribution due to widespread cultivation.
The word ""sativa"" means things that are cultivated.A Cannabis plant in the vegetative growth phase of its life requires more than 12–13 hours of light per day to stay vegetative.
Tissue culture multiplication has become important in producing medically important clones, while seed production remains the generally preferred means of multiplication.Data related to Cannabis sativa at Wikispecies
Popular Sativa Marijuana StrainsBeside cannabinoids, Cannabis chemical constituents include about 120 compounds responsible for its characteristic aroma.
Trans-caryophyllene
A nominal if not legal distinction is often made between industrial hemp, with concentrations of psychoactive compounds far too low to be useful for that purpose, and marijuana.The flowers of Cannabis sativa are unisexual and plants are most often either male or female.
Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual expression."
Carthamus tinctorius,"In coloring textiles, dried safflower flowers are used as a natural dye source for the orange-red pigment carthamin.
""The explanation is that there are two parts of the plant which can be used; the pale seeds and the red florets.""The early Spanish colonies along the Rio Grande in New Mexico used safflower as a substitute for saffron in traditional recipes.
Other significant producers were Mexico and Kazakhstan.Traditionally, the crop was grown for its seeds, and used for coloring and flavoring foods, in medicines, and making red (carthamin) and yellow dyes, especially before cheaper aniline dyes became available.
For the last fifty years or so, the plant has been cultivated mainly for the vegetable oil extracted from its seeds.In Japan, dyers have mastered the technique of producing a bright red to orange-red dye (known as carthamin) from the dried florets of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius)."
